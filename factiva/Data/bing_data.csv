1,Elon Musk started a price war that Tesla can't win,Yahoo News UK,2023-11-11,Tesla has spent the past year slashing its prices to try and drive away the competition. That's a losing strategy.,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/elon-musk-started-price-war-112201768.html,"Elon Musk has started an electric-vehicle price war that Tesla can't finish. Under increasing pressure from new competition, Tesla spent the past year slashing the average price of its models by roughly 25%. The Model 3 fell from $48,000 to $44,380. The luxury Model S, meanwhile, plunged from a high of $130,000 to $96,380. The cars, as they say, have been priced to move. It's an unusual business strategy, to put it mildly. ""I can't think of another point in the history of automotive when a brand that wasn't going out of business cut prices 20% a year,"" Mark Schirmer, the director of communications at the research firm Cox Automotive, told me. Tesla is hoping that lower prices will drive up sales and slow the advance of the company's rivals — maybe even scare some of them out of the market altogether. But that's not what's happening. Lower prices are not translating into higher sales. The number of cars Tesla delivered to customers in the third quarter actually declined. Revenue is dropping, and the company's once fat profit margins are getting squeezed — down to 17.9% in the third quarter, compared with 25.1% a year ago. Competitors aren't being driven out of business, either. Once totally dominant in the EV space, Tesla's share of the US market has fallen from 62% at the beginning of the year to only 50% today. To make matters worse, the public's appetite for EVs isn't growing as fast as automakers expected. That means Tesla has set off a protracted battle for a piece of a pie that's growing crumb by crumb. ""If you do the price war, you have to make sure you have enough volume to increase and maintain profitability,"" John Zhang, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School, said. ""It has to be a continuous battle. This war you have to wage all the way. And you need to plan ahead. That's how you win."" Conversely, some experts will tell you that price wars are unwinnable — that they're a race to the bottom that serves only to kill profitability for the entire industry. And in an industry where the underlying technology — and, thus, the costs of production — are changing rapidly, no one can be sure where the bottom is. Winnable or not, Musk chose a terrible time to pick a fight. As legacy automakers walk the tightrope to our electric future, they can rely on sales of their traditional combustion-engine vehicles to provide them with a safety net. Tesla has no safety net. For Musk, it's go electric, or bust. Musk's decision to offer deep discounts on his vehicles was an act of pure desperation. That became apparent earlier this month when Tesla reported its third-quarter numbers. The results were frightful across the board: Tesla missed Wall Street's expectations on revenue, vehicle deliveries, and free cash flow, which was down to $848 million from $3.4 billion a year before. Most importantly, the company reported that its gross margins — a measure of the company's profitability after costs — continued to shrink. This horrified investors who had just gotten used to Tesla making money. Over the past two years, despite Tesla's addition of more moderately priced vehicles such as the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y compact SUV, its margins have grown to be some of the fattest in the car business. That has bolstered the argument that Tesla wasn't a traditional car company such as Ford or GM and deserved its much, much higher stock price. Naturally, this is a status Musk would like Tesla to keep, so he's promised to do everything he can to cut costs. (On the conference call on third-quarter earnings, he said it's like ""'Game of Thrones,' but with pennies."") Unfortunately, cost cuts can't be spoken into existence, not even by Musk. In the third quarter, Tesla's capital expenditures actually ballooned to their highest level in a year — $2.4 billion, up from $1.8 billion a year ago. If prices are going down, and costs are going up, even the most fervent of Musk's Wall Street believers will tell you that margins don't have a prayer. Musk gave no indication of when this cash drought would end or how margins would improve. He could not say when the company's Cybertruck would be available to the public and even admitted that Tesla had ""dug its own grave"" trying to build the new vehicle. He also could not provide details on when there would be a meaningful update to the aging models that currently make up Tesla's fleet. But there was one thing Musk was clear on: Prices need to keep coming down. In a call that Wall Street widely acknowledged as one of Tesla's worst in some time, it was like a mantra Musk repeated over and over again, with a certainty borne more of faith than facts. ""So I just can't emphasize again how important cost is,"" Musk said. ""It's not an optional thing for most people. It is a necessary thing. We have to make our cars more affordable so that people can buy them."" The only real hope Musk offered investors was a suggestion that driverless-car technology would (eventually, someday) offset Tesla's falling prices. But how exactly the math would work on that trade-off was unclear. Months into his pricing campaign, Musk has nothing to show for it, and no plans to change. The market responded to Musk's disappearing profits by dragging Tesla's stock down 15%. Tesla's dismal results illuminated Musk's short-term reason for the desperate pricing strategy. But the underlying reason is even more alarming: Despite increasing demand and bountiful government investment, the world's transition from gas to electric cars is not going as smoothly as automakers expected. Experts will tell you with certainty that EVs are the future and that internal-combustion engines will eventually disappear from America's driveways and parking lots. But the march to electrified highways isn't proceeding in a straight line. There are two main reasons that consumer appetite for EVs hasn't been as robust as automakers initially expected. One is the uneven way new technologies are adopted; it inevitably takes awhile to sell people on even the most amazing innovation. The other is the slowing global economy. Customers around the world have become more price-sensitive, which is bad news for EVs: While the average selling price of an electric vehicle is going down — from $65,000 last year to $53,633 in July — it's still higher than the average selling price for new vehicles overall, which hovers around $48,451. Traditional carmakers, from Ford and GM to BMW and Mercedes, have responded to the EV price challenge by doing what they do best: building the gas cars that customers still want. ""Ford is able to balance production of gas, hybrid, and electric vehicles to match the speed of EV adoption in a way that others can't,"" John Lawler, Ford's chief financial officer, said during the company's latest earnings call. ""That's obviously good for customers, who get the products they want — and good for us, too, because disciplined capital allocation and not chasing scale at all costs maximizes profitability and cash flow."" But while the traditional automakers can coast on their older models, Tesla doesn't have that option. Cue the price cuts. ""Musk's starting a price war,"" Schirmer of Cox Automotive said. ""I do think there was nothing else he could do, in that he doesn't have anything really new to compete against these other companies. He says it isn't because he has a demand problem. But I've been in this business a long time, and I have never seen anyone cut prices without having a demand problem."" Musk's goal to undercut the rest of the market on price is no secret — and it's made other car companies none too happy. Given the uncertainty around the future of EVs, almost every other automaker is reluctant to slash prices on their models because doing so would make continued investment in EV tech an even tougher business case to make. In April, Ford CEO Jim Farley said Tesla's cuts could start an unsustainable price war. But the company still felt forced to cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E SUV at least twice this year. Many auto executives are refusing to engage in Musk's fight because they know from experience that the best way to win a price war is not to get into one in the first place. ""We have no interest in sinking prices to gain market share,"" BMW CEO Oliver Zipse said in a recent call with investors. ""That's not our strategy."" There are other, more imaginative, more savvy ways to entice customers without a fire sale. During the 2008 recession, rather than slashing prices, Hyundai tried to figure out what was holding customers back from buying a new car. Turns out, it was worries over getting laid off. So Hyundai offered customers a guarantee: Anyone who bought a car and then lost their job could sell it back to the company. That's the kind of creative work-around that gets a car company through hard times unscathed. It's an exercise in market research and advertising. Tesla has given little indication that it does the former and has flatly rejected doing the latter. Musk has always maintained that his outsize public profile makes advertising for Tesla a waste. ""Rationally, he doesn't have to drop prices so fast. He can only delay the competition,"" Navdeep Sodhi, a managing director at the pricing consultancy Sodhi Pricing, said. ""If Elon was smart, he would not drop the price. Instead, he should justify the cost of ownership."" Part of the point of advertising — and the reason investors are pushing Tesla to start spending money on it — is to educate customers about why Tesla's vehicles are worth their higher price tags. According to Sodhi, Tesla has a compelling argument to make about how much money EVs can save customers over time. Why slash prices if you can persuade customers to pay more? Building a market for a product such as an electric vehicle is a marathon, not a sprint. Traditional carmakers expect to lose money on their EVs for the foreseeable future. Tesla just became profitable in 2021. If it slides back into the red because of its price cuts, expect investors to run in another direction. If the short-term point of Tesla's price cuts is to maintain its market share and sell more cars, it's not working. At the same time, the move could damage Tesla in the long term. When companies play with price, Zhang said, they're playing with customer expectations. Once customers get used to paying $40,000 for a standard EV, they're not going to go back to $60,000. In a price war, you may prompt a few more people to buy from you today, but you'll be sacrificing millions of dollars in future sales. Then there are all the customers who paid that $60,000 in the past. Learning that they could have saved thousands of dollars if they'd waited a few months to make their purchase has a negative impact on brand loyalty. In China, Tesla's price cuts even sparked protests among owners who paid more for their vehicles. But Musk isn't thinking about the future. He needs the money he hopes to make from price cuts — and he needs it now. Making cars is an expensive business, and if the price cuts don't generate more demand, Tesla's fortune could change rather quickly. ""If you have a factory that makes something and you're not selling it, you're losing huge money in automotive,"" Schirmer said. This is a moment when you want an experienced team of automotive executives at the helm of your company. Instead, Tesla is onboarding a new chief financial officer. Zach Kirkhorn — a Tesla veteran of 13 years who presided over the most profitable quarters in the company's history — stepped down as chief financial officer in August. According to company documents, his severance package included the kind of payoff and strict nondisparagement requirements that reek of a C-suite firing. In the end, price cuts won't be enough to drive sales. If Tesla is going to keep its business healthy, it needs to appeal to new customers beyond Musk fans and early adopters. It needs to conduct research and launch advertising that makes the right argument, to the right customers, that one of Tesla's four models is the right car for them. Discounting the sticker price may drive a few sales. But in the long run, you can't build a global automotive juggernaut without cash flow. Musk himself has admitted that Tesla narrowly evaded death by cash burn in both 2008 and 2018. Waging price war during a downturn is a challenge unlike any Tesla has faced before. The company has survived for years on a first-mover advantage, on being small and nimble, and on the willingness of investors to bail it out. But today's Tesla is increasingly a normal car company, with normal car-company problems. Musk's unfulfilled promises of robo-taxis and unmatched artificial intelligence may dazzle the market for a while, but they're not driving the sales Tesla needs to win the price war it started. The company has a growing fleet of competition, an expensive manufacturing process, and shareholders who have grown used to fat profits. If cutting prices is all Tesla can do to survive this new reality, it will continue to bleed money every time the rubber hits the road. And at some point, turning it around may no longer be an option. Linette Lopez is a senior correspondent at Insider.

Three former supervisors at SpaceX explained how Musk even had machinery painted in industrial safety yellow repainted in black or blue based on his aesthetic preferences.  Some workers were also reportedly instructed not to wear yellow safety vests when Musk was present. Managers also sometimes told workers to replace yellow safety tape with red, the supervisors said.  A investigation by Reuters revealed SpaceX had at least 600 unreported worker injuries since 2014, including eight incidents resulting in amputations.  Elon Musk discouraged employees from wearing yellow-colored safety clothes, SpaceX workers have said Musk doesn't like bright colors and has even had yellow machinery painted black or blue while yellow safety tape has been replaced with red. Pictured, inside of SpaceX in Hawthorne, California facility Musk himself at times appeared cavalier about safety on visits to SpaceX sites: Four employees said he sometimes played with a novelty flamethrower. For years, Musk and his deputies found it 'hilarious' to wave the flamethrower around, firing it near other people and giggling 'like they were in middle school,' one engineer said.  Musk tweeted in 2018 that the flamethrower was 'guaranteed to liven up any party!' At SpaceX, Musk played with the device in close-quarters office settings, said the engineer, who at one point feared Musk would set someone's hair on fire.  Last year, an open letter penned by some SpaceX employees criticized Musk's behavior as a 'source of distraction and embarrassment.'  Musk is known for running his companies with a high level of intensity, occasionally implementing work sprints and reportedly sleeping on the factory floor at Tesla. At one incident at Musk's SpaceX facility in McGregor, Texas, Lonnie LeBlanc and his co-workers realized they had a problem. They needed to transport foam insulation to the rocket company's main hangar but had no straps to secure the cargo.  Musk himself at times appeared cavalier about safety on visits to SpaceX sites: Four employees said he sometimes played with a novelty flamethrower Videos posted online show it can shoot a thick flame more than five feet long. Musk played with the device in close-quarters office settings, said the engineer, who at one point feared Musk would set someone´s hair on fire LeBlanc, a relatively new employee, offered a solution to hold down the load: He sat on it. After the truck drove away, a gust of wind blew LeBlanc and the insulation off the trailer, slamming him headfirst into the pavement. LeBlanc, 38, who had retired nine months earlier from the U.S. Marine Corps. He was pronounced dead from head trauma at the scene. Federal inspectors with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) later determined that SpaceX had failed to protect LeBlanc from a clear hazard, noting the gravity and severity of the violation.  LeBlanc's co-workers told OSHA that SpaceX had no convenient access to tie-downs and no process or oversight for handling such loads. SpaceX acknowledged the problems, and the agency instructed the company to make seven specific safety improvements, including more training and equipment, according to the inspection report. Many of the 600 documented injuries over the last nine years have been serious or disabling.  Any machinery painted in safety yellow such as at this GE energy plant, was painted in blue or black at SpaceX SpaceX technicians work on the Crew Dragon Demo-2 craft at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California. There's virtually nothing painted yellow in sight Records included reports of more than 100 workers suffering cuts or lacerations, 29 with broken bones or dislocations, 17 whose hands or fingers were 'crushed,' and nine with head injuries, including one skull fracture, four concussions and one traumatic brain injury.  The cases also included five burns, five electrocutions, eight accidents that led to amputations, 12 injuries involving multiple unspecified body parts, and seven workers with eye injuries.  Others were relatively minor, including more than 170 reports of strains or sprains. The more than 600 SpaceX injuries represent only a portion of the total case count.  OSHA has required companies to report their total number of injuries annually since 2016, but SpaceX facilities failed to submit reports for most of those years. The 600-plus injuries were calculated by examining court documents in worker lawsuits, employee medical records, state workers´ compensation claims and emergency-call records.  Last year, an open letter penned by some SpaceX employees criticized Musk's behavior as a 'source of distraction and embarrassment.' SpaceX, founded by Musk more than two decades ago, takes the stance that workers are responsible for protecting themselves, according to more than a dozen current and former employees, including a former senior executive Another severe injury occurred in January 2022 following a series of safety failures at SpaceX, according to eight former SpaceX employees familiar with the accident.  In that case, a part flew off during pressure testing of a Raptor V2 rocket engine - fracturing the skull of employee Francisco Cabada and putting him in a coma. Senior managers at the Hawthorne, California site had been repeatedly warned about the dangers of rushing the engine's development, along with inadequate training of staff and testing of components.  The part that failed and struck the worker had a flaw that was discovered, but not fixed, before the testing, two of the employees said. Cabada's wife said the company has ignored the family's attempts to find out why he wasn't protected.  'It would have been nice to get a call from Elon Musk,' Ydy Cabada said. 'But I guess workers are just disposable to them.' Current and former employees said such injuries reflect a chaotic workplace where often under-trained and overtired staff routinely skipped basic safety procedures as they raced to meet Musk's aggressive deadlines for space missions.  SpaceX, founded by Musk more than two decades ago, takes the stance that workers are responsible for protecting themselves, according to more than a dozen current and former employees, including a former senior executive. The lax safety culture, more than a dozen current and former employees said, stems in part from Musk's disdain for perceived bureaucracy and a belief inside SpaceX that it's leading an urgent quest to create a refuge in space from a dying Earth. 'Elon's concept that SpaceX is on this mission to go to Mars as fast as possible and save humanity permeates every part of the company,' said Tom Moline, a former SpaceX senior avionics engineer fired after raising workplace complaints. 'The company justifies casting aside anything that could stand in the way of accomplishing that goal, including worker safety.' SpaceX´s poor safety record underscores the perils of working in the lightly regulated and fast-expanding U.S. space industry.  SpaceX has achieved major breakthroughs. It was the first private company to send humans into orbit.  Its Starlink unit is now the world's largest satellite operator. Competitors including Jeff Bezos´ Blue Origin have struggled to keep pace with SpaceX´s reusable rockets, which have slashed launch costs. Some SpaceX engineers say they relish collaborating with creative coworkers in an environment with little bureaucracy. The 2022 injury rate at the company's manufacturing-and-launch facility near Brownsville, Texas, was 4.8 injuries or illnesses per 100 workers - six times higher than the space-industry average of 0.8. Its rocket-testing facility in McGregor, Texas, where LeBlanc died, had a rate of 2.7, more than three times the average.  The rate at its Hawthorne, California, manufacturing facility was more than double the average at 1.8 injuries per 100 workers.  The company's facility in Redmond, Washington, had a rate of 0.8, the same as the industry average.

3,Obesity drug Wegovy taken by former UK prime minister Boris Johnson and Elon Musk cuts risk of cardiac failure by 20% in people with existing heart problems,Daily Mail,2023-10-22,"New research indicates the obesity drug Wegovy taken by Elon Musk and former UK prime minister Boris Johnson, cuts risk of ...",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12738411/Obesity-drug-Wegovy-cuts-risk-cardiac-20-heart-problems.html,"By Noa Halff For Dailymail.Com and Associated Press   Published:  21:56, 11 November 2023   |  Updated:  13:22, 12 November 2023      30 View  comments  New research indicates the obesity drug Wegovy taken by Elon Musk and former UK prime minister Boris Johnson, cuts risk of cardiac failure by 20 percent in people with existing heart problems.  The research in the large, international study is the first to document an obesity medication that can not only shed pounds, but also safely prevent a heart attack, stroke or heart-related deaths in people who have heart disease — but not diabetes. The results were published Saturday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at a medical conference in Philadelphia.  Experts say the findings can change the way doctors treat certain heart patients and shift perceptions that the new class of obesity drugs are cosmetic treatments - placing pressure on health insurers to cover them. 'It moves from a kind of therapy that reduces body weight to a therapy that reduces cardiovascular events,' Dr. Michael Lincoff, the study's lead author and a heart expert at the Cleveland Clinic, said to the Associated Press.  New research indicates the obesity drug Wegovy taken by Elon Musk and former UK prime minister Boris Johnson , cuts risk of cardiac failure by 20 percent in people with existing heart problems Tech mogul Elon Musk has lost about 30 pounds with the help of weight-loss injectables Former British Prime Minister, 58, Boris Johnson wrote a Dailymail.com article in June, where he wrote about his experience on the weight loss medication Wegovy is a high-dose version of the diabetes treatment Ozempic, which already has been shown to reduce the risk of serious heart problems in people who have diabetes.  It is nearly the same as Ozempic, but Wegovy was explicitly approved to treat overweight and obesity, whereas Ozempic was initially cleared to help treat type 2 diabetes.  The Tesla billionaire Elon Musk, 52, said last year that his secret to achieving a 'fit, ripped, and healthy' body is fasting, adding in a subsequent Tweet, 'And Wegovy.' Before Wegovy's approval, doctors around the US were doling out prescriptions for Ozempic 'off label' at about a thousand dollars a pop. Musk has not said consistently whether the medication he took was branded Wegovy or Ozempic, but both medications can cause major weight loss and a reduction of body fat. He said in October that he had lost nearly 30lbs with the medication's help, in combination with fasting and 'no tasty food'. Former British Prime Minister, 58, Boris Johnson  wrote about his experience on the weight loss medication in a Dailymail.com article in June.  He explained how he had to stop taking the controversial, popular slimming drug as it made him ill. 'I must have been losing four or five pounds a week — maybe more — when all at once it started to go wrong. I don’t know why, exactly,' he wrote. 'Maybe it was something to do with constantly flying around the world, and changing time zones, but I started to dread the injections, because they were making me feel ill.'  It may not work for all but Johnson said he supports the medication for those it helps.  The results were published Saturday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at a medical conference in Philadelphia  'I see nothing morally wrong in using these drugs to help you lose weight, any more than it is wrong to use an electrically assisted bicycle to get up the hill. Even for us fatties, it turns out, there is such a thing as satiety — and science has found it.'  The new study looked to see if the same was true in those who don't have that disease. Experts have known for years that losing weight can improve heart health, but there hasn't been a safe and effective obesity medication proven to reduce specific risks, said Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, a heart expert at the Mayo Clinic.  He expects the new findings to change treatment guidelines and 'dominate the conversation' for years to come. 'This is the population who needs the medicine the most,' said Lopez-Jimenez, who had no role in the study. In the US, there are about 6.6 million people like those tested in the study, experts said. Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy and Ozempic, has asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to include the heart benefits on Wegovy's label, like on Ozempic's. The new study, paid for by the company, included more than 17,500 people in 41 countries.  Participants were age 45 and older, had a body mass index of 27 or higher and were tracked for more than three years on average. They took typical drugs for their heart conditions, but they were also randomly assigned to receive weekly injections of Wegovy or a dummy shot.  Emily Wright, 38, a teacher in Toronto, had to quit her job after gastroparesis left her vomiting several times a day.  The study found that 569, or 6.5 percent, of those who got the drug versus 701, or 8 percent, of those who received the dummy shot had a heart attack or stroke or died from a heart-related cause.  That's an overall reduction of 20 percent in the risk of those outcomes, the researchers reported. The drop appeared to be fueled primarily by the difference in heart attacks, but the number of serious health complications reported were too small to tell whether the individual outcomes were caused by the drug or by chance. Study volunteers who took Wegovy lost about 9 percent of their weight while the placebo group lost less than 1 percent. The Wegovy group also saw drops in key markers of heart disease, including inflammation, cholesterol, blood sugars, blood pressure and waist circumference, noted Dr. Martha Gulati, a heart expert at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.  Changes in those markers began early in the study, before participants lost much weight. 'It means to me that it's more than just weight loss, how this drug works,' said Gulati, who had no role in what she called a landmark study. Still, 'it remains unclear' how much of the results were a benefit of losing weight or the drug itself, an editorial accompanying the study noted. About a third of all study volunteers reported serious side effects. About 17 percent in the Wegovy group and about 8 percent in the comparison group left the study, mostly because of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and other stomach-related problems. Nearly three-quarters of participants were men and nearly 84 percent were white. Gulati and others said future research needs to include more women and racial and ethnic minorities. Wegovy is part of a new class of injectable medications for obesity. On Wednesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Eli Lilly's Zepbound, a version of the diabetes drug Mounjaro, for weight control. Both carry high price tags — monthly costs are about $1,300 for Wegovy and about $1,000 for Zepbound. And both have been in shortage for months, with manufacturers promising to boost supplies. Both contain the same key ingredient, semaglutide, which suppresses appetite and has been hailed a ‘game-changer’ for the resulting weight loss.  And both should be prescribed by a doctor but there are concerns about people accessing the drugs online through unregulated providers.  The medications are often not covered by private health insurance or subject to strict preauthorization requirements. Medicare, the government health plan for older Americans, is prohibited from covering drugs for weight loss alone.  But drugmakers and obesity treatment advocates have been pushing for broader coverage, including asking Congress to pass legislation to mandate that Medicare pay for the drugs. Wegovy and Ozempic work by triggering the body to produce a hormone called GLP-1 that is released naturally from the intestines after meals Results from the latest study and others that show the obesity drugs have a direct effect on costly health problems could be a factor in shifting the calculus of coverage, said Dr. Mark McClellan, former chief of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the FDA. Dr Simon Cork, senior lecturer in physiology at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, said the findings highlight the importance of accessing these drugs through trusted medical professionals, with ongoing support and monitoring. He said: 'It is vital that regulation is tightened to ensure that these drugs are only prescribed under the right circumstances. 'Whilst the likelihood of developing these conditions is still rare, when scaled up to the numbers who could potentially be prescribed these drugs we could start to see many people experiencing adverse effects from their use.' Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Ozempic, was not involved in the analysis and did not have any approved GLP-1 products in 2006, which is the earliest point in the dataset. A spokesman said gastrointestinal events are 'well-known side effects of the GLP-1 class.' He said: ‘We recommend patients take these medications for their approved indications and under the supervision of a healthcare professional. ‘Treatment decisions should be made together with a healthcare provider who can evaluate the appropriateness of using a GLP-1 based on assessment of a patient's individual medical profile.' In August, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk were sued over claims their drugs caused stomach paralysis.  Personal injury firm Morgan & Morgan took on a case on behalf of a 44-year-old Louisiana woman with diabetes who lost weight while taking the drugs, only to suffer later from severe stomach paralysis marked by such violent vomiting that she lost some teeth and required multiple trips to the hospital. The suit against Eli Lilly, which makes another drug used for weight loss called Mounjaro, and Novo Nordisk alleged the companies failed to warn consumers about the risk of gastroparesis, or paralysis of the stomach. It adds to a growing list of side effects of the drugs. As well as losing pleasure in food, people have reported having 'no desire' in activities they used to enjoy, such as drinking alcohol and gambling, allowing some to kick long-standing habits. Emerging research shows patients who stop taking the injectables are vulnerable to regaining all lost weight and may be required to stay on the medication for an extended period of time.  The long-term effects of the drugs are still under investigation as the drugs are relatively new.

4,"Members of the 'PayPal Mafia' include tech titans like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Reid Hoffman. Here's where they are now.",Yahoo,2023-11-01,"""PayPal mafia"" members Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Reid Hoffman went from working at the startup in the early 2000s to ...",https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/members-paypal-mafia-tech-titans-094001560.html,"A group of early 2000s PayPal employees and founders came to be known as the ""PayPal Mafia."" The members have all gone on to impact Silicon Valley by founding and developing major companies. The group includes Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, and the founders of both YouTube and Yelp. What do the founders of YouTube, Yelp, Tesla, and LinkedIn have in common? Apart from creating some of the biggest companies in tech, they all share a common résumé line item: they've all worked at PayPal. Many of PayPal's early employees went on to become major names in tech and the venture capital world, founding, funding, and otherwise developing successful companies. This elite group came to be known as the ""PayPal Mafia,"" a nickname that gained popularity after Fortune featured the term in a 2007 piece along with a photo of some of the members dressed in gangster attire. Members of the group include Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Reid Hoffman, along with over a dozen others. Here's a rundown of the most prominent members of this exclusive group and what they're up to over two decades later. Peter Thiel: PayPal's founder and the so-called ""don"" of the PayPal Mafia Peter Thiel cofounded the company that would become Paypal — called Confinity — in 1999 alongside Max Levchin and Luke Nosek. Confinity was launched as a developer of security software for hand-held devices like the PalmPilot, but it later pivoted toward digital money transfers. Thiel served as CEO of PayPal until October 2002, when eBay acquired the company for $1.5 billion. Thiel's 3.7% stake was worth a $55 million, according to SEC filings. Thiel went on to cofound Founders Fund, a venture capital firm that has helped launch companies like SpaceX and Airbnb. Thiel, now a billionaire with a net worth of over $8 billion, according to Bloomberg, cofounded the big data analysis firm Palantir in 2003. He was the first major outside investor in Facebook and contributed early funding to Yelp and LinkedIn, along with a number of other ventures launched by his PayPal peers. Thiel's also a partner of Founders Fund, a venture capital fund based in San Francisco. Thiel has also drawn criticism in recent years for his support of President Donald Trump and for secretly funding Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media, which resulted in the company shutting down Gawker and selling the company's assets. While he's reportedly taken a break from trying to play political kingmaker, Insider recently reported that Thiel served as an FBI informant.   Max Levchin: PayPal cofounder and Chief Technology Officer. Max Levchin is sometimes called the ""consigliere"" of the PayPal Mafia — in ""The Godfather,"" a consigliere is an advisor to the boss. Levchin made significant contributions to PayPal's anti-fraud efforts. Together with PayPal technical architect David Gausebeck, he helped create the Gausebeck-Levchin test, an early version of a CAPTCHA for commercial applications. Levchin now serves as the CEO of Affirm. After PayPal was bought by eBay, Levchin founded a media-sharing service called Slide that was later bought by Google. He was also an early investor in Yelp — at one point he was the company's largest shareholder — and he served as chairman of Yelp from its founding in 2004 until July 2015. He founded fintech company Affirm, which allows consumers to finance online purchases at the point of sale and pay for them over time. Affirm went public in 2021, raising $1.2 billion in its IPO. Levchin is also the chairman of Glow, a fertility-tracking app that helps users improve their odds of conceiving. Ken Howery: PayPal cofounder and CFO from 1998 to 2002. After eBay bought PayPal, Howery stayed on as eBay's director of corporate development until 2003. After PayPal's acquisition, he served as cofounder and partner of Founders Fund alongside Peter Thiel. Howery recently served as US ambassador to Sweden. He was appointed by former President Trump in January 2019 and confirmed September of that year. Howery is active in several nonprofits and serves as a founding advisor to Kiva, an organization that facilitates loans to low-income entrepreneurs. Kiva was founded in part by Premal Shah, PayPal's former product manager. Howery is reportedly still good friends with Elon Musk. Elon Musk: founder of (the other) X.com, which merged with Thiel's Confinity to become PayPal In 1999, Elon Musk founded a payments company called X.com, which merged with Thiel's Confinity in 2000. He briefly served as CEO of PayPal before he was ousted by the board in September 2000 and replaced with Thiel. But as the company's largest shareholder, he still walked away from the PayPal sale to eBay with a cool $165 million. Musk is currently the world's richest person, per Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. Perhaps the most well known of all the members of the PayPal mafia now, Musk's estimated net worth is $209 billion. Since his PayPal days, Musk has moved on to oversee companies like Tesla, SpaceX, the Boring Company, and Neuralink. He's also bought Twitter and renamed it to X, after buying back the X.com domain name from PayPal.   Luke Nosek: PayPal cofounder and vice president of marketing and strategy. Nosek was also reportedly the person who clued in Peter Thiel to cryogenic preservation, which Thiel has since invested in heavily. Nosek explored angel investing. In 2005, Nosek joined Thiel and Howery as a partner at Founders Fund. In 2017, Nosek left Founders Fund to launch investment firm Gigafund, which helped raise money for SpaceX. Nosek invested in Musk's SpaceX and was also named a board member. He also joined the board of ResearchGate, a platform where scientists and researchers can ask questions, follow topics, and review one another's papers. Roelof Botha: PayPal's director of corporate development, vice-president of finance, CFO Botha went to school to be an actuary. He said he never planned to get into tech, but when he saw the opportunity in Silicon Valley, his intuition told him it was where he needed to be. He started as PayPal's director of corporate development, went on to become vice-president of finance, and later served as CFO. Botha is now a partner at venture capital firm Sequoia Capital Botha is now considered one of the top tech investors in the world. Sequoia Capital has has funded tech giants like Apple, Google, YouTube, and Instagram. Botha as served on the board at more than a dozen companies, including Square, EventBrite, and Weebly, 23andMe, Tumblr, Instagram, and YouTube. Reid Hoffman: board of directors at PayPal, COO LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman served on the board of directors when PayPal was founded. He eventually joined the company full-time as PayPal's COO. In a New York Times interview, Peter Thiel referred to Hoffman as PayPal's ""firefighter in chief,"" noting that there were many fires that needed putting out in the company's early days. When PayPal was acquired by eBay, Hoffman was the company's executive vice president. Hoffman cofounded LinkedIn and is one of Silicon Valley's most prolific angel investors. Hoffman was an early investor in Facebook, Flickr, Care.com, and many more. In 2017 he joined the board of Microsoft. Hoffman has coauthored several books on startups and professional development. He hosts the ""Masters of Scale"" podcast, on which he interviews founders about how they launched and scaled their companies, and is a partner at VC firm Greylock Partners. He was an early investor in OpenAI and used to serve on its board, and cofounded Inflection AI.   David Sacks: PayPal COO Like Hoffman, Sacks also served as COO at PayPal. Previously a management consultant for McKinsey & Company, David Sacks joined PayPal in 1999. After PayPal was bought by eBay, Sacks produced and financed the box office hit ""Thank You For Smoking,"" which would go on to be nominated for two Golden Globes. In 2006 he founded Geni.com, an online tool for building family trees.   Sacks went on to found several companies and become an angel investor. In 2016, Sacks was briefly interim CEO at Zenefits, an HR software firm that was plagued by scandal, including allowing unlicensed brokers to sell insurance to its customers. In 2017, Sacks cofounded the early-stage investment firm Craft Ventures. Sacks is a serial entrepreneur and investor, with angel investments in Airbnb, Postmates, Slack, and many more. He's also still a member of Elon Musk's inner circle. Jawed Karim, Chad Hurley, and Steve Chen met at PayPal during its early days. Karim and Chen were engineers, while Hurley was a web designer. In 2005, the trio launched the video-sharing platform YouTube. Karim uploaded the platform's very first video, ""Me at the zoo,"" an 18-second clip of Karim in front of the San Diego Zoo's elephant exhibit. It's been viewed over 292 million times. Today, Karim, Hurley, and Chen remain active entrepreneurs and investors with a hand in projects from finance to music. Karim launched venture fund YVentures in 2008, through which he invested in Palantir, Reddit, Eventbrite, and Airbnb. Hurley stepped down as CEO of YouTube in 2010. Since then, he's backed education startup Uptime and invested in several sports teams. Chen invested in actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt's musical collaboration platform HitRecord, which in February secured $6.4 million in Series A funding. Andrew McCormack: assistant to Peter Thiel at PayPal McCormack joined PayPal in 2001, working as an assistant to Peter Thiel as the company prepared for its IPO. In 2003, McCormack started a restaurant group in San Francisco. In 2008, he joined Thiel Capital and worked there for 5 years. McCormack went on to launch VC firm Valar Ventures McCormack partnered up with Thiel again in 2010 to found Valar Ventures, a venture capital fund. Valar Ventures has invested in technology startups well beyond Silicon Valley, including some in Europe and Canada. In August, Crunchbase reported the firm had closed on a $150 million funding round for a new venture capital fund, Valar Fund V. McCormack continues to serve as a managing partner of the firm.   Keith Rabois: PayPal's executive vice president Entrepreneur Keith Rabois served as PayPal's executive vice president from 2000 to 2002. He would go on to join his PayPal colleague Reid Hoffman at LinkedIn as its vice president for business and corporate development from 2005 to 2007. He was an early investor in startups like Square, where he spent two-and-a-half years as COO. Rabois joined Thiel, Howery, and Nosek as a partner at Founders Fund. Rabois serves as CEO at OpenStore and is a general partner at Founder's Fund. He's also served on the board of directors for Yelp, Xoom, and Reddit. Russel Simmons and Jeremy Stoppelman: worked on technology at PayPal. Simmons was an engineer and Stoppelman was the vice president of technology after joining PayPal from X.com. In 2004, the pair came up with the idea for a platform where users could leave recommendations about businesses in their area. They pitched the idea to Levchin, who provided an early investment of $1 million, and Yelp was born. Simmons left his official role at Yelp in 2010, while Stoppelman continues to serve as Yelp's CEO. Simmons served as CTO at Yelp from 2004 until he left the role in 2010. Stoppelman is still CEO of Yelp, and has publicly spoken out in support of political issues like women's reproductive rights. Jack Selby: PayPal's vice president of corporate and international development. After leaving PayPal, Selby partnered with Thiel to start Clarium Capital Management. In 2017, Selby was revealed to be the generous tipper behind ""Tips for Jesus."" Selby later helped manage Thiel Capital, the Thiel's family office, and started his own venture capital fund, AZ-VC, where he serves as managing partner. He still serves as managing director at Thiel Capital. Starting in 2013, Selby began anonymously leaving tips for unsuspecting waitstaff, ranging into the thousands, and signing them ""Tips for Jesus."" His identity was confirmed by a New York City bartender who served him prior to receiving a $5,000 tip. Dave McClure: PayPal's director of marketing McClure served PayPal's director of marketing as for four years beginning in 2001. According to McClure's LinkedIn, he began a program called the PayPal Developer Network, which consisted of about 300,000 developers that were using PayPal. McClure left PayPal in 2004. He had a brief stint at Founders Fund before launching 500 Startups, an early stage venture fund. McClure stayed at 500 Startups until June 2017, when he was accused of ""inappropriate behavior with women"" in a New York Times report and stepped down from his role at the firm, writing an apology post titled ""I'm a creep. I'm sorry.""  He's since become an investor and owner in a professional sports league for ultimate frisbee and cofounded Practical Venture Capital, according to his LinkedIn.   Several more former PayPal employees went on to have careers both in and out of tech. Yishan Wong was an engineering manager who later served as CEO of Reddit from 2011 to 2014. Jason Portnoy worked in finance at PayPal, and went on to work at Clarium Capital and Palantir. He's now a partner at VC firm Oakhouse Partners. Premal Shah was a product manager at PayPal beginning in 2000, then went on to work at technology nonprofit Kiva. He's now president at financial-services startup Branch. David Gausebeck was a technical architect at PayPal. Now, he serves as chief scientist at 3D modeling company Matterport. Joe Lonsdale started his career as a finance intern at PayPal before moving into venture capital — he's worked at VC firms Clarium Capital, Formation 8, and 8VC. Lonsdale also cofounded Palantir. Eric Jackson was director of marketing at PayPal and went on to write a book about the company called ""The PayPal Wars."" He's currently the CEO of two companies, CapLinked and TransitNet.

5,Elliot Page Gets Fan Vote To Play Elon Musk In Upcoming Biopic,Yahoo,2023-10-24,"Tesla founder Elon Musk has a biopic on his life in the works at A24, and movie fans are already split on the concept of a ...",https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/elliot-page-gets-fan-vote-010009492.html,"Tesla founder Elon Musk has a biopic on his life in the works at A24, and movie fans are already split on the concept of a true-life project based on the South African-born billionaire. But many seem to love the idea of casting talented trans actor Elliot Page to play Musk in the biopic. While some think the two men bear a striking resemblance, others see it as a means to taunt Musk, who has a very controversial stance on trans rights and the LGBTQ+ community. Trending: Sarah Paulson’s Partner Reveals Reason Behind Long-Lasting Romance Despite Age Gap Cast Of ‘Star Wars’ Series ‘Ahsoka’ Finally Reveals Behind-The-Scenes Photos, Videos Netizens Say Joe Biden ‘Needs To Resign’ Following ‘Pathetic’ Veterans Day Moment ‘Keith Lee Effect’: TikTok Star Saves Las Vegas Burger Place From Closing Kris Jenner Approves of Timothee Chalamet & Kylie’s Romance With THIS Sweet Gesture! According to multiple reports, an Elon Musk biopic is currently in development at A24, and ""The Whale"" director Darren Aronofsky is set to helm the film project. Variety reports that Walter Isaacson’s authorized biography of Musk, which was released in September, will serve as the foundation for the biopic. Sources revealed to the news outlet that there was a heated competition over the adaptation rights to Isaacson's book by various filmmakers and studios, with A24 eventually winning. Following news of the upcoming project, Musk acknowledged it on his app X, formerly known as Twitter, stating how happy he is that Aronofsky will serve as director. He wrote, ""Glad Darren is doing it. He is one of the best."" Besides his Oscar award-winning film, ""The Whale,"" Aronofsky has directed other successful projects like ""Black Swan"" starring Natalie Portman and ""Mother!"" starring Jennifer Lawrence. He is known for his surreal approach to filmmaking, which tends to include psychological themes. With the news of the upcoming Musk-related film project comes the question of who should play the controversial tech mogul.  At the moment, and as far as X netizens are concerned, there's only one person qualified for that position, and it's trans actor Elliot Page.  After a huge film account on the social media platform asked who should be cast as Musk, a user replied, ""Elliot Page."" The tweet has received nearly 50,000 likes and has over 1.6 million views. It also drew the attention of several people who agreed that Page should star as Musk. One user noted a similarity between the pair, saying, ""Oh s---! I can actually see that- that’d be great casting! Another person wrote, ""F---.....i know this is meant as a bit but Elliot could actually pull that off. Been a bit since he did comedy too and there would be some good comedy bits in there too."" Oh shit! I can actually see that- that’d be great casting! pic.twitter.com/6moLeQ1fKu — Petirep (@Petirep) November 10, 2023 ""Honestly, has the right bodytype for a young musk and is an incredible performer. Would absolutely do a banging job. Really like the idea,"" a third X user commented. ""Sure the irony of such a casting would be amazing, but you just know Elliot would crush the role too,"" a fourth person stated. Although many were in agreement that Page should play Musk, others felt the actor was too ""likeable"" to portray the Starlink owner. One comment read, ""If it was a satire, sure. But Elliot is a fantastic actor and if the bio is a puff piece he would absolutely make Muskrat more relatable, simply because Elliot is good at his job."" Page is known for his starring roles in movies such as ""Inception,"" ""Juno,"" ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" and many more. He also currently stars in the hit Netflix series, ""The Umbrella Academy"" as Viktor Hargreeves. The trans activist is an Academy Award and a two Primetime Emmy Award nominee, so his acting skills are undeniable. Over the years, Musk has fallen out with the LGBTQ+ community due to his controversial stance on issues relating to them, especially transgender people. Musk has been caught on several occasions liking comments on his app that many consider to be transphobic and has also made some offensive remarks himself. The X owner once stated that the word ""cis"" is no longer allowed on the platform and then recently tweeted that it is a slur. Musk said, ""The word 'cis' is a heterosexual slur. Shame on anyone who uses it."" His comment was met with criticism, with many pointing out that the terms ""cis"" and ""cisgender"" are used to simply describe people whose gender identity fits their assigned sex at birth. Musk also notably has a fractured relationship with his transgender daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson, which he claimed in his biography that he tried to fix to no avail. Film production company A24 and director Darren Aronofsky are making an Elon Musk biopic. The film will be based on Walter Isaacson’s biography. In many ways, the results of Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter has actually been fairly predictable, even if his erratic decisions have played out in unexpected ways.

6,"Excited for the Tesla Cybertruck? You better be, because Elon Musk’s EV maker could demand $50K if you resell it sans permission in year one",Fortune,2023-09-18,Tesla CEO Elon Musk doesn't want Cybertruck customers to resell the unusual electric vehicle in the first year. FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images Typically once you purchase a vehicle and it is ...,https://fortune.com/2023/11/12/tesla-cybertruck-cant-be-resold-first-year-sans-permission-elon-musk-electric-vehicles/?itm_source=parsely-api,"Typically once you purchase a vehicle and it is yours, nothing can stop you from selling it to someone else. But that’s not the case for the Tesla Cybertruck. A section entitled “For Cybertruck Only” in Tesla’s Motor Vehicle Order Terms begins: “You understand and acknowledge that the Cybertruck will first be released in limited quantity. You agree that you will not sell or otherwise attempt to sell the Vehicle within the first year following your Vehicle’s delivery date.” Of course, many enthusiastic buyers of the stainless steel electric Cybertruck, some of whom will soon receive their vehicle, won’t care about this provision, which Insider surfaced, at all. And if for whatever reason they do need to resell it, there’s a proper way to go about it, according to the terms: “If you must sell the Vehicle within the first year following its delivery date for any unforeseen reason, and Tesla agrees that your reason warrants an exception to its no reseller policy, you agree to notify Tesla in writing and give Tesla reasonable time to purchase the Vehicle from you at its sole discretion and at the purchase price listed on your Final Price Sheet less $0.25/mile driven, reasonable wear and tear, and the cost to repair the Vehicle to Tesla’s Used Vehicle Cosmetic and Mechanical Standards. If Tesla declines to purchase your Vehicle, you may then resell your Vehicle to a third party only after receiving written consent from Tesla.” So it might take some time-consuming back-and-forth, but it would be possible to get permission to resell the vehicle. But if a Cybertruck owner overlooks or simply forgets about these terms, watch out: Penalties could ensue. “You agree that in the event you breach this provision, or Tesla has reasonable belief that you are about to breach this provision, Tesla may seek injunctive relief to prevent the transfer of title of the Vehicle or demand liquidated damages from you in the amount of $50,000 or the value received as consideration for the sale or transfer, whichever is greater.” If that weren’t enough to discourage someone from selling in the first year sans permission, there’s another threat to consider: “Tesla may also refuse to sell you any future vehicles.” There’s no shortage of interest in the unusual pickup. Elon Musk, Tesla’s video-game-loving CEO and world’s richest man, said last month that over 1 million customers have made deposits for the Cybertruck. The company’s capacity to make it, by contrast, now stands at only about 125,000 per year. It hopes to reach 250,000 by 2025. © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

The singer’s lawyer reportedly filed a supplemental proof of service document in a California court earlier this month, which revealed that in one week alone, four different process servers tried to deliver custody papers to Musk at multiple locations. These included X’s headquarters in San Francisco, Tesla’s Gigafactory Texas, and SpaceX’s launch site in Boca Chica, Texas. The court documents state that the process servers - people who deliver legal documents to defendants -were only able to serve the documents via substituted service, also known as leaving the papers with someone else at a person’s home or business rather than the person themself. One process server tracked his private jets between 13 to 17 October to find the perfect moment to serve him, reporting in the documents that the billionaire “Utilizes his aircraft to such an extent that his travel on his owned aircraft has been likened to a rideshare, such as Uber.” Attorney Christopher Melcher defended the process server’s tactics to the outlet, saying: “Typically we don’t have any knowledge of the comings and goings of these people, so it’s reasonable to knock on their door or go to their place of business.” Elon Musk and Grimes attend the Heavenly Bodies: Fashion & The Catholic Imagination Costume Institute Gala at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 7, 2018 in New York City The process server explained that they were able to track the Tesla CEO’s private jets through websites, like FlightAware, which receive their data via the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  The billionaire has reportedly used the FAA feature, the“Limited Aircraft Data Displayed” (LADD) program, to conceal his flight data from the public.  Musk isn’t the only prominent figure on the LADD list, with the likes of Jeff Bezos and Taylor Swift also going to great lengths to cloak their travel patterns. He’s also used PIA - the privacy ICAO aircraft address program - another FAA feature that hides private jet travel but reportedly stopped using the programme in December.  People trying to track the movements of jets circumvent programmes like the LADD list through sites like the ADS-B Exchange, a public flight-tracking database that collects data from a network of volunteer-run radios. They can also use feeders, which transmit data from ADS-B-equipped aircraft. According to the process server, they were also able to track Musk via “crowdsourced data, collected from radio signals transmitted from aircraft.” On 16 October, they admitted to also setting up “surveillance positions” near hangars and along the runway at an airport in Hawthorne, California.  Grimes’s team was ultimately satisfied with serving the billionaire through his security at X headquarters. The musician - whose legal name is Claire Boucher - is suing Musk for physical custody of their three children, two sons X Æ A-XII and Techno Mechanicus, and one daughter, Exa Dark Sideræl.  The SpaceX founder also shares 18-month-old twins, Strider and Azure, with Neuralink executive Shivon Zillis, 37. He also fathered 19-year-old twins, Vivian Jenna Wilson and Griffin, along with triplets Kai, Damian, and Sax, with his first wife, Justine Wilson. The triplets were born in 2006, while the twins were born in 2004.

The facility had a worker-injury rate six times the space-industry average in 2022. REUTERS/Go Nakamura Reuters documented at least 600 previously unreported workplace injuries at Muskâs rocket company: crushed limbs, amputations, electrocutions, head and eye wounds and one death. SpaceX employees say theyâre paying the price for the billionaireâs push to colonize space at breakneck speed. By MARISA TAYLOR Filed Nov. 10, 2023, 11 a.m. GMT One windy night at Elon Muskâs SpaceX facility in McGregor, Texas, Lonnie LeBlanc and his co-workers realized they had a problem. They needed to transport foam insulation to the rocket companyâs main hangar but had no straps to secure the cargo. LeBlanc, a relatively new employee, offeredÂ a solution to hold down the load: He sat on it. After the truck drove away, a gust blew LeBlanc and the insulation off the trailer, slamming him headfirst into the pavement. LeBlanc, 38, had retired nine monthsÂ earlier from the U.S. Marine Corps. He was pronounced dead from head trauma at the scene. Federal inspectors with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) later determinedÂ that SpaceX had failed to protect LeBlanc from a clear hazard, noting the gravity and severity of the violation.Â LeBlancâs co-workers told OSHA that SpaceX had no convenient access to tie-downs and no process or oversight for handling such loads. SpaceX acknowledged the problems, and the agency instructed the company to make seven specific safety improvements, including more training and equipment, according to the inspection report. It was hardly the last serious accident at SpaceX. Since LeBlancâs death in June 2014, which hasnât been previously reported, Muskâs rocket company has disregarded worker-safety regulations and standard practices at its inherently dangerous rocket and satellite facilitiesÂ nationwide, with workers paying a heavy price, a Reuters investigation found. Through interviews and government records, the news organization documented at least 600 injuries of SpaceX workers since 2014. Many were serious or disabling. The records included reports of more than 100 workers suffering cuts or lacerations, 29 with broken bones or dislocations, 17 whose hands or fingers were âcrushed,â and nine with head injuries, including one skull fracture, four concussions and one traumatic brain injury. The cases also included five burns, five electrocutions, eight accidents that led to amputations,Â 12 injuries involving multiple unspecified body parts, and seven workers with eye injuries. Others were relatively minor, including more than 170 reports of strains or sprains. Current and former employees said such injuries reflect a chaotic workplace where often under-trained and overtired staff routinely skipped basic safety procedures as they raced to meet Muskâs aggressive deadlines for space missions. SpaceX, founded by Musk more than two decades ago, takes the stance that workers are responsible for protecting themselves, according to more than a dozen current and former employees, including a former senior executive. Musk himself at times appeared cavalier about safety on visits to SpaceX sites: Four employees said he sometimes played with a novelty flamethrower and discouraged workers from wearing safety yellowÂ because he dislikes bright colors. The lax safety culture, more than a dozen current and formerÂ employees said, stems in part from Muskâs disdain for perceived bureaucracy and a belief inside SpaceX that itâs leading an urgent quest to create a refuge in space from a dying Earth. âElonâs concept that SpaceX is on this mission to go to Mars as fast as possible and save humanity permeates every part of the company,â said Tom Moline, a former SpaceX senior avionics engineer who was among a group of employees fired after raising workplace complaints. âThe company justifies casting aside anything that could stand in the way of accomplishing that goal, including worker safety.â One severe injury in January 2022 resulted from a series of safety failures that illustrate systemic problems at SpaceX, according to eight formerÂ SpaceX employees familiar with the accident. In that case, a part flew off during pressure testing of a Raptor V2 rocket engine â fracturing the skull of employee Francisco Cabada and putting him in a coma. The sources told Reuters that senior managers at the Hawthorne, California site were repeatedly warned about the dangers of rushing the engineâs development, along with inadequate training of staff and testing of components. The part that failed and struck the worker had a flaw that was discovered, but not fixed, before the testing, two of the employees said. Cabadaâs wife told Reuters the company has ignored the familyâs attempts to find out why he wasnât protected.Â âIt would have been nice to get a call from Elon Musk,â Ydy Cabada said. âBut I guess workers are just disposable to them.â In all, Reuters interviewed more than three dozen people with knowledge of SpaceX safety practices, including more than two dozen current or former employees. Many of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity, citing concerns about career or legal repercussions. SpaceX did not respond to questions from Reuters and a detailed description of this articleâs findings. The more than 600 SpaceX injuries Reuters documentedÂ represent only a portion of the total case count, a figure that is not publicly available. OSHA has required companies to report their total number of injuries annually since 2016, but SpaceX facilities failed to submit reports for most of those years. About two-thirds of the injuries Reuters uncovered came in years when SpaceX did not report that annual data, which OSHA collects to help prioritize on-site inspections of potentially dangerous workplaces. âElonâs concept that SpaceX is on this mission to go to Mars as fast as possible and save humanity permeates every part of the company. The company justifies casting aside anything that could stand in the way of accomplishing that goal, including worker safety.â Reuters unearthed details about the 600-plus injuries by examining court documents in worker lawsuits, employee medical records, state workersâ compensation claims and emergency-call records. The news agency also obtained, through public records requests, internal SpaceX injury logs that the company turned over to federal and stateÂ safety inspectors following serious safety incidents. Such logs are rarely made public. Regulators require companies to keep the records, which include descriptions of individual injuries, and to produce them upon request. After years of failing to report annual injury-and-illness statistics to regulators, some SpaceX sites started filing the data in 2021 or 2022. The data for 2022, which are more complete, reveal injury rates at three major SpaceX industrial facilities that far exceeded the space-industry average. SpaceX injury data reporting failures SpaceX facilities failed to submit injury data annually, as required by regulators, for most years since 2016.Â When they did report, three major sitesâ injury rates far exceeded industry averages. The average was 0.8 injuries per 100 workers for 2022Â and has been relatively stable for many years. The 2022 injury rate at the companyâs manufacturing-and-launch facility near Brownsville, Texas, was 4.8 injuries or illnesses per 100 workers â six times higher than the space-industry average of 0.8. Its rocket-testing facility in McGregor, Texas, where LeBlanc died, had a rate of 2.7, more than three times the average. The rate at its Hawthorne, California, manufacturing facility was more than double the average at 1.8 injuries per 100 workers. The companyâs facility in Redmond, Washington, had a rate of 0.8, the same as the industry average. Two other SpaceX facilities in Florida, at Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral, could not be compared to the industry average in 2022. Kennedy didnât report injury data that year. And the company labeled Cape Canaveral as part of a different industry subcategory for which the government doesnât calculate an average rate. The Kennedy site did report injury data for 2016, the first year it was required to do so â but hasnât reported since. For that year, the facility reported data amounting to an injury rate of 21.5 injuries per 100 workers, about 27 times the industry average. The facility employed only 50 people at the time; it had just taken over a launch pad from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Sixteen of those workers were injured, SpaceX reported. By 2021, employment at Kennedy had grown to more than 1,100 workers, NASA said. (See related story on how Reuters analyzed SpaceXâs safety record.) A dozen worker-safety experts said SpaceXâs poor safety record underscores the perils of working in the lightly regulated and fast-expanding U.S. space industry. Other major space companies have also failed to report annual injury data to OSHA in some recent years. Reuters reviewed state and federal safety violation recordsÂ on SpaceX and found no sanctions for its data-reporting failures. For safetyÂ violations that inspectors found after SpaceX worker accidents, state and federal regulators levied only small fines, typically ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. In a written response to questions from Reuters, OSHA did not comment on SpaceXâs worker safety record or its enforcement decisions involving the company. The agency did not address why it never cited SpaceX for failing to report injury data for many years, saying it would be âunfair to draw a conclusionâ because it didnât know âthe specifics.â Reuters documented the safety reporting lapses using the agencyâs own records. The agency did say it has recently increased inspections of companies generally and issued more of its stiffest penalties in egregious cases. California OSHA, a state-run workplace safety regulator, did not comment in response to Reutersâ questions. Current and former employees said SpaceXâs high injury rates reflect a chaotic workplace where often under-trained and overtired staff routinely skipped basic safety procedures as they raced to meet Muskâs aggressive deadlines for space missions. NASA said it has paid SpaceX $11.8 billion to date as a private space contractor. The agency did not comment on the companyâs safety record but said it has the option of enforcing contract provisions that require SpaceX to âhave a robust and effective safety program and culture.â SpaceX has defended its safety practices in written responses to OSHA and CalOSHA. In response to an inquiry into the Cabada accident, SpaceX argued to CalOSHA that it shouldnât be held responsible for such injuries because it provides extensive safety training and the malfunction was not reasonably foreseeable. Accountability for such part failures and any resulting injuries falls instead on a cadre of employees known as âresponsible engineers,â or REs, the company wrote. âREs are ultimately responsible for all aspects of their components and systems,â including safety, the company wrote.Â âPut simply, the RE is the delegated SpaceX representative.â Safety specialists dismissed SpaceXâs contention that it can off-load the companyâs duty to ensure worker safety to specific engineers it employs. Jordan Barab, who served as an OSHA deputy assistant secretary between 2009 and 2017, called the notion âludicrous.â OSHA told Reuters that employers, not designated employees, are responsible for ensuring a hazard-free workplace. Travis Carson, a former Brownsville welder and productionÂ supervisor, said SpaceX generally left staffers in charge of their own safety, with little training or oversight. âSpaceXâs idea of safety is: âWeâll let you decide whatâs safe for you,â which really means there was no accountability,â said Carson, who has worked for more than two decades in dangerous jobs such as building submarines. âThatâs a terrible approach to take in industrial environments.â âNo accountabilityâ Since Musk co-founded SpaceX in 2002, his free-wheeling entrepreneurism has proved a powerful draw for young skilled workers. Some SpaceX employees described eagerly joining the company as it outpaced competitors and offered perks including in-house medical clinics and private company stock that has shot up in value. The company, which employs 13,000 workers, had an estimated value of $150 billion as of earlier this year. Musk has a 42% stake and 79% of the companyâs voting power, according to a company filing. SpaceX has achieved major breakthroughs. It was the first private company to send humans into orbit. Its Starlink unit is now the worldâs largest satellite operator. Competitors including Jeff Bezosâ Blue OriginÂ have struggled to keep pace with SpaceXâs reusable rockets, which have slashed launch costs. Some SpaceX engineers say they relish collaborating with creative coworkers in an environment with little bureaucracy. âThereâs a certain amount of red tape that SpaceX avoids, which allows it to move fasterâ than NASA or private competitors, said Chris Cunnington, a former engineer in McGregor, Texas. He said he believed SpaceX struck a good balance between speed and safety. Other current and former employees at the companyâs Brownsville site, which had the highest 2022 injury rate, said the companyâs disdain for structured processes came at a high cost to workers. SpaceX started building its Brownsville site in 2014, and it has since become the epicenter of Muskâs Mars mission. The facility employs more than 1,600 workers on the Texas-Mexico border and combines manufacturing, testing and launching. Itâs the base of SpaceXâs Starship program, a project aiming to build cheaper rockets faster. Brownsville managers, many of them in their 20s, worked grueling hours trying to meet Muskâs deadlines, according to six current or formerÂ employees familiar with the siteâs operations, including Moline and Carson. Some workers slept overnight at the facility at times so they could work more than 80 hours a week, according to four of those employees. Carson worked at the Brownsville site as a welder in 2019 and 2020 and returned as a production supervisor in 2021 and 2022. He said some employees took Adderall, the stimulant typically used to treat attention-deficit disorder, without a prescription. Others fell asleep in bathrooms, said Carson and three other current or former Brownsville workers. To speed work and cut costs, SpaceX started manufacturing rockets in tents next to an undeveloped Gulf of Mexico beach. Workers welded rocket parts up to 12 hours a day, six days a week, often in temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the SpaceX workers said. When overcome by heat, they were given IV fluids and sent back to work. When high winds disrupted the work, supervisors shut the tents, closing off ventilation that is essential for safe welding, according to the six current and former workers. OSHA warns that welding stainless steel can generate a highly toxic, cancer-causing dust. The agency told Reuters it requires companies to assess the danger of such environments through air sampling and to implement a ârespiratory protection programâ when needed. One former welder, Phillip Fruge, said he asked managers for respirators commonly used to protect weldersâ lungs, but they werenât provided. âWe could see the clouds of the dust filling the tent,â Fruge recalled. âEveryone was just breathing it in, day after day.â Carson said he pressed superiors for better safety measures but was ignored. He recalled stepping into the interior of a rocket under construction in 2021 on his first day as a supervisor. Another manager, working 20 feet above him, carelessly dropped a nearly 100-pound hoist, barely missing Carson. âThatâs like a firing offense at other places, but not at SpaceX,â Carson said. âThey needed bodies, and Elon needed stuff done.â Carson himself eventually was fired in January 2022 after getting into a scuffle with a boss. Carson, who is African American, said he shoved the manager, a younger man, because he had repeatedly called Carson âboy,â despite Carsonâs requests that he stop. âBoyâ is widely considered a racial epithet by Americans when used to refer to a Black man. The supervisor, who could not be reached for comment, was not disciplined, according to Carson. Reuters could not independently confirm how SpaceX handled the incident. SpaceX sometimes rushed to hire workers and regularly failed to properly train or equip new recruits, more than a dozen current and former employees said. Workers with no experience, for instance,Â were handed welding tools without training, they said. Four of these employees, who were managers fresh out of college, described making tough calls on the safety of dangerous activities with little guidance. In November 2021, two Brownsville technicians were moving square steel tubing weighing 500 pounds, using a crane with a lifting magnet, according to OSHA inspection records. The tubing fell and crushed a workerâs hand because the crane was only designed to hoist 300 pounds, OSHA concluded. The employee, whose name was redacted in the inspection report the agency gave Reuters, required long-term treatment after surgery, including the partial amputation of the workerâs ring finger, according to the report. The agency faulted the company for failing to ensure employees tested whether the crane could lift the load.Â SpaceX appealed the resulting $43,506 fine and got it knocked down to $8,701 after agreeing to remedy the worker-safety problems identified in the report. Florentino Rios suffered a severe eye injury at SpaceXâs Brownsville site one summer night in 2021, as he worked about 25 feet off the ground attaching two beams to a launch pad. A crane operator missed a hand signal from Rios and mistakenly tried to move the beams after they were fixed in place, Rios said in an interview. That error caused a chain connecting the crane to the beams to snap and strike Rios in the face. Another worker who was present confirmed Riosâ account. The team should have had walkie-talkies, Rios said, and had previously asked management for better lighting. As blood trickled down his face, Rios inched along a beam to a platform where he was lowered down, he said. SpaceX employees who examined him at an on-site medical clinic told him he could return to work on the next shift, although he still couldnât see well, said his attorney, Richard Hinojosa. Reuters could not independently confirm the SpaceX medical clinicâs assessment. Rios went to the hospital that night. A medical scan revealed a traumatic injury in his swollen left eye, according to medical and workersâ compensation records reviewed by Reuters.Â He continued to work anyway for a few days.Â When he sought further treatment, doctors told him he had lost vision in the eye and was legally blind, the records show. Rios, 55, said he can no longer drive or work construction. He sued SpaceX alleging its negligence caused the injury by failing to implement or follow worker-safety procedures. âIt wasnât safe,â Rios said, adding that management never addressed the problems. The company, in court records, argued that Riosâ own negligence was to blame. The case is ongoing. âI used to be someone who didnât like sitting around,â said Rios. âI worked day and night to give my children what they needed. And now, I canât.â Shortcutting safety On Jan. 18 of last year, part of a Raptor V2 engine broke away during pressure testing at the SpaceX facility in Hawthorne, California. The part, a fuel-controller assembly cover, careened into the head of Cabada, a SpaceX technician. Nearly two years later, the father of three young children remains in a coma with a hole in his skull, family members said. The accident generated news last year but little has emerged until now about the causes. The incident stemmed from several safety lapses at the Hawthorne site, according to Reuters interviews with eight former SpaceX employees familiar with the incident and the testing preparations. Two of the employees said the mishap resulted in part from a simple mistake: An engineer started the test when Cabada was still too close to the engine and unprotected from explosions or flying debris. Senior managers were repeatedly warned for at least a year before the accident that pressure-testing crews were not following standard worker-safety protocols, such as providing protective barriers or clearing personnel from the testing area, according to a former employeeÂ familiar with the matter. Such testing should be conducted with a âboom boxâ covering the whole engine to protect workers, the employee said.Â At one point, managers rejected a new training program, written and proposed by pressure-testing staff, on the grounds that it would cause delays, according to the source and a document reviewed by Reuters. Another key contributing factor: SpaceX senior managers, in the months leading up to the accident, had instructed engineers to end or limit the testing of individual rocket parts before they are assembled into an engine, two staffers said. The managers were reacting to Muskâs demands forÂ faster progress on the Raptor engine program, the workers said. The team normally would have conducted more extensive testing on the cover that malfunctioned and struck Cabada, they said. The limited testing nonetheless revealed a potentially dangerous flaw in the cover, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The component was redesigned to correct the problem, they said, but the new part wasnât ready before the pressure testing that hurt Cabada. Reuters could not determine the precise nature of the flaw. SpaceXâs rejection of a more rigorous training program, its moves to limit testing, and the discovery of the coverâs defect before the accident havenât been previously reported. Related content Tesla created secret team to suppress thousands of driving range complaints Tesla workers shared sensitive images recorded by customer cars Muskâs Neuralink faces federal probe, employee backlash over animal tests In a written response to CalOSHAâs inspection, SpaceX said it had conducted ample analysis and testing of the part before it failed. More than a dozen current and former workers said SpaceXâs willingness to cut corners and skip some worker safeguards has helped keep it well ahead of competitors and score lucrative government contracts. SpaceX last year surpassed Boeing to become NASAâs second-largest vendor. The company also boosts development speed through a structure that gives managers high levels of autonomy but raises safety risks, the dozen current and former SpaceX workers said. The company is split into three teams: engineering, manufacturing, and testing. The engineering leadership includes the âresponsible engineersâ SpaceX designates as accountable for safety in manufacturing.Â But those engineers have little control of other teams, including the one that stress-tests the engines and parts they develop, according to two staffers with knowledge of the matter. In the case of the test that injured Cabada, this loose structure meant the testing team never coordinated with the responsible engineer team, the workers said. After the Cabada accident, CalOSHAÂ inspectors detailed other safety lapses. One employee involved in the pressure checks told them that the company generally didnât do full safety inspections before such testing, agency records show. Another said the engine should have undergone more testing âwithout personnel around,â according to the records. SpaceX pushed back on the agencyâs findingÂ that the company failed to protect Cabada, the records show. The company blamed a particular responsible engineer, who it said was accountable for the safety of the defective cover âthrough the lifecycle of development, testing and production.â SpaceX fired the engineer and a manager on the same team over the incident, according toÂ three employees with knowledge of the situation. Cabadaâs wife, Ydy,Â said SpaceX hasnât responded to the familyâs attempts to find out how he was injured. Michael Sanchez, a Los Angeles attorney representing her, said the company has never answered his inquiries, including a March 2022 certified letter requesting a copy of any surveillance footage of the accident and advising SpaceX to preserve any other relevant records. Ydy Cabada has considered a lawsuit but has not filed one. âSpaceX has not returned a single call,â Sanchez said. Franciscoâs sister, Evelyn Cabada, said the accident devastated the family.Â In addition to the severe head injury, she said, her brother caught pneumonia and meningitis in the hospital. Ydy Cabada said the family still holds out hope heâll emerge from the coma. âThe doctors keep saying nothing has changed,â she said. âItâll take a miracle for him to get out of that bed.â Flamethrowers and safety yellow Musk is well-known as a hands-on manager. He was directly involved in handing down sometimes unrealistic deadlines, said current and former employees. Muskâs heavy involvement in scheduling resulted in âsignificantly more unsafe working conditions than would have existed otherwise,â said Moline, the engineer. One former SpaceX executive defended Musk, saying he would listen to employees who were willing to go âtoe-to-toeâ with him on safety issues and took them seriously. Another former executive said Musk cared about his workers and was bothered when they got hurt, but that safety was not one of Muskâs priorities. Musk, the ex-manager said, thought that âworkers take care of their safety themselves.â This former executive said that top company officials knew its injury rates ran high but attributed the problem to employing a largely youngÂ workforce in a dangerous industry. SpaceX leaders also believed the company shouldnât be held to the same standard as competitors because SpaceX oversees more missions and manufacturing, the two former executives said. That attitude is a red flag that a company is rationalizing a fundamentally unsafe environment, according to four worker-safety experts interviewed by Reuters, including Barab, the former OSHA deputy assistant secretary. âSpaceX shouldnât be exempt from protecting workers from being injured or killed,â Barab said, âjust because theyâre doing innovative work.â Four SpaceX employees told Reuters they were disturbed by Muskâs habit of playing with a flamethrower when he visited the SpaceX site in Hawthorne. The device was marketed to the publicÂ in 2018 as a $500 novelty item by Muskâs tunnel-building firm, the Boring Company. Videos posted online show it can shoot a thick flame more than five feet long. Boring later renamed the device the âNot-A-Flamethrowerâ amid reports of confiscations by authorities. For years, Musk and his deputies found it âhilariousâ to wave the flamethrower around, firing it near other people and giggling âlike they were in middle school,â one engineer said. Musk tweeted in 2018 that the flamethrower was âguaranteed to liven up any party!â At SpaceX, Musk played with the device in close-quarters office settings, said the engineer, who at one point feared Musk would set someoneâs hairÂ on fire. Musk also became known in California and TexasÂ for ordering machinery that was painted in industrial safety yellow toÂ be repainted black or blue because of his aversion to bright colors, according to three former SpaceX supervisors. Managers also sometimes told workers to avoid wearing safety-yellow vests around Musk, or to replace yellow safety tape with red, the supervisors said. Workers often walked too close to engine-testing and rocket-building facilities because the company failed to cordon off areas or put upÂ warning signs, said Paige Holland-Thielen, a former operations and automationÂ engineer in Hawthorne. âOne time I walked out the door of my building, and there was a giant crane there,â she recalled. âA bunch of people in hard hats started screaming at me to get back inside.â Holland-Thielen and Moline, who also worked in Hawthorne, were among nine workers fired in the summer of 2022 after raising workplace complaints in an open letter that was ultimately signed by hundreds of employees. The letter criticized Muskâs flippant social-media responses to sexual-harassment allegations against him, which he denied. It also criticized a management culture of dismissing employee concerns and unevenly enforcing discipline policies. Eight workers who drafted the letter have since filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board against SpaceX alleging unfair labor practices. Moline said SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell told him he was being fired for distracting workers from getting to Mars. âPlease focus on your job and the mission of SpaceX â to get humanity to Mars as quickly as possible,â Shotwell told him and Holland-Thielen, among others, in an email reviewed by Reuters. Shotwell did not respond to a request for comment. A death and a $7,000 fine SpaceX has faced few consequences from safety regulators for its failure to report annual safety data and to protect workers in incidents reviewed by federal and state inspectors, agency records show. OSHA and CalOSHAÂ have fined the billionaireâs rocket company a total ofÂ $50,836Â for violations stemming from one workerâs death and seven serious safety incidents, regulatory records show. OSHA did not comment on the modest penalties that resulted from inspections of SpaceX. SpaceXâs history of injuries and regulatory run-ins in California underscores the limits of worker-safety regulation. Fines are capped by law and pose little deterrent for major companies,Â experts in U.S. worker safety regulation said. Federal and state regulators also suffer from chronic understaffing of inspectors, they said. OSHA did not address questions about staffing levels but said it âfocuses its resources on hazardous workplaces.â CalOSHA levied a fine of $18,475 for the violation that resulted in Cabadaâs skull fracture. SpaceX unsuccessfully disputed the agencyâs classification of the violation as âseriousâ and appealed the penalty as excessive, asking for a reduction to $475. In another case, CalOSHA never inspected the company following a serious accident resulting in a leg amputation. But the agency may not have known the accident happened at all: A Reuters review of agency documents indicated it had no record of the 2016 incident. Federal and state law require companies to immediately report all employee deaths, amputations and injuries resulting in hospital admissions.Â It isnât clear whether SpaceX ever reported the injury. Neither the company nor CalOSHA commented on why the agency had no report on it. If SpaceX didnât report the case, âI donât think they have any excuse,â said Ann Rosenthal, a former OSHA associate solicitor, who handled legal matters for the agency until 2018. The incident resulted in Steven Trollingerâs leg being crushed during a mission to recover a rocket that landed in the Pacific Ocean, according to records in a lawsuit Trollinger filed. The accident occurred when he and other SpaceX employees were being transferred between two vessels. SpaceX knew that one of the vessels wasnât properly equipped with a transfer platform designed to ensure the workersâ safety, but proceeded anyway, Trollingerâs lawsuit alleges. Trollinger, who declined to comment, settled with SpaceX for an undisclosed sum, court records show. In inspections following two other serious California injuries â the amputation of two fingers in 2017 and a serious knee injury in 2021 â CalOSHA levied fines of $750 and $5,060, respectively. When a workerâs finger was amputated this March, inspectors took no action and did not visit the site, records show. After Texas worker Lonnie LeBlancÂ fell off a trailer and died in 2014, OSHA came to what it called an informal settlement with the company after inspectors found the safety lapses, OSHA records show. The settlement allowed SpaceX to pay a $7,000 fine. LeBlancâs brother, Chris Weimer, and an uncle, Ron Weimer, said the family didnât know that OSHA had investigated the death and found violations until Reuters told them. Ron Weimer said the hazardous nature of rocket-building is no excuse for his nephewâs death. âThereâs a way to do dangerous work,â he said, âwithout people dying.â Safety at SpaceX: How Reuters analyzed workplace injuries Reuters documented at least 600 injuries at SpaceX through a variety of public records, including the companyâs own injury logs at three facilities that were inspected by regulators. Such logs are normally kept private by companies, but they became public record when SpaceX was required to turn them over to inspectors from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and a state-run affiliate in California, CalOSHA. Reuters obtained these logs, which include short descriptions of each injury in a given year, through public records requests. They covered between one and five years at each of the three facilities, in Hawthorne, California; Cape Canaveral, Florida; and Redmond, Washington. Reuters also documented injuries through other public records and employee interviews at those three sites and three other facilities, in Brownsville, Texas; McGregor, Texas; and at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The records included court documents in worker lawsuits, employee medical records, state workersâ compensation claims, and emergency calls. SpaceX sites examined by Reuters The six total sites were chosen because they are SpaceXâs biggest industrial facilities, engaged in manufacturing, testing or rocket launching. Reuters also calculated annual injury rates for 2022 for some of these facilities using the annual data they have been required to file with OSHA since 2016. Reuters calculated the facilitiesâ rates using an OSHA formula that uses the total hours worked at a company to estimateÂ an annual injury rate per 100 full-time workers. The data used to calculate the SpaceX rates also included a small number of illnesses. Before 2021 and 2022, SpaceX facilities usually did not submit the required data, with each site failing to report it for between four and six years. When comparing these rates to the space-industry average, the news organization used an estimated average injury-and-illness rate produced annually by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS derives industry averages by collecting a representative sample of data from companies in a given industry; it cannot by law release data from individual firms surveyed. Like OSHA, the BLS is a division of the U.S. Labor Department, and both agencies collect injury data from companies under the same guidelines. OSHA advises companies to use the BLS average in their industry as a benchmark for their worker-safety performance. SpaceX, when filing injury data to the OSHA, classifies itself as part of the âguided missile and space vehicle manufacturingâ industry, a regulatory data-collection category that is a subset of the larger aerospace industry. The BLS estimated the average injury-and-illness rate for that industry was 0.8 per 100 workers in 2022, a rate that has not changed much in recent years. For one facility, in Cape Canaveral, SpaceX listed a different aerospace industry subcategory for 2022: âtransportation by spacecraft, freight.â That facility couldnât be compared to an industry average because the BLS doesnât produce one for that subcategory. Another facility, at Kennedy Space Center, did not report annual injury data to OSHA for 2022. reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives Got a confidential news tip?

 Benzinga - by Shanthi Rexaline, Benzinga Editor. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk can’t get over the fact that investment guru Warren Buffett has overlooked the electric vehicle pioneer’s stock as an investment option. What Happened: On Saturday, George Mack, an X platform user, raved about Buffett’s investment acumen by sharing an anecdote involving the billionaire investor. Mack noted that, during a talk in 2001, Buffett had asked students at the University of Georgia two questions that would help them better understand the character traits they should adopt and avoid. Mack pointed out that Buffett had asked the students which of their friends they would invest in and get 10% of their income for life. Buffett then asked them which of their friends they would pick if they could short their friends’ earnings. The takeaway from those two questions, as Mack said in his post, was that the former group of friends had character traits that should be adopted while the latter group possessed traits that should be avoided. Mack also made the point that Buffett’s thought experiment could be applied not only to money but also to finding happiness and more. Replying to Mack’s post, Musk said, “Too bad he didn't invest in Tesla when it was 0.1% of today's value lol.”  — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 12, 2023  Why It’s Important:  In February 2022, Musk said that, when he and Charlie Munger met over lunch in 2009, he encouraged Buffett’s trusted lieutenant to invest in the EV maker. Instead, Munger allegedly discussed all the ways the company would fail. Musk’s comments came after a social media user had asked stock ideas for investing in Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.’s (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) cash hoard, which was at over $128 billion at that time. The world’s richest man, in response, said, “Starting with T….” Buffett and Munger’s stance toward Musk has since softened. At Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in May 2023, the two praised Musk as talented and brilliant.  Previously, Future Fund’s Gary Black shared that Tesla did not fit into Buffett’s investment strategy. “At 48x P/E stock has a lot of risk. Growth investors are willing to take that risk. Value investors don't,"" Black said in early May. Buffett is known for his value investing — a strategy that focuses on stocks trading below their intrinsic value. Tesla, meanwhile, is a growth stock trading at an elevated P/E multiple. Tesla ended Friday’s session up 2.22% at $214.65, according to Benzinga Pro data.

12,Elon Musk biopic to be directed by Black Swan film-maker Darren Aronofsky,The Guardian,2023-11-11,The Oscar-nominated film-maker will adapt the recent biography by Walter Isaacson after independent studio A24 won a ‘heated’ ...,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/10/elon-musk-biopic-to-be-directed-by-black-swan-film-maker-darren-aronofsky,"The Oscar-nominated director will adapt the recent biography by Walter Isaacson after independent studio A24 won a ‘heated’ bidding war for rights A biopic of billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk is now in the works after independent studio A24 won the adaptation rights to Walter Isaacson’s recent biography, with Black Swan’s Darren Aronofsky on board to direct. Variety magazine reports that A24 triumphed in a “heated competition” bidding war to acquire Isaacson’s authorised biography Elon Musk, which was published in September. It was heavily criticised in some quarters, with the Guardian describing it as a “dull, insight-free doorstop of a book”, and it generated a number of controversies itself, with Isaacson forced to correct a suggestion that Musk had ordered his Starlink satellite communications network to be turned off to stop a Ukrainian drone attack on Russian warships. A former chair and CEO of CNN, Isaacson is the author of a string of biographies, including Henry Kissinger, Benjamin Franklin and Einstein. His bestselling 2011 biography of Apple CEO Steve Jobs was adapted into the 2015 biopic of the same title starring Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet, written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle. Aronofsky most recently directed The Whale, starring Brendan Fraser, for which Fraser won the best actor Oscar, while Aronofsky himself was nominated for the best director Oscar for dark ballet drama Black Swan. Sign up to Film Weekly Take a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that matters after newsletter promotion Musk, 52, was born and raised in South Africa and, according to Isaacson, suffered “mental torture” at the hands of his father Errol, from who he is estranged. Musk is CEO and chief technology officer of SpaceX, and chairman and CTO of X Corp (formerly Twitter). He is also CEO of car company Tesla, but was fined and forced to step down as chairman in 2018 in a deal with US financial regulators after a series of misleading social media posts. Musk is currently ranked at number one on Forbes’ Real Time Billionaires list with a net worth of $223.8bn (£183.2bn)."

Rating: On Nov. 8, 2023,  SpaceXMania.com published an article claiming that Elon Musk had written “He’s evil” about Bill Gates on X. The article stated, “Elon Musk’s Accusation Ignites a Public Feud with Bill Gates, Revealing Deep Differences and Influential Clashes in the Tech World.” The article also went on to state: While Musk’s tweet is concise, its implications are far-reaching. It not only calls into question Gates’ character but also suggests that there may be a history of discord and differences between the two. As Musk’s tweet went viral, it drew both praise and condemnation from various quarters. SpaceXLovers, a Facebook account for SpaceXMedia, also shared the article in a post and many users' comments suggested that they believed the story was real and supported Musk's alleged comment.

14,Grimes Says Elon Musk Evaded Being Served With Child Custody Papers At Least 12 Times,Yahoo News UK,2023-11-12,"The singer, who shares three children with Musk, claimed in court that process servers even searched for the billionaire at a ...",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/grimes-says-elon-musk-evaded-185529671.html,"Serving child custody papers to Elon Musk appears to be a full-time job. The tech billionaire reportedly evaded numerous process servers in at least a dozen locations after Grimes sued Musk in late September for physical custody of their three children, according to court documents obtained Friday by Insider. Proof-of-service papers filed last week showed Grimes hired four people who, between Oct. 13 and Oct. 20, tried serving Musk at the X headquarters in San Francisco, the SpaceX launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, and his Tesla gigafactory in Austin. They also tried several addresses tied to Musk — including a local horse farm. The obtained filing alleged one process server encountered a woman at the farm who, when asked if Musk was present at the time, curtly replied: “Nope, not here.” Another process server even tracked Musk’s private jets in an unsuccessful attempt to find him. Grimes, whose real name is Claire Boucher, reportedly filed a “petition to establish parental relationship” on Sept. 29. These are often required when two parents are unmarried, as is the case here, and one is seeking child support or custody. Musk reportedly started the legal battle with a similar lawsuit on Sept. 7. In October, the singer claimed in a Texas court that Musk had custody of their three-year-old son X Æ A-Xii over her “objection.” Two of the process servers hired in October reportedly tried to track Musk down at the home of Shivon Zilis, a director at his Neuralink startup and the mother of two of his kids. Someone who purported not to know Musk met them at the door. Musk and Grimes publicly debuted their relationship at the Met Gala in 2018. Process servers were told to vacate the Tesla factory and X offices by security guards and a police officer. However, Grimes argued in her filing that Musk was served as her complaint was left with security guards. Musk’s attorneys claimed Grimes should have continued trying to properly serve him, while her lawyers argued he was indeed served on Oct. 20 via substitute service — through Musk’s employees — and even mailed him the papers on that date. The controversial industrialist has 11 children with three different mothers. Musk and Grimes started dating in 2018 and share, in addition to their three-year-old, a nearly two-year-old daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl and a 2-month-old son named Techno Mechanicus. The couple broke up in 2021. Biographer Walter Isaacson notably posted about his book on Musk in September on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter (which Musk acquired for $44 billion in 2022), only for Grimes to reply: “Tell Elon to let me see my son or plz respond to my lawyer.” Sharon Stone Emotionally Recalls Former Sony Executive Exposing Himself To Her In The ’80s 'Withdraw The U.S. Extradition Request': Julian Assange Case Unites Squad And MAGA Member 'I Got A Visit': Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson Says He Was Asked To Run For President The exam the royal youngster is set to take has been described as 'a stress test' Karen Hauer, the dancing show’s longest-serving professional, and her husband Jordan Wyn-Jones reportedly parted ways last month Eamonn Holmes took to social media on Saturday as the GB News presenter shared an incredible family announcement, that will no doubt leave wife Ruth Langsford over the moon Gordon Ramsay has taken his fans by surprise as the Hell's Kitchen star revealed that he and wife Tana had welcomed their sixth child together following a very low-key pregnancy Take a look inside Princess Beatrice's stepson's unexpected bedroom decor that is so playful Noel Gallagher has reportedly reached a settlement in his divorce - and it is worth millions!

A Reuters investigation looked ...,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/spacex-workers-reportedly-took-adderall-173306915.html,"SpaceX workers reportedly put in over 80-hour workweeks in Elon Musk's race to colonize Mars. A Reuters investigation looked at 600 work injuries at SpaceX from 2014 to now. Musk has long been known for his ""maniacal sense of urgency,"" his biographer said. Some SpaceX workers resorted to taking Adderall to keep up with the pace of work at the company's launch facility, and others found themselves falling asleep in the bathroom during long workweeks, a recent Reuters investigation found. Travis Carson, a former SpaceX worker at the company's facility in Brownsville, Texas, told Reuters some workers took Adderall — a stimulant designed to help people with ADHD improve their focus and concentration levels — without a prescription to keep up with the pace of work. Carson was a welder and later a production supervisor at SpaceX from 2019 to 2022, when he was terminated following an argument with his manager, the publication said. Four current and former SpaceX workers at the location, including Carson, told the publication that employees would sometimes work over 80 hours a week and some would sleep at the facility to get more work done. Some employees would fall asleep in the bathrooms, the four current and former workers who spoke with Reuters said. SpaceX welders like Carson, the report said, would also work in tent structures at the launch site, sometimes dealing with temperatures in excess of 100 degrees Fahrenheit while welding rocket machinery. To address the heat issue, workers would receive IV treatments to continue working, Reuters reported. Elon Musk's rocket company, which employs about 13,000 people, had at least 600 worker injuries over the course of nine years across its facilities, the publication reported. The number does not represent the full number of injuries at SpaceX because the company has not submitted reports to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for any of the years it has been in operation, Reuters said. The injury rate at the facilities for the years that were reported exceeded space-industry averages for the same years, the publication said. In interviews with over 36 people, Reuters wrote that some current and former workers said the injuries pointed to Musk's breakneck pace for the company. The billionaire has long been pushing for SpaceX to build a rocket allowing humans to one day travel to Mars. Tom Moline, an ex-SpaceX engineer, told Reuters that he was one of a handful of employees fired after they brought forth complaints about SpaceX's work environment. Four current employees told Reuters Musk himself had even contributed to some of the safety concerns at SpaceX by toying with the company's flamethrower on-site, as well as through his aversion to bright colors that are sometimes used for safety reasons. Three ex-SpaceX supervisors told the publication Musk would have yellow machinery repainted to black or blue and some workers were told not to wear bright-yellow safety vests when the billionaire was on-site. A spokesperson for SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment ahead of publication. But the company has responded to OSHA inquiries, saying it's not liable for the worker injuries as the company gives workers safety training, Reuters reported. Responsible engineers ""are ultimately responsible for all aspects of their components and systems,"" the company said in a response to one OSHA inquiry, according to Reuters. Reuters' report came after some SpaceX employees wrote an open letter last year criticizing Musk's behavior as a ""source of distraction and embarrassment."" Musk has been known to run his companies with high intensity, sometimes calling for work sprints and even sleeping on the factory floor at Tesla. His biographer, Walter Isaacson, has said the billionaire has a ""maniacal sense of urgency"" that could frighten some of his workers — a characteristic that Isaacson said was effective 80% of the time and was ""problematic"" 20% of the time. Ultimately, the biographer said Musk believed empathy at the expense of the larger mission, like colonizing Mars, was a form of ""egotism."" Do you work for SpaceX or have insight to share?

Page reportedly once called Musk a speciesist in a discussion about humanity and AI safeguards. ""I haven't seen him in ages. We were friends for a very long time,"" Musk said of Page on Lex Fridman's podcast. Elon Musk wants to be on good terms with Larry Page again after the two fought over AI safeguards. In a new episode of Lex Fridman's podcast released Thursday, Musk said, ""I would like to be friends again with Larry. I haven't seen him in ages. We were friends for a very long time."" ""Really, the breaking of the friendship was over OpenAI,"" he added. The argument reportedly dates back to 2013. Walter Isaacson's biography of Musk details an exchange between Musk and Page at the former's birthday party that year, where they disagreed on the possibility that AI could replace humans. Page reportedly called Musk as a speciesist, meaning someone who favors humanity over all other species, while Musk said, ""Well, yes, I am pro-human, I fucking like humanity, dude,"" according to the biography. Page, however, thought machines could represent a new phase of evolution if they outpaced human intelligence. After their spat, Musk approached DeepMind cofounder and CEO Demis Hassabis later that year, trying to convince him not to sign a deal with Google, where Page was CEO at the time. ""The future of AI should not be controlled by Larry,"" Musk told Hassabis, according to the biography. Google announced its acquisition of DeepMind in 2014. Musk has discussed his strained friendship with Page before. In April, he told Tucker Carlson that Page ""doesn't want to talk to me anymore"" and ""got very upset with me about OpenAI."" ""When OpenAI was created, it did shift things from a unipolar world where Google's DeepMind controlled like three-quarters of all AI talent to where there is now sort of a bipolar world of OpenAI and Google DeepMind,"" Musk said at the time. ""Now, we're at least seeing OpenAI is maybe ahead."" Musk helped cofound OpenAI along with CEO Sam Altman and others in 2015 before starting a new venture recently, xAI, which released a generative AI chatbot called Grok this month. On Fridman's podcast, Musk also talked about personal challenges in his life. ""My mind is a storm,"" he said. I don't think most people would want to be me. They may think they'd want to be me but they don't know, they don't understand."" Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The film will be based on Walter Isaacson’s authorized biography of Musk, which was released in September, and will be produced by indie studio darling A24. The company will reportedly make use of the talents of Darren Aronofsky as director because if there's anything the world needs it's another film about a white dude directed by a white dude. This won't be Isaacson’s first Hollywood rodeo; his 2011 biography of Steve Jobs was adapted into a 2015 film starring Michael Fassbender, written by Aaron Sorkin, and produced by Universal. The internet is already throwing out dream casting picks, likeYellowjackets star Sophie Thatcher as Musk's paramour Grimes. Or — and hear them out —Grimes as herself. As for Musk, the internet's top contenders so far include Tim Robinson and Elliot Page. But many X/Twitter users don't want to see the film at all. Perhaps, if we're lucky, Musk will insist on playing himself and the production will come to a screeching halt.

19,Elon Musk says Israel could thwart Hamas with ‘conspicuous acts of kindness’,Yahoo,2023-11-12,Tech billionaire Elon Musk is advocating for an alternate path to peace between Israel and Hamas amid their war in Gaza: ...,https://www.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-says-israel-could-234841688.html,"Tech billionaire Elon Musk is advocating for an alternate path to peace between Israel and Hamas amid their war in Gaza: “conspicuous acts of kindness.” In an interview with podcast host Lex Fridman on Friday, Musk said Israel helping the people of Gaza would actually thwart the terrorist group’s intentions to rile up opposition to the Israeli government. “[Hamas] really wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel, and then leverage that aggressive response to rally Muslims worldwide for the cause of Gaza and Palestine,” Musk said. “Which they have succeeded in doing.” “So the counterintuitive thing here, the thing that I think should be done, even though it’s very difficult, is that I would recommend that Israel engage in the most conspicuous acts of kindness possible ever,” he continued. “That is the actual thing that would thwart the goal of Hamas.” The war in Gaza began early last month after Hamas militants killed more than a thousand Israeli civilians in a surprise attack. Israeli military counterstrikes have since have killed more than 11,000 Palestinians, including more than 4,000 children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Musk made clear that he was still in support of killing or jailing Hamas members when necessary, but that humanitarian initiatives in Gaza, for example, could squash Hamas’s support. The idea appeared similar to the U.S. “hearts and minds” campaign in Afghanistan, which hoped to bolster opposition to the Taliban through civilian investment and support. “There’s some talk of establishing, for example, a mobile hospital,” Musk said. “I recommend doing that. Just making sure that, you know, there’s food, water, medical necessities.” Musk later noted that the Israeli bombardment effort and ground invasion of Gaza is likely to backfire on the country and create even more resistance to Israel, instead of stomping it out. “For every Hamas member you kill, how many do you create?” he said. “If you kill somebody’s child in Gaza, you’ve made at least a few Hamas members.” The comments come amid rising calls for a cease-fire in the conflict. The Israeli government agreed, at the behest of the Biden administration, to short four-hour pauses in fighting in order to help civilians this week, but it has not considered a full cease-fire. French President Emmanuel Macron led calls for a cease-fire Friday, saying there is “no justification” for the Israeli war effort against civilians in Gaza. “In the immediate term, we need to work on protecting civilians,” Macron said. “To do that, we need a humanitarian pause very quickly, and we must work towards a cease-fire.” “It’s extremely important for all of us because of our principles, because we are democracies,” he continued. “It’s important for the mid-to-long run, as well for the security of Israel itself, to recognize that all lives matter.” Musk has previously warned of the dangerous potential for escalation in the Israel-Hamas war, saying that it could easily spiral into “World War III.” Late last month, he offered the use of his Starlink satellite internet service to humanitarian aid organizations in Gaza that could not communicate after Israel launched its ground invasion of the territory.

Elon Musk attends an in-conversation event with Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in London on ... [+] November 2, 2023. A24, the company behind Everything Everywhere All At Once, Lady Bird and Uncut Gems, won a bidding war for the rights to the film, according to Variety. The movie will be based on the Musk biography by Walter Isaacson released this fall, the same author whose work was used to produce the 2015 film Steve Jobs about the founder of Apple. Musk won't be the first founder whose life has been dramatized on screen, and the film follows those based on Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), Jeff Bezos (Amazon), Ray Kroc (McDonalds), Joy Mangano (Miracle Mop) and Douglas Fregin and Mike Lazaridis (BlackBerry). The Social Network, Aaron Sorkin’s movie about the founding of Facebook, grossed $96.9 million at the domestic box office, according to Box Office Mojo; Joy, the film about Mangano starring Jennifer Lawrence grossed $56.4 million domestically and The Founder, based on Kroc, grossed $12.8 million. Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, has had several movies based on his life—2013's Jobs starring Ashton Kutcher grossed $16.1 million domestically and Steve Jobs, based on the Isaacson book, made $17.7 million. Simply titled Elon Musk, the Isaacson biography was billed as a juicy tell-all about the founder but critics noted its exemption of Musk's more extrinsic side. New York Times critic Jennifer Szalai asked why the author didn't dig deeper into what makes the man, and Washington Post book critic Will Oremus said it lacked a “sophisticated critical lens.” Nonetheless, the book dove into parts of Musk before unseen, including his childhood in South Africa growing up with an abusive father, his “conspiratorial side"" and mistrust of bureaucratic regulations and his complex family dynamics—Musk has fathered 11 kids from three different women. Isaacson shadowed the SpaceX founder and CEO of Tesla and Twitter for two years before writing the book. Musk, the richest man in the world, was worth an estimated $223.8 billion as of Friday morning. On Thursday he lost $8.7 billion Thursday as Tesla stock sank 5.5% following weaker-than-expected quarterly results. He's still worth $40.8 million more than Bernard Arnault, the second-richest man in the world. Another book, titled Breaking Twitter: Elon Musk and the Most Controversial Corporate Takeover In History, was released this week and explores the $44 billion acquisition of Twitter by Musk last year. The book reveals what Mezrich says were Musk's words after signing the deal: ""Fuck Zuck."" Mezrich's books were the basis for films The Social Network and Dumb Money.  "

Musk said that Israel should display ""conspicuous acts of kindness"" toward Gaza. He also said that continued violence by Israel toward Gaza would play into what Hamas wanted. Israel's war in Gaza has been sparking debate and conversation since Hamas' terrorist attacks against Israel just over a month ago. Now, Elon Musk is weighing in, sharing his thoughts on the conflict on an episode of Lex Fridman's podcast, which was posted Thursday. Musk told Fridman that there's ""no easy answer"" to solve the conflict, but he did have some suggestions for Israel. He said that he believed Hamas had tried to provoke an ""overreaction"" from Israel in its October attacks so that people would later protest Israel's response. Musk told Fridman that Hamas ""obviously didn't expect to have a military victory,"" but wanted to ""commit the worst atrocities that they could so they provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel and then leverage that aggressive response to rally Muslims worldwide for the cause of Gaza and Palestine, which they have succeeded in doing."" Hamas leaders themselves have said that the goal of the invasion was to cause chaos in the area, The New York Times reported. Musk suggested that Israel should do something ""counterintuitive"" and try to ""thwart"" Hamas with ""conspicuous acts of kindness."" ""It is appropriate for Israel to find the Hamas members and, you know, either kill them or incarcerate them,"" Musk added. ""Something has to be done or they will keep coming otherwise."" But Musk told Fridman that Israel should also focus on ""unequivocal"" acts of kindness during the conflict. For example, it should make sure that Gaza has food, water, and medical supplies. He also said it's vital that these acts are unequivocal so that Hamas can't claim that it's a ""trick."" As Musk put it, Israel should respond with undeniable kindness because ""an eye for an eye makes everyone blind."" Musk said that continued violence in Gaza will leave behind even more people who hate Israel. ""For every Hamas member that you kill, how many did you create?"" Musk told Fridman. ""If you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you've made at least a few Hamas members."" If the goal of the conflict is to create peace, Musk said that Israel should be asking itself: ""Are more or fewer terrorists being created?"" As of Thursday, Gaza authorities estimate that 10,818 Palestinians have died and 26,905 have been wounded. Israeli authorities estimate 1,200 Israelis have died and 5,400 were wounded. Musk did not respond to Insider's request for additional comment ahead of publication. This isn't the first time Elon Musk has weighed in on the conflict. In October, Musk offered to bring Starlink internet to Gaza, in order to help aid groups and civilians. The move angered Israel, who had cut internet and telephone networks in Gaza days prior. Musk has also been accused of spreading misinformation about the conflict on X. In October, Musk shared and deleted a post encouraging people to check out accounts that were sharing misinformation, The Washington Post reported.

The world is watching the humanitarian crisis in Gaza unfold in real time through firsthand accounts documented on, of all places, Snapchat.  Israel has retaliated against Hamas’ October 7 attack with unprecedented force against the Palestinian territory, claiming over 9,000 Palestinian lives according to Gaza Health Ministry numbers reported by the Associated Press.

Elon Musk's grandiose ideas for Tesla must come to fruition to justify its high-priced stock, HSBC analysts said. In recent years, the company has made bold pledges related to its plans for humanoid robots, a supercomputer, and fully self-driving cars. ""Arguably, the ideas need to become reality to support the current share price,"" the analysts said in their November report seen by Insider. In other words, Musk is yet to deliver on his big promises. Musk previously said he was ""very confident"" that Tesla would be able to dispatch their cars as robotaxis by 2020. The EV maker is yet to gain regulatory approval for its Full Self-Driving Capability software, which has remained in beta since it was rolled out in 2020. Last year at Tesla's AI day, Musk made a bold prophecy that the company could be able to take orders for its humanoid robots, named Optimus, in three to five years, per Reuters.

Delivery was the analysts' ""primary concern,"" per their note, and although they believed Musk posed a risk, they also described him as an ""asset.""The caution around his ""risk,"" stemmed from the uncertainty around the timing and commercialization"" of the company's varied ideas, the analysts said.

Process servers attempted to deliver the papers at X and Tesla, and one even tracked Musk's jet. Grimes is suing Musk for physical custody of their three children. Grimes hired people to search high and low for her kids' father, Elon Musk, to serve him with custody papers, according to court records obtained by Insider. The singer, whose legal name is Claire Boucher, is suing Musk for physical custody of their three children. Grimes told a Texas court in October that Musk had custody of her three-year-old son, X Æ A-Xii, ""over [her] objection."" Her lawsuit came just a few weeks after Musk quietly sued her to ""establish the parent-child relationship"" with his children. A lawyer for Grimes filed a supplemental proof-of-service document last Friday, showing they had attempted to serve Musk with custody papers on multiple occasions and had delivered the documents via substituted service, meaning the papers were given to workers at some of Musk's businesses, as well as staff at a property associated with the billionaire, instead of Musk himself. As of Thursday, Musk had not formally responded to the lawsuit. Grimes hired four process servers to deliver the papers. From October 13 to October 20, they tried to track the billionaire down across at least a dozen locations, including X's headquarters in San Francisco, SpaceX's launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, Tesla's Austin gigafactory, and several addresses associated with Musk near Austin. One of the process servers even went to a horse farm that had been tied to the billionaire. ""Nope, not here,"" a woman on the site told them when they asked for Musk. One process server even tracked Musk's private jets to confirm the best place to contact the billionaire, Grimes' court papers said. Two process servers also attempted to serve Musk at Shivon Zilis' house. Zilis is a director at Neuralink, one of Musk's startups, and the mother of two of his children. But in at least one instance, the person who answered the door at Zilis' house told the process server they didn't know Musk, the court documents said. The process servers were unable to deliver the court documents to Musk personally and were shooed away in several instances, including by security personnel at Tesla and X and by a police officer in Boca Chica. The servers said they left the papers with several secondary personnel, including security workers at X, Tesla, and SpaceX, according to the court documents. In her court papers, Grimes said her process server handing her complaint to Musk's security at X was proof enough that she'd served her children's father. Christopher Melcher, a California family lawyer who's a partner at Walzer Melcher, told Insider that three attempts to serve someone were typically sufficient under California law and that Grimes' team ""made more than reasonable efforts."" He also said substitute service, when papers are left with someone else at the person's home or business, was acceptable if reasonable attempts were made to serve the papers directly. The practice is especially relevant in the case of someone who is rich or famous and has a lot of barriers around them. ""None of these security guards were going to let the process server in,"" Melcher said. ""They could've come 100 times."" While Musk and his lawyers could argue Grimes should've tried harder to serve him personally, Melcher said that would be ""completely silly."" ""He didn't evade service, but he's not really capable of being served because anyone who tried to approach him would be tackled by security,"" he added. Grimes' lawyers said in the supplemental proof of service that Musk was served via substitute service on October 20 and that they also mailed the custody papers to him on that date. Melcher said that typically, Musk would be required to respond 10 days after the substitute service, plus the typical 30 days, meaning he would have until November 29. Melcher added that another reason the date of service mattered was that a standing order preventing the children from being moved out of California did not apply to Musk until he was served. The next step for Musk would probably be to file a motion arguing the custody case should go forward in Texas, where he sued Grimes, rather than California. ""They will be in legal limbo for months until the jurisdictional dispute is resolved,"" Melcher said. Musk and lawyers for Musk and Grimes did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Insider on Thursday. The pair were in an off-and-on-again relationship that started in 2018. The couple first broke up in 2021, but they continued to co-parent their child. They also had a daughter together in 2021 and a third child, a son, in 2022. Grimes even continued to live with Musk in Austin for a period after they first broke up. But cracks started to appear in their relationship in September when Grimes wrote and then quickly deleted a post on X that appeared to mention legal trouble. ""Tell Elon to let me see my son or plz respond to my lawyer,"" Grimes wrote in the since-deleted September 7 post. She wrote the post in response to a picture Musk's biographer had shared of Musk with Zilis at her home in Austin. Musk has 10 known living children whom he has fathered with three women, including his youngest, a 1-year-old son named Techno Mechanicus, or Tau, whom he fathered with Grimes and was born via a surrogate last summer.

Musk estimated that it will take about 18 months until the Cybertruck is cash flow positive. Here's what you need to know about how to watch Sunday Night Football.

25,Grimes resorted to tracking Elon Musk's private jets in attempt to serve him with custody papers,Yahoo,2023-11-11,"Grimes hired process servers to serve Elon Musk custody papers, and one even tried private jet tracking, something he has ...",https://www.yahoo.com/news/grimes-resorted-tracking-elon-musks-170812161.html,"Grimes paid multiple process servers to try to deliver a lawsuit to Musk. One process server used a jet-tracking to try to serve Elon Musk with the custody papers. Grimes is suing Musk for physical custody of their three children. A person hired by Grimes' legal team tracked Elon Musk's private jets for days in an attempt to serve him with custody papers, according to court documents obtained by Insider. A lawyer for Grimes filed a supplemental proof of service document in a California court on November 3. The court document showed that over the course of a week in October, multiple process servers — people hired to deliver legal documents to defendants — attempted to deliver custody papers to Musk at several locations, including X's headquarters, Tesla's Texas gigafactory, and SpaceX's launch site in Boca Chica, Texas. The process servers were not able to deliver the papers personally to Musk and were only able to serve the documents via substituted service — when papers are left with someone else at a person's home or business rather than the person themself — according to the court documents. Grimes is suing Musk for physical custody of her three children that Musk fathered. The artist, whose legal name is Claire Boucher, told a Texas court last month that Musk has physical custody of one of her children, X Æ A-XII, ""over [her] objection."" She has asked a Texas court to throw out a separate lawsuit from Musk that he filed prior to Grimes' custody suit. The billionaire had sued Grimes in September to ""establish the parent-child relationship"" with his children. Musk and lawyers for Musk and Grimes did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment on Thursday. In Grimes' latest filing, she documented numerous attempts to serve Musk with the custody papers. Over the course of a week, four different process servers attempted to track down the billionaire, the court records show. One process server even followed the whereabouts of Musk's private jets from October 13 to 17, writing that Musk ""utilizes his aircraft to such an extent that his travel on his owned aircraft has been likened to a rideshare, such as Uber."" Musk has been known to use his private jets to fly between his companies, including Tesla's headquarters in Texas and X's in San Francisco. The process server said in the court documents that she was initially unable to track Musk's private jets using sites, like FlightAware, which receive their data via the Federal Aviation Administration. Insider previously reported Musk utilizes an FAA feature called the ""Limited Aircraft Data Displayed"" program or LADD to cloak his travel. The LADD list prevents flight data from being shown on sites that use FAA data and is used by several celebrities and public figures, including Jeff Bezos and Taylor Swift. Up until recently, the billionaire had also attempted to dodge jet-tracking by using another FAA system designed to hide private jet travel, the privacy ICAO aircraft address program, also known as PIA. But Insider reported Musk gave up on the system in December after it was unable to prevent people from tracking his jets on social media. Similarly, the process server said in the court documents she was able to track Musk's jets using ""crowdsourced data, collected from radio signals transmitted from aircraft."" Jet-trackers are able to get around FAA programs like the LADD list by using sites like the ADS-B Exchange, a public flight-tracking database that collects data from a network of volunteer-run radios or ""feeders"" that transmit data from ADS-B-equipped aircraft. (ADS-B is a surveillance technology that broadcasts information like a plane's GPS location and altitude from one aircraft to another, as well as to ground stations.) Musk has spoken out against jet-tracking in the past, famously offering a college student who posted his jet travels on social media $5,000 to stop sharing his flight data and then later temporarily banning that same student on X. The process server said she even set up ""surveillance positions"" near hangars and along the runway at an airport in Hawthorne, California, when one of Musk's jets flew to the location on October 16, but the server was unable to connect with Musk directly, according to the court documents. Christopher Melcher, a California family law attorney and partner at Walzer Melcher, told Insider that the use of jet tracking by the process server was unusual but not unreasonable. ""Typically we don't have any knowledge of the comings and goings of these people, so it's reasonable to knock on their door or go to their place of business"" and expect them to be there, he said. However, if there is publicly available information that shows Musk is in another state or country, like the jet-tracking data, it wouldn't be reasonable to show up at his home and expect to be able to hand deliver papers to him. In her court papers, Grimes' team said a different process server who had handed her complaint to Musk's security at X was proof enough that she'd served the billionaire.

Isaacson’s biography Steve Jobs was adapted for the screen back in 2015 starring Michael Fassbender. (In a Q&A attended by The A.V.

The film will be based on Walter ...,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/elon-musk-biopic-way-darren-153015474.html,"Darren Aronofsky is making an Elon Musk biopic at A24, according to a new report. Puck first broke the news that the biopic is on the way, though further details on the project are so far very scarce. At the moment, the only concrete information beyond director and studio is that the film will be based on Walter Isaacson's authorized biography (titled Elon Musk). This isn't the first of Isaacson's biographies to get the movie treatment: his book Steve Jobs was turned into a film starring Michael Fassbender and directed by Danny Boyle. Per Variety, there was ""heated competition"" to snap up Isaacson's Musk biography from both filmmakers and studios, though A24 came out on top. The combination of Aronofsky and A24 is certainly an intriguing one – Aronofsky has helmed the likes of Black Swan, The Whale, and Requiem for a Dream, which all venture into the realm of the surreal at times. A24 is also a studio that is no stranger to the unconventional. Perhaps we should expect the unexpected with this particular biopic, then? As for Musk, he's been in the headlines recently after purchasing Twitter, which he has since renamed X. You may also know of him as the founder and CEO of SpaceX, and the CEO of Tesla. He's officially the world's richest person, too.

Altman on Thursday night posted a screenshot of the latest version of OpenAI's platform, which now allows you to create customized versions of ChatGPT called GPTs. In his version, he instructs it: Be a chatbot that answers questions with cringey boomer humor in an awkward shock-to-get-laughs sort of way. ChatGPT Builder replies: Great, the chatbot is set up!

There's bad blood between Altman and Musk, once former friends. Musk and Altman, along with others including Peter Thiel, founded OpenAI as a non-profit in 2015, with a goal of advancing open sourced research on artificial intelligence. According to Walter Isaacson's biography of Musk, Musk was upset when OpenAI, under Altman, transitioned away from a pure non-profit and partnered with Microsoft. It was also perhaps no coincidence that the announcement of Grok happened just days before OpenAI's highly-anticipated DevDay event this week, where the custom ChatGPTs were announced.

Process servers attempted to deliver the papers at X and Tesla, and one even tracked Musk's jet. Grimes is suing Musk for physical custody of their three children. Grimes hired people to search high and low for her kids' father, Elon Musk, to serve him with custody papers, according to court records obtained by Insider. The singer, whose legal name is Claire Boucher, is suing Musk for physical custody of their three children. Grimes told a Texas court in October that Musk had custody of her three-year-old son, X Æ A-Xii, ""over [her] objection."" Her lawsuit came just a few weeks after Musk quietly sued her to ""establish the parent-child relationship"" with his children. A lawyer for Grimes filed a supplemental proof-of-service document last Friday, showing they had attempted to serve Musk with custody papers on multiple occasions and had delivered the documents via substituted service, meaning the papers were given to workers at some of Musk's businesses, as well as staff at a property associated with the billionaire, instead of Musk himself. As of Thursday, Musk had not formally responded to the lawsuit. Grimes hired four process servers to deliver the papers. From October 13 to October 20, they tried to track the billionaire down across at least a dozen locations, including X's headquarters in San Francisco, SpaceX's launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, Tesla's Austin gigafactory, and several addresses associated with Musk near Austin. One of the process servers even went to a horse farm that had been tied to the billionaire. ""Nope, not here,"" a woman on the site told them when they asked for Musk. One process server even tracked Musk's private jets to confirm the best place to contact the billionaire, Grimes' court papers said. Two process servers also attempted to serve Musk at Shivon Zilis' house. Zilis is a director at Neuralink, one of Musk's startups, and the mother of two of his children. But in at least one instance, the person who answered the door at Zilis' house told the process server they didn't know Musk, the court documents said. The process servers were unable to deliver the court documents to Musk personally and were shooed away in several instances, including by security personnel at Tesla and X and by a police officer in Boca Chica. The servers said they left the papers with several secondary personnel, including security workers at X, Tesla, and SpaceX, according to the court documents. In her court papers, Grimes said her process server handing her complaint to Musk's security at X was proof enough that she'd served her children's father. Christopher Melcher, a California family lawyer who's a partner at Walzer Melcher, told Insider that three attempts to serve someone were typically sufficient under California law and that Grimes' team ""made more than reasonable efforts."" He also said substitute service, when papers are left with someone else at the person's home or business, was acceptable if reasonable attempts were made to serve the papers directly. The practice is especially relevant in the case of someone who is rich or famous and has a lot of barriers around them. ""None of these security guards were going to let the process server in,"" Melcher said. ""They could've come 100 times."" While Musk and his lawyers could argue Grimes should've tried harder to serve him personally, Melcher said that would be ""completely silly."" ""He didn't evade service, but he's not really capable of being served because anyone who tried to approach him would be tackled by security,"" he added. Grimes' lawyers said in the supplemental proof of service that Musk was served via substitute service on October 20 and that they also mailed the custody papers to him on that date. Melcher said that typically, Musk would be required to respond 10 days after the substitute service, plus the typical 30 days, meaning he would have until November 29. Melcher added that another reason the date of service mattered was that a standing order preventing the children from being moved out of California did not apply to Musk until he was served. The next step for Musk would probably be to file a motion arguing the custody case should go forward in Texas, where he sued Grimes, rather than California. ""They will be in legal limbo for months until the jurisdictional dispute is resolved,"" Melcher said. Musk and lawyers for Musk and Grimes did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Insider on Thursday. The pair were in an off-and-on-again relationship that started in 2018. The couple first broke up in 2021, but they continued to co-parent their child. They also had a daughter together in 2021 and a third child, a son, in 2022. Grimes even continued to live with Musk in Austin for a period after they first broke up. But cracks started to appear in their relationship in September when Grimes wrote and then quickly deleted a post on X that appeared to mention legal trouble. ""Tell Elon to let me see my son or plz respond to my lawyer,"" Grimes wrote in the since-deleted September 7 post. She wrote the post in response to a picture Musk's biographer had shared of Musk with Zilis at her home in Austin. Musk has 10 known living children whom he has fathered with three women, including his youngest, a 1-year-old son named Techno Mechanicus, or Tau, whom he fathered with Grimes and was born via a surrogate last summer.

Musk estimated that it will take about 18 months until the Cybertruck is cash flow positive. Here's what you need to know about how to watch Sunday Night Football.

The studio nabbed the film rights to the book after a fierce bidding war, according to the source. “The deal was highly competitive with top studios and filmmakers in contention,"" the source said. A24 previously teamed with Aronofsky on last year's ""The Whale,"" starring Brendan Fraser in an Oscar-winning role.

The source said A24 will co-produce the Musk film with Aronofsky's production company, Protozoa Pictures. It was not immediately clear who would be tapped to portray Musk in the film. Puck reporter Matt Belloni, who first reported the news, suggested actors such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Paul Dano, Shia LaBeouf and Joaquin Phoenix. ""I’d pick Michael Fassbender if he hadn’t already starred in 'Steve Jobs,'"" Belloni wrote, referring to a 2015 film based on Isaacson's bestselling biography of the Apple founder.

He also has taken over Twitter—sorry, X. And now he’s coming for our movie screens. The Tesla and SpaceX founder will be the subject of a new biopic directed by the Oscar-nominated Darren Aronofsky, NBC News reported on Friday. An anonymous source close to the project told the outlet that the production company A24 was developing the film, which will be based on Walter Isaacson’s biography about the mercurial Musk. The book made all kinds of headlines when it was published in September, and a bidding war broke out for rights to the content.

A24 will produce the film alongside Aronofsky’s Protozoa Pictures. The company previously worked with the director on The Whale, which won Brendan Fraser an acting Oscar earlier this year. Aronofsky himself was nominated for his 2010 movie, Black Swan, and he’s known for other titles like Pi, Requiem for a Dream, and The Wrestler. Since being founded in 2012, A24 has become something of a cinematic powerhouse. Two of its movies—Moonlight and Everything Everywhere All at Once—have won the Oscar for Best Picture. It’s released a slew of other critically acclaimed films, including Lady Bird, Uncut Gems, and Room. Few details about the Musk movie have been released so far, but the question on everyone’s mind is likely who will play the tech entrepreneur. Matt Belloni of Puck, who broke the news, suggested a number of names, such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Paul Dano, Shia LaBeouf, and Joaquin Phoenix. He added that he would have picked Michael Fassbender if he hadn’t already played Steve Jobs in a 2015 biopic about the Apple founder, which was also based on an Isaacson book. Given the lengthy filmmaking process—and the fact that the actors’ strike in Hollywood just ended—it’ll probably be a while before we see Aronofsky’s take on Musk’s life. But those both in and outside the industry will likely be following the news surrounding the movie closely, especially when it comes to casting announcements.

Walter Isaacson’s authorized biography of the controversial tech mogul, which was published in September, will serve as the basis for the screenplay. Isaacson’s ""Steve Jobs” book was previously adapted into the 2015 Universal film of the same name, directed by Danny Boyle and starring Michael Fassbender as the Apple CEO. Sources told Variety that there was heated competition to option Isaacson’s book from studios and filmmakers alike, with A24 ultimately winning the bidding war. Aronofsky, whose past credits include Pi (1998), Requiem for a Dream (2000), Black Swan (2010), Mother! (2017), and last year’s Oscar contender The Whale. Most recently, he directed the film Postcards from Earth, currently showing exclusively at The Sphere in Las Vegas. So maybe this won’t be the conventional biopic formula, and we should expect the unexpected... There’s plenty to go on when it comes to Musk. The founder and CEO of SpaceX and the CEO of Tesla is constantly hogging the headlines with some erratic behaviour and comments, and especially since purchasing Twitter for $44 billion - which he has since renamed X. He's also officially the world's richest person, with Bloomberg and Forbes estimating his net worth to be more than $200 billion as of October 2023.

Coming off from the critical success of 2022’s The Whale, Darren Aronofsky is once again teaming up with A24 to helm the upcoming Elon Musk biopic. The Elon Musk biopic will be based on Walter Isaacson’s recently published novel. According to the outlet’s sources, a competitive bidding war between studios and filmmakers started for the rights to option Isaacson’s latest book. In the end, A24 won the bid. As preparation for the book, Isaacson learned about Musk’s life after shadowing him for two years, where he was allowed to attend the tech giant’s meetings, and was granted the opportunity to interview Musk, his family, friends, co-workers, and other people involved in his life. This isn’t the first time that Isaacson’s novel would be getting a film adaptation. In 2015, his 2011 book about Steve Jobs was adapted by Legendary Pictures into a movie starring Michael Fassbender as the Apple Inc. founder.

The film’s going to be based on Walter Isaacson’s authorized biography, which has received its share of unfavorable reviews, with outlets like the Los Angeles Times suggesting the author “mostly accepts Musk’s confident prognostications as gospel” and The Guardian calling it an “insight-free doorstop.” Not all reviews were that dire, of course, but many point to Isaacson’s book as being a clear example of the perils of access journalism.

The movie from A24 is to be based on Walter Isaacson’s authorized biography of Musk. So the guessing game is on: Who would best capture the essence of the mercurial, meme-loving tech mogul on the big screen? More from Variety Elon Musk Biopic in the Works at A24 With Darren Aronofsky Set to Direct 'Priscilla's' Locket Choker from Sofia Coppola's Film Now Available to Buy X Is Now Worth $19 Billion, Down 57% From $44 Billion When Elon Musk Bought Twitter It won’t surprise you to learn that the internet has already chewed over this question. In a recent Reddit thread, commenters’ top-voted casting picks for Musk were: Nicolas Cage, Rami Malek, Robert Downey Jr. and Jesse Eisenberg (the last being a troll’s pick: Eisenberg starred as Musk rival Mark Zuckerberg in “The Social Network”). Other suggestions from sundry corners of the web have included Brendan Fraser (who incidentally starred in Aronofsky’s “The Whale”); Matt LeBlanc of “Friends” fame; Scottish-American actor John Barrowman (“Doctor Who,” “Torchwood”); Kevin Durand (“The Strain,” “X-Men Origins: Wolverine”); and Matthew Broderick. Here are some additional thoughts: Elon Musk as himself: The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and owner of X (aka Twitter), hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 2021 and he has taken a (brief) stab at stand-up comedy. He also had a cameo as himself in 2010’s “Iron Man 2” (in which he tells Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark at a reception, “Got an idea for an electric jet”). The time commitment involved in shooting a feature-length movie would probably make this impossible, given Musk’s numerous other obligations. But Musk’s ego would be up for it. Jon Hamm: The “Mad Men” star portrayed Musk-like tech billionaire Paul Marks in Season 3 of Apple TV+’s “The Morning Show.” Hamm’s resemblance to Musk isn’t quite on the mark, but it’s conceivable the actor could pull off a decent take on Musk’s clipped-and-mumble-y speech patterns. An AI-generated version of Musk: This would likely amuse and intrigue Musk, who last month opined in a post on X, “Shows created with the help of AI will be extremely good.” Musk has alternately been excited about the potential of artificial intelligence (he co-founded OpenAI before exiting the company, and recently launched his own startup in the space, xAI) while also warning of the technology’s risks and saying that “AI safety is vital the future of civilization.” Kathy Bates: The internet, like Musk himself, loves a good meme and it has been suggested more than once that Bates is a bit of a doppelganger. Fun but an obvious nonstarter. If there’s a movie about Elon, I want him to be played by Kathy Bates. pic.twitter.com/kfYGghBRpA — Ravi Ahuja (@RaviAhuja20) November 25, 2022 Meanwhile, we posed the question of who would best play Musk to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The chatbot prefaced its answer with a cautionary note: “As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, it’s challenging to predict who would play Elon Musk in a movie since casting decisions depend on various factors.” ChatGPT continued, “As of my last update, potential candidates might include actors like Tom Hardy, Robert Downey Jr., or even someone not yet widely recognized but with the talent to capture Musk’s unique persona.” Musk has launched his own AI chatbot rival to ChatGPT, dubbed Grok, but access currently is limited to verified subscribers of X Premium (formerly Twitter Blue).

41,The Whale director to helm Elon Musk biopic: Tech mogul's life made into a movie by studio famous for making gruesome and unnervingly bleak horror movies,Daily Mail,2023-11-11,The rollercoaster life of billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk is set to be made into a movie helmed by Oscar-nominated The Whale ...,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12735493/The-Whale-director-helm-Elon-Musk-biopic.html,"By Eve Buckland For Dailymail.Com   Published:  17:57, 10 November 2023   |  Updated:  19:03, 10 November 2023      14 View  comments  The rollercoaster life of billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk is set to be made into a movie helmed by Oscar-nominated The Whale director Darren Aronofsky. The biopic, which is in development at studio A24 - known for gruesome films including Midsommar and Heriditary - will be based on  Walter Isaacson’s authorized biography of Musk, which was released in September. Variety reports there was 'heated competition' to option the biography from studios and filmmakers. Musk addressed the news on X on Friday, writing in response to a post by X News Daily: 'Glad Darren is doing it. He is one of the best.' The author, who previously wrote an exhaustive biography of the equally controversial Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, was given unprecedented access to the Tesla and SpaceX owner over more than two years.  On screen: The rollercoaster life of billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk is set to be made into a movie helmed by Oscar-nominated The Whale director Darren Aronofsky  Isaacson observed Musk go about his daily life and conducted interviews with him and members of his family to build a picture of his life.  His book chronicles Musk's rise to fame through his SpaceX ventures, selling a million cars through Tesla, and becoming the richest man alive.  Isaacson's explosive Elon biography is due to be released in September 2023  However, the writer's insights into 52-year-old Musk's private life — particularly his tortured relationship with an oppressive father and a seemingly warped inclination to find similar discord in his romantic life — are revealing for a world struggling to understand the enigmatic and astonishingly influential tycoon. 'Musk was not bred for domestic tranquillity. Most of his romantic relationships involve psychological turmoil,' observes Isaacson.  Isaacson's much-anticipated memoir was plugged as a deep-dive into the dark psychology of the Twitter tsar and his family. Isaacson said chronicling Musk's life became 'a hell of a lot more of a rollercoaster ride' after he bought Twitter and rebranded it as X - which is also when the darker side of his personality began to emerge more clearly in the public sphere. Musk is worth an estimated $231billion. Musk first moved to Silicon Valley at the age of 24 without a penny to his name, his father Errol flogged his yacht and game reserve in South Africa to scrape together £23,000 to help set up his son.  Acclaimed: Darren is pictured right with The Whale Oscar winner Brendan Fraser Seal of approval: Musk commented on the pending biopic on Friday Isaacson observed Musk's day-to-day life for two years, including during his Twitter takeover when he fired more than half the workforce  SpaceX founder Elon Musk and Canadian musician Grimes in 2018 at a SpaceX competition Wife two: British actress Talulah Riley who he married in 2010, divorced two years later and married again in 2013 - pictured 2014   Four years later, Elon's first dotcom company Zip2 sold for £250 million.  Today,  Musk's formidable business empire includes the electric car company Tesla (worth almost a trillion dollars), the space exploration company SpaceX (which has 24,000 satellites circling Earth) and Twitter, renamed X.  The South African-born billionaire's approach to children is even more impenetrable. He believes that humanity needs to produce offspring at a far quicker rate, or civilisation will crumble. Although it was previously assumed that he has ten children by three women, the book has revealed that he has had an eleventh with his former on-off girlfriend Claire Boucher, alias Canadian pop star Grimes.  In the grand tradition of Musk's taste for outlandish children's names, the little boy, born in June last year, is called Techno Mechanicus. There are two ex-wives, Justine (mother to six of his brood, the eldest of who, Nevada, died of sudden infant death syndrome aged ten weeks) and British actress Talulah Riley who he married in 2010, divorced two years later and married again in 2013.

The Tesla and X boss unveiled the new artificial intelligence over the weekend, claiming that its access to real-time data from his social media platform makes it superior to rivals like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Bard.  “Grok has real-time access to info via the X platform, which is a massive advantage over other models,” Mr Musk said. “It’s also based and loves sarcasm. I have no idea who could have guided it this way,” he added, together with a shrug emoji and a crying laughing emoji. The tech billionaire shared a screenshot of Grok offering a “humorous” step-by-step guide to making cocaine, which included instructions like “start cooking and hope you don’t blow yourself up or get arrested”. He followed it up with a separate screenshot offering more detailed instructions on how to produce the Class A drug from its raw materials. Mr Musk released the chatbot, which was developed by his new AI company xAI, just six months after signing an open letter calling on companies to pause development of artificial intelligence systems for six months. “I signed on to that letter knowing it was futile,” he wrote on X on Sunday. “I just wanted to be on record as recommending a pause.” Its unveiling also comes just days after Mr Musk warned that AI is “one of the biggest threats to humanity” at a global AI safety summit in Bletchley Park, hosted by Rishi Sunak. Grok is currently only available to paying subscribers to X Premium, though Mr Musk said that a standalone app for the xAI chatbot will be released in the future. XAI claimed in a blog post that its bot is more powerful than freely available rivals like ChatGPT and Bard, however admitted that it lags behind premium versions of the technology like OpenAI’s GPT-4. “We hand-graded our model on the 2023 Hungarian national high school finals in mathematics,” the blog post noted. “Grok passed the exam with a C (59 per cent), while...

A24 optioned Walter Issacson’s new biography of Musk, the controversial CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, which will be turned into a film adaptation. Aronofsky is set to direct and produce the film with his production company Protozoa Pictures.

Isaacson shadowed Musk for two years and attended his meetings, toured his companies’ factories and spent hours interviewing Musk and his family, friends, colleagues and apparent adversaries. By 2022, Tesla had sold one million electric cars and SpaceX launched 31 rockets into space. Another of Issacson’s books about a tech pioneer, this time about Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, was turned into a titular movie with Michael Fassbender playing the Apple CEO, and Danny Boyle directing a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.

46,Key To Successful Movies On Tech Moguls Elon Musk & Sam Bankman-Fried? Go Dark & Unauthorized,Yahoo News UK,2023-11-11,Word is circulating online that A24 wants Darren Aronofsky to turn the Walter Isaacson authorized biography on Elon Musk into ...,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/key-successful-movies-tech-moguls-163836013.html,"Word is circulating online that A24 wants Darren Aronofsky to turn the Walter Isaacson authorized biography on Elon Musk into a feature film. This comes as Apple is working toward the same goal with fallen cryptocurrency kingpin Samuel Bankman-Fried based on the subject-friendly Michael Lewis book Going Infinite. These can be tricky assignments especially when the subjects are still living their third acts, but in the case of Musk in particular, Aronofsky and A24 will have to deal with the sobering prospect: do they make a Faustian bargain with Musk that gives access, but might also turn arguably the most polarizing figure in the world this side of Donald Trump into someone warm and fuzzy? More from Deadline Ayo Edebiri & John Malkovich To Topline A24 Horror 'Opus'; Murray Bartlett, Amber Midthunder & Others Also Aboard, With Juliette Lewis In Talks FTX Crypto King Sam Bankman-Fried Guilty Of Seven Counts Of Fraud, Faces Potential Long Prison Sentence A24's 'Death Of A Unicorne' Adds Richard E. Grant, Téa Leoni, Will Poulter, Anthony Carrigan, Sunita Mani & More; Paul Rudd And Jenna Ortega Set To Star On the Bankman-Friedman book, the intriguing thing is that this nerd who has been convicted of fraud and costing many a lot of money has a book written by Lewis that was knocked big time for being too kind to the subject. These movies can be tricky when the subject is in the process of living their third act. Musk’s prowess is estimable with Tesla and SpaceX (Tom Cruise will raise that profile even higher by traveling to space with director Doug Liman to shoot the first feature in outer space), but his track record so far with Twitter (now X) leaves much to be desired as does so many other parts of this most complicated man. The best move these films could make is to not make an accommodation with the subjects. While Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg was in talks at one time to be involved in The Social Network, the filmmakers David Fincher, Scott Rubin and Aaron Sorkin smartly decided not to go that route because it would have conceivably compromised their creative vision. I remember writing about a Phil Spector movie that Tom Cruise was going to make with Cameron Crowe, latter of whom told me, even though Tom had the Wall of Sound music producer’s manner down pat, there was no satisfying third act. Well, there sure was a third act when the gun-happy Spector was convicted of shooting a woman in his estate. But the movie was authorized — the filmmakers needed song rights, and at the time there didn’t seem a downside — and there was no way Spector and his reps were going to allow that story to be told. These movies work best when they are tales told as darkly as possible, like the limited series on the opioid-making Sackler family. Zuckerberg’ s image was enhanced by Social Network because the movie, and Jesse Eisenberg’s performance, were so good. But giving up any creative freedom could leave any of the makers of these projects writing off an expensive book rights deal, because the resulting sanitized movie would be met with scorn.

Who run the Grammys? Girls, at least this year. The 2024 Grammy nominations were ...",https://www.yahoo.com/news/daily-gossip-women-dominate-2024-212130889.html,"Who run the Grammys? Girls, at least this year. The 2024 Grammy nominations were unveiled Friday, and women dominated the top categories. In fact, just a single male performer, Jon Batiste, was nominated for record of the year or album of the year. SZA led the pack overall with nine nominations, while Phoebe Bridgers and Victoria Monét earned seven. Boygenius, Miley Cyrus, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo and Taylor Swift earned six. Monét had a shockingly strong showing after the ""On My Mama"" singer revealed in September her ""team was told it is 'too early in my story'"" for her to perform at the MTV Video Music Awards. The ""Barbie"" soundtrack also performed quite well, earning 11 nominations. Dua Lipa's ""Dance The Night"" and Eilish's ""What Was I Made For?"" were nominated for song of the year and best song written for visual media, and the latter category also consisted of ""Barbie World"" and ""I'm Just Ken."" Sadly, M3GAN's unforgettable rendition of ""Titanium"" was snubbed. Recording Academy Darren Aronofsky is going from π to X. The ""Black Swan"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" filmmaker will direct a biopic about Tesla CEO Elon Musk, which is in the works at A24, a source confirmed to The Week. The news was first reported by Puck. The movie will be based on a recent biography of Musk written by Walter Isaacson, which A24 has optioned, and the deal for the project was said to be highly competitive. Aronofsky will also produce the movie with his production company, Protozoa Pictures. His most recent film was ""The Whale,"" which won two Oscars, including best actor for Brendan Fraser. The director will certainly have plenty of material to work with, as Isaacson's biography is nearly 700 pages. Isaacson previously wrote the biography that was turned into the 2015 Danny Boyle movie ""Steve Jobs."" So who should play Musk? There's only one way to decide: a totally scientific social media poll. Puck Wile E. Coyote has been foiled once again, this time by tax write-offs. Warner Bros. has given the ""Batgirl"" treatment to another movie by shelving ""Coyote Vs. Acme,"" a comedy starring John Cena that already finished filming. The ""Looney Tunes"" film involved Wile E. Coyote trying to sue the Acme Corporation. It was originally intended to debut on Max, formerly HBO Max, so Warner Bros. cited the fact that it has ""shifted its global strategy to focus on theatrical releases."" The studio, which previously killed a ""Batgirl"" movie that was already filmed, will take a $30 million tax write-off after shelving ""Coyote Vs. Acme,"" Deadline reports. The decision sparked widespread criticism, in part because ""Coyote Vs. Acme"" was rumored to be quite good. ""I have seen this movie and it is excellent,"" said ""No One Will Save You"" director Brian Duffield, who added that ""the people working at Warner Bros are anti-art and I hope multiple anvils drop on their heads."" The Hollywood Reporter Keke Palmer has been granted a temporary restraining order against her ex-boyfriend, Darius Jackson, as well as temporary sole custody of their 8-month-old son, People reports. In court documents obtained by Us Weekly, the ""Nope"" star accused Jackson of ""many instances of physical violence,"" including destroying her property, ""throwing my belongings into the street, throwing my car keys to prevent me from driving away, hitting [me] in front of our son, spewing profanities about me to our son, threatening to kill himself with a gun if I left him, harassment, and other physical and emotional abuse."" She also alleged he trespassed into her home and threatened her before ""lunging for my neck, striking me, throwing me over the couch and stealing my phone."" According to Palmer, their relationship ended in early October due to Jackson's alleged abuse. As news of the allegations broke, Jackson shared a photo of himself with their child on X, formerly Twitter, writing, ""I love you, son. See you soon."" People, Us Weekly The state of the Marvel union is troubled. Disney has delayed several upcoming Marvel films just before ""The Marvels,"" which looks set to underperform at the box office, hits theaters. ""Deadpool 3"" was postponed from May to July 2024, giving the studio more time to complete filming that was suspended due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. More surprising, though, was ""Captain America: Brave New World"" changing calendar years by moving from July 2024 to February 2025, even though it wrapped filming months ago. ""Thunderbolts"" was also moved from December 2024 to July 2025, and ""Blade"" was delayed from February 2025 to November 2025. This means only one MCU movie will be released in 2024 compared to three this year, which could work out for the best by giving audiences a break from the franchise after several recent disappointments. It remains to be seen if the time off can help Marvel get its mojo back or if the MCU's domination truly reached its endgame with ""Endgame.""

Walter Isaacson’s authorized biography of the controversial tech mogul, which was published in September, will serve as the basis for the screenplay. Isaacson’s “Steve Jobs” book was previously adapted into the 2015 Universal film of the same name, starring Michael Fassbender as the Apple CEO. More from Variety 'Priscilla's' Locket Choker from Sofia Coppola's Film Now Available to Buy X Is Now Worth $19 Billion, Down 57% From $44 Billion When Elon Musk Bought Twitter Nicolas Cage's 'Dream Scenario' Heads to Germany Via DCM (EXCLUSIVE) Sources tell Variety that there was heated competition to option Isaacson’s book from studios and filmmakers alike, with A24 ultimately winning the bidding war. Aronofsky, who most recently directed last year’s Oscar contender “The Whale” starring Brendan Fraser, is known for his surreal filmmaking style, which often includes psychological elements. His past credits include “Requiem for a Dream” (2000), “Black Swan” (2010) and “Mother!” (2017). For his work on “Black Swan,” Aronofsky was nominated for the best director Oscar, while Portman ended up winning the best actress award. Musk first rose to prominence when he founded SpaceX, a spacecraft manufacturing company, in 2002. He was also an early investor in Tesla, and eventually climbed the ranks to become the automotive giant’s chairman (a position he stepped down from in 2018 after he was sued by the SEC), product architect and CEO. Most recently, Musk made the controversial decision to purchase Twitter for $44 billion, rebranding it to X. Since taking over the social media platform, Musk has made several changes that have resulted in backlash, including laying off a large number of the company’s employees, charging users for verification and removing headlines from links shared on the site. He is currently the wealthiest person in the world, with Bloomberg and Forbes estimating his net worth to be more than $200 billion as of October. Musk addressed the news on X later on Friday, writing in response to a post by X News Daily: “Glad Darren is doing it. He is one of the best.” Puck was the first to report the news of the film.

51,Elon Musk’s Arduous Efforts to Keep Users and Advertisers Hooked to X Platform,Dazeinfo,2023-11-09,"X, formerly Twitter, continues to be in hot waters as 46 of its top 100 advertisers altogether ceased their US ad spending as ...",https://dazeinfo.com/2023/11/12/elon-musk-efforts-to-keep-x-users-and-advertisers-hooked-social-media-platform/,"User engagement on the X platform is another growing concern for Elon Musk. The total hours engaged by X users fell 8% YoY in Q3 2023. This decline was consistent, averaging 6% YoY per quarter from Q1 2023 to Q3 2023. Since Elon Musk‘s acquisition of Twitter, now rebranded as X, the platform’s trajectory has become a central focus among industry leaders and business analysts. X is on a rollercoaster, grappling with challenges like retaining and attracting new advertisers as well as users, coupled with the ongoing task of boosting engagement levels. However, the plot thickens as engagement takes a nosedive, shadowed by concerns about brand safety, policy dilemmas, and the notorious spread of misinformation, prompting advertisers to stage a mass exit from X. According to the latest data from Sensor Tower, 46 out of the top 100 advertisers on X have entirely ceased their US ad spending as of September 2023. This dramatic departure is a far cry from the glory days of October 2022, when engagement and profitability were on the rise. Exploring the post-acquisition journey of X reveals a tumultuous ride marked by a series of advertiser departures from the platform. The impact was immediate; within a month of Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, the platform lost 50 of its top 100 advertisers in November 2022. The ensuing months have seen a continuous ebb and flow of advertisers globally, driven by uncertainty regarding return on investment. As a consequence, the X platform has been witnessing over 50% YoY decline in its monthly U.S. ad revenue since October 2022, according to third-party data provided to Reuters. Zooming out to a broader perspective, although many tech firms have experienced a slowdown in ad growth throughout the past year, X’s advertising business appears to have borne the brunt of this trend. Elon Musk openly acknowledged the severity of the situation, confessing to a staggering 60% YoY drop in X’s U.S. ad business. Insider Intelligence’s projections further underscore the financial impact, estimating that X’s ad business is anticipated to generate $2.9 billion this year, down nearly 30% YoY. The challenges for X extend beyond advertiser relations into the very fabric of its user base. The number of daily active users of X has declined a notable 16% YoY in September 2023. In stark contrast, its competitors, including Snapchat (+11% YoY), Instagram (+8% YoY), YouTube (+6%), TikTok (+3% YoY), and Facebook (+2% YoY), all witnessed growth during the same period, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. The data raises questions about X’s ability to keep users engaged despite all the relentless efforts put forth by Elon Musk and his team. In the third quarter of 2023, X stood out as the only social media platform experiencing a notable 10% YoY decline in its DAUs count. In contrast, Snapchat emerged as the leader in user growth during the same period, boasting an impressive 13% YoY growth in worldwide DAUs. This is followed by Instagram with over 10% YoY, TikTok with over 6% YoY, and Facebook with over 2% YoY growth in their DAUs in Q3 2023. User engagement on the X platform is another growing concern for Elon Musk. Sensor Tower data reveals that the total hours engaged by X users fell 8% YoY in Q3 2023. This decline was consistent, averaging 6% YoY per quarter from Q1 2023 to Q3 2023. In contrast, Meta’s Facebook and Instagram witnessed robust user engagement growth in the third quarter of 2023. This surge in engagement plays a pivotal role in contributing to the company’s ongoing advertising revenue growth, largely attributed to the popularity of Reels. Instagram, in particular, witnessed an impressive 29% YoY growth in total hours engaged in 3Q23, more than double that of competitors TikTok (+13% YoY), Snapchat (+10% YoY) and sister app Facebook (+9% YoY). With competitors thriving and X losing ground in user engagement, advertisers may find themselves questioning the platform’s viability as a lucrative advertising space. As X grapples with challenges in keeping its users engaged, the spectre of user churn has loomed large over the platform in the past year. Surprisingly, the number of churned users on X surged by more than 30% in September 2023 compared to October 2022. This significant increase in user churn, compounded by a decline in engagement and an overall reduction in active users, further complicates the pathway toward effective user monetization for X. Amidst the challenges faced by X (formerly Twitter), there are notable bright spots in its performance. According to Data.AI, global first-time downloads of the X mobile app remained flat in the past year compared to the year prior to Elon Musk’s acquisition of the company. This suggests a level of stability in attracting new users to the platform.  Furthermore, the traffic to Elon Musk’s X profile and posts skyrocketed to a 96% YoY increase in September 2023. This surge in engagement with Musk’s content could potentially contribute to increased overall activity and interest on the platform. Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, has asserted that the platform boasts “half a billion users all over the world showing up multiple times a day.” Although this claim suggests a sizable user base, the challenges of user churn, declining engagement, and the exodus of advertisers underscore the complexity of retaining and monetizing this user pool effectively. In the fast-paced and ever-evolving world of social media, the growth of X delivers a poignant message to all tech companies and entrepreneurs: The success of the company hinges not only on innovation and feature updates but also on addressing fundamental issues of user satisfaction and advertiser appeal. Under the leadership of Elon Musk, X has been rolling out new features consistently, with the ambitious goal of transforming it into a super app. It would be interesting to see how X will strategically overcome various challenges and position itself as the preeminent social media platform in the intensely competitive digital landscape.

While Zuckerberg recently tore his ACL, there was a time when it really looked like he might fight the Tesla founder Musk - as White knew firsthand. 'It was legit,' he exclusively told Adam Glyn. 'I was talking to both of these guys multiple times a week about this. And we literally had a conference call with the powers that be in Italy for the Colosseum. It was very real. Asked whether a future bout between Zuckerberg and Musk could still be in the cards, White was noncommital.  'Zuck blew his ACL, so I don't know,' he said.

Dana White confirmed that discussions over a Mark Zuckerberg-Elon Musk fight were 'legit' A fight between Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk now appears to be dead in the water Speaking on the Joe Rogan Experience last month, Musk said that Zuckerberg had reservations about fighting without UFC branding at the Colosseum. 'And then Zuck pulled out. He used the pull-out method,' Musk cracked, adding that he was willing to fight under UFC rules. In text messages leaked to biographer Walter Isaacson in August, Zuckerberg told Musk, 'If you still want to do a real MMA fight, then you should train on your own and let me know when you're ready to compete.' Musk told Rogan on his show, 'He accused me of not being serious. And I said, 'Listen, at the end of the day, I'll fight you any place, anywhere under any rules.'' The 52-year-old added, 'I'm way bigger than him, it's unfair. I don't think he should fight me.' With White in New York for UFC 295, he offered an update on Conor McGregor, saying the Irishman could return to the octagon next summer.

But to achieve this, it needs a number of volunteers 'willing to have a chunk of their skull removed' so that a robot can insert a chip into their brain and prove that the technology works in people. The implants have so far only been tested on monkeys and pigs. Keen: Thousands of people are said to have expressed an interest in having one of Elon Musk's controversial brain chips implanted into their skull as part of an experimental human trial How it works: The chips are designed to interpret signals produced in the brain and relay information to devices via Bluetooth, with the aim being to enable a participant to control a computer cursor or a keyboard using just their thoughts Elon Musk's Neuralink is working to link the human brain with a machine interface by creating micron-sized devices. Neuralink was registered in California as a 'medical research' company in July 2016, and Musk has funded the company mostly by himself. It is working on what Musk calls the 'neural lace' technology, implanting tiny brain electrodes that may one day upload and download thoughts.  The technology is initially planned to be used to help people suffering from severe degenerative brain disorders such as ALS, but it could have wider uses in years to come. One of Musk's biographers, Ashlee Vance, suggested that Neuralink had received 'an outpouring of interest from thousands of prospective patients' wanting to act as a human guinea pig.  He said that the firm had yet to implant its device in a human but aimed to operate on 11 people next year and more than 22,000 by 2030. It is unclear if participants will be paid to take part.  Neuralink launched a recruitment drive for the first human trials in September, saying it was seeking people with paralysis to test its experimental device as part of a six-year study. But the company has been dogged by controversy in recent years, having sparked ethical concerns and drawn skepticism among neuroscientists and other experts. Vance, who authored the 2015 biography 'Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future', wrote in a Bloomberg report that the ideal candidate for Neuralink's first human trial was 'an adult under age 40 whose four limbs are paralysed'. He explained that it would take a 'couple of hours' for a surgeon to perform a craniectomy and a further 25 minutes for the chip to be inserted by a robot into the area of the brain which controls the hands, wrists and forearms. 'The goal is to show that the device can safely collect useful data from that part of the patient's brain, a key step in Neuralink's efforts to convert a person's thoughts into a range of commands a computer can understand,' Vance added. He said the implant would relay this information to a nearby laptop or tablet. Vance, who said he had visited Neuralink's facilities 10 times in three years, also revealed how Musk had pushed his company to ward off the threat of similar brain-computer start-ups Synchron and Onward. Both have already begun human trials, leading the billionaire to fume last year that the two companies were 'currently kicking our a**'. In response, he is said to have told Neuralink that it needed to pick up its pace 'like the world is coming to an end', according to Vance.  Where it will go: The study will use a robot to surgically place a brain-computer interface (BCI) implant in a region of the brain that controls movement, Neuralink added. Pictured is a scan showing the implant in an animal's brain Safety concerns meant the firm struggled for a while to gain the necessary approval for human trials, particularly with the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA).  Major issues involved the lithium battery of the device, the possibility of the implant's wires migrating within the brain and the challenge of safely extracting the device without damaging brain tissue.  The FDA later granted its approval in May but did not disclose how its initial concerns were resolved.  Despite the controversy, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Musk has grand ambitions for Neuralink, saying the company will facilitate speedy surgical insertions of its chip devices to treat conditions such as obesity, autism, depression and schizophrenia. It could also allow for web browsing and telepathy.   However, even if the device proves to be safe for human use, it would still potentially take more than a decade for Neuralink to secure clearance to commercialise it, experts have cautioned. Goal: Neuralink wants to treat conditions such as paralysis and blindness by linking brains to computers with the help of microchips They say the brain implants will require extensive testing to overcome technical and ethical challenges if they are to become widely available. Musk's company – which was only founded in 2016 – has repeatedly overestimated the speed at which it deliver on its promises. Initially Neuralink wanted to start inserting chips into humans in 2020, before putting this back to 2022. Now it seems more likely that it won't happen until 2024. There was also a word of caution from one of the company's executives in response to Musk's demands. Referencing the fate of SpaceX's first few rocket launches, Shivon Zilis, Neuralink's director of special projects and the mother of two of Musk's children, told Vance: 'We can't blow up the first three. That's not an option here.' 'Botched experiments' by Elon Musk's Neuralink allegedly 'kept suffering animals alive for no reason and malpractice caused monkey's brains to hemorrhage' during rushed brain chip testing, a former Neuralink employee and internal lab notes have previously revealed. The billionaire's startup is accused of violating the Animal Welfare Act with its experiments at the University of California, Davis, from 2017 through 2020, which 'sacrificed all the animals involved,' a former Neuralink employee, who asked to remain anonymous, told DailyMail.com. One case stood out to them - a monkey sacrificed ahead of schedule due to errors allegedly made during surgery.  The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine filed a lawsuit against the University of California, Davis, where the experiments were held, claiming it has to hand over video footage and photographs of the experiments under California's Public Records Act. Pictured is an image of a monkey shown on Neuralink's website DailyMail.com previously obtained Neuralink lab notes that detail how a sealant was placed on the surgical holes, causing the monkey's brain to swell and hemorrhage. 'There was no reason to use it,' the former employee, who worked as a necropsy technician, told DailyMail.com. This incident is among a laundry list of cases brought to light in recent months by former staff, which has led the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to open a federal investigation into Nueralink for animal-welfare violations.

            Latest Market News 


 
      Brace yourselves. Jokes incoming. Elon Musk has announced the introduction of “Grok,” an artificially intelligent chatbot, for some users of X, which the billionaire suggests has a sarcastic sense of humor similar to his own.
   
      Musk, who has owned X — formerly known as Twitter — for a year, announced late Saturday that Grok is being trained by having “real-time access” to information from the platform.
   
      Musk’s AI startup, xAI, which developed the bot, said in a blogpost that it took inspiration from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, a comedy sci-fi novel by British author Douglas Adams.
   
      Grok “loves sarcasm,” Musk posted on X. “I have no idea who could have guided it this way.”
   
      “Grok is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use it if you hate humor!” xAI said in its blogpost.
   
      The bot is still in an early stage of testing, Musk said﻿, but will soon be made available to subscribers of X’s Premium+ service, who, in the United States, pay $16 a month for features such as the once-coveted blue checkmark.
 
      Grok is intended to rival ChatGPT, an AI chatbot released to the public by its maker OpenAI last November to much fanfare. Musk is a co-founder of OpenAI, but stepped down as chairman five years ago partly over disagreements about the co﻿mpany’s direction.
   
Elon Musk sees an AI future where ‘no job is needed’
 
      In its blogpost, xAI said the large language model (LLM) — the type of system used to train AI applications — underpinning Grok-1 had outstripped the capabilities of GPT-3.5, the LLM that trains the publicly available version of ChatGPT, on several measures, including solving some high school math problems.
   
      “It is only surpassed by models that were trained with a significantly larger amount of training data and compute resources like GPT-4,” the company said.
   
      Musk has previously expressed concerns about the speed of development of AI, and the technology’s potential to fundamentally change human society for the worse.
   
      xAI said it expects Grok to rapidly improve as X’s users feed it with more information, which may fuel unease among those critical of Musk’s handling of the platform since he bought the company last October.
   
      The world’s richest person has called himself a “free speech absolutist” and said that, under his leadership, the company would be “very reluctant” to delete content and permanently ban some users.
   
      British far-right figure Tommy Robinson, who has a history of posting Islamophobic content on X, thanked Musk Sunday for reinstating his account, five years after being banned.

57,LGBTQ suicide prevention org the Trevor Project is leaving Elon Musk's X for good,Yahoo News UK,2023-11-10,"One of the most prominent LGBTQ organizations in the U.S. will close its account on X, formerly Twitter. The Trevor Project ...",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/lgbtq-suicide-prevention-org-trevor-170448934.html,"One of the most prominent LGBTQ organizations in the U.S. will close its account on X, formerly Twitter. The Trevor Project announced Thursday that it has decided to end its presence on the platform in light of ""increasing hate and vitriol"" targeting the queer community on X, which Elon Musk purchased one year ago. The organization is focused on suicide prevention and provides 24/7 counseling for young LGBTQ people struggling with mental health challenges. The group noted that X's diminished commitment to moderation informed the decision, contributing to an environment that is ""no longer a safe place for LGBTQ young people -- the group we exist to serve."" ""While the conversation around the benefits and harms of social media platforms is vast and nuanced, we do know that sophisticated moderation tools are essential to protecting marginalized communities and creating safer, more accepting online spaces,"" a Trevor Project spokesperson told TechCrunch. ""The stakes are just too high: 41% of LGBTQ young people seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year--and young people who are transgender, nonbinary, and/or people of color reported higher rates than their peers."" The Trevor Project has made the decision to close its account on X. Read our full statement here. pic.twitter.com/3rWt6Xfz1S — The Trevor Project (@TrevorProject) November 9, 2023 The Trevor Project notes that online hate has a direct, real-world negative impact on the mental health of LGBTQ young people, which it studies extensively. In making its decision to shutter its presence on X, the mental health nonprofit grappled with how its absence might allow hate to further flourish but ultimately decided against ongoing support for the platform. ""Upon deep analysis, we've concluded that suspending our account is the right thing to do,"" the Trevor Project wrote in its announcement. The organization also observed how the ""hundreds"" of pieces of state legislation targeting the LGBTQ community — particularly transgender and nonbinary young people — are a sign of an increasingly hostile political environment. The result of that discourse across politics and social media platforms ""can send the message that LGBTQ people are not deserving of love or respect."" The Trevor Project will continue to maintain its presence on all other mainstream social networks, including Instagram, TikTok and Facebook. In the year since Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, the platform now known as X has rolled back many moderation policies, including ones explicitly designed to protect LGBTQ people. In April of this year, X removed its prohibition against deadnaming and misgendering transgender people (using the incorrect name or gender as a form of harassment). TechCrunch previously reported that the policy change was expected, given Musk's personal views about the transgender community and his public support for anti-transgender figures like Jordan Peterson. Musk's personal views have reshaped X's content moderation policies from his earliest days at the social network's helm. ""The word 'cis' is a heterosexual slur,"" Musk tweeted in late October. The term ""cisgender"" is commonly employed to mean ""not transgender,"" using a Latin prefix to classify people who identify with the gender they were assigned at birth. X's erratic and at times controversial policy changes under Musk have driven other major accounts from the platform over the course of the last year. In April, NPR abandoned its own accounts and their millions of followers after the platform misleadingly affixed the news nonprofit with a ""state-affiliated media"" label. While NPR receives a sliver of its annual budget through federal funding, the label equated the storied news provider with publications like RT, a propaganda outlet that coordinates editorial coverage with the Russian government. Under Musk's leadership, the social media company has also taken aim at organizations that draw attention to the platform's failure to address hate and harassment. In August, X filed a lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate, or CCDH, an organization that publishes research into misinformation and hate speech on social media sites. The group has published a number of unflattering reports about X's unraveling content moderation since Musk's takeover. The Trevor Project directly connects its decision to leave with X's reduced content moderation operations and regressive policy decisions. ""No online space is perfect, but having access to sufficient moderation capabilities is essential to maintaining a safer space for our community,"" the organization wrote.

58,Thousands of people are reportedly lining up to have a portion of their skull removed and one of Elon Musk's brain chips implanted,Yahoo News UK,2023-11-08,"""We can't blow up the first three. That's not an option here,"" Neuralink director Shivon Zilis reportedly warned.",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/thousands-people-reportedly-lining-portion-170836709.html,"Thousands of people are interested in becoming Neuralink patients, a Bloomberg report says. Elon Musk's startup received FDA approval earlier this year to start human trials. The brain-chip startup hopes to implant a device that acts as a ""Fitbit in your skull."" Thousands of people have expressed interest in receiving one of Neuralink's brain implants, a recent Bloomberg report from one of Elon Musk's biographers, Ashlee Vance, says. Vance, who said he visited Neuralink's facilities 10 times in three years, said the company had yet to implant its device in a human but aimed to operate on 11 people next year and more than 22,000 by 2030. Earlier this year, the US Food and Drug Administration gave Neuralink, which Musk cofounded in 2016, approval to launch human trials of its device that Musk has described as a ""Fitbit in your skull."" The FDA had previously rejected Neuralink's bid for human testing in March over safety concerns, Reuters reported, including that the wires connected to the brain chip could move within a subject's head or that the chip could overheat. In September, the company began recruiting for its first human trial. Neuralink said in a blog post that it was looking for people who had paralysis in all four limbs because of a spinal-cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The company says it hopes to eventually make a device that will create a sort of symbiosis between humans and machines and will allow people to send messages or play games using only their thoughts. But first, the company says it hopes to help people with neurological disorders. Vance, who authored the 2015 biography ""Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future,"" said in his report that despite ""an outpouring of interest from thousands of prospective patients,"" the company was still looking for its first volunteer or ""someone willing to have a chunk of their skull removed by a surgeon so a large robot can insert a series of electrodes and superthin wires into their brain."" Musk's biographer said it would take a ""couple of hours"" for a surgeon to perform the craniectomy and then about 25 minutes for the robot to insert the device, along with its ultrathin array of about 64 threads. He said the device would replace the portion of the skull that had been removed. Vance added that the threads were about one-fourteenth the width of a single strand of human hair. Vance wrote that Neuralink had done 155 implantation surgeries using the robot on a variety of animal test subjects, including pigs and monkeys. But, he said, in typical Musk fashion, the billionaire had continued to push for the robot to move faster, as well as for the surgery to be performed without human help. A spokesperson for Neuralink did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication. The biographer said Musk had pointed to the need to combat competition from other brain-computer startups such as Synchron and Onward, which had already begun human trials. ""They are currently kicking our ass,"" Musk said after Synchron implanted its first device in a US patient in July 2022. (In December 2021, one of Synchron's patients in Australia was the first person to send a tweet using only his thoughts.) Vance quoted the billionaire saying Neuralink needed to pick up its pace ""like the world is coming to an end"" to keep up with artificial intelligence and the possibility of an AI being that wouldn't be friendly to humans. Yet while Musk's ""maniacal sense of urgency"" may work at Tesla or SpaceX — where he has initiated sprints and slept on the factory floor to meet deadlines — at least one Neuralink executive has taken a note of caution. ""We can't blow up the first three. That's not an option here,"" Shivon Zilis, Neuralink's director of special projects and the mother of two of Musk's children, told Vance in a reference to SpaceX's first three rockets, which exploded.

       Prepare to see more of Elon Musk. Hollywood has reportedly decided to produce a biopic about the famous tech CEO.  According to Variety, American filmmaker Darren Aronofsky has signed on to direct a film based on Walter Isaacson’s recent biography of Elon Musk. The studio A24 is producing the project after winning a bidding war to option Isaacson’s book.   There’s no word on who will play Musk. No script writers have been announced either. But the Tesla CEO himself seems to have approved of the news, citing Aronofsky’s involvement. “Glad Darren is doing it. He is one of the best,"" Musk tweeted. Aronofsky directed last year’s The Whale, which earned actor Brendan Fraser an Oscar. He also directed critically acclaimed films like 2010’s Black Swan, 2008’s The Wrestler, and 2000’s Requiem for a Dream. Musk might also approve of the film since it'll be based on a biography he authorized. To write it, Isaacson was permitted to follow Musk for two years, attending meetings and walking the factory floors at Tesla, in addition to spending hours interviewing the tech CEO.  The biography, simply titled Elon Musk, covers his childhood, his leadership of SpaceX and Tesla, and his decision to acquire Twitter last year, among numerous other episodes in Musk’s life. But interestingly, Aronofsky is perhaps best known for adding surreal psychological elements to his films. So the Musk biopic might go beyond a dramatic retelling of Musk's life. Isaacson also wrote Steve Jobs' authorized biography, which was turned into a 2015 movie starring Michael Fassbender as the Apple founder. It was directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin.

He is also the wealthiest person in the world currently, with an estimated worth of over $200billion. Isaacson authored several biographies, including that of Apple CEO Steve Jobs, which was adapted into the 2015 movie of the same name. It starred Michael Fassbender as Jobs, Kate Winslet as marketing executive, Joanna Hoffman, and was directed by Danny Boyle. Aronofsky, whose filmography includes, Mother! and Black Swan, is known for his handling of psychological fiction and surreal events. His 2022 film, The Whale, received critical acclaim, with Brendan Fraser winning Best Actor at the Oscars for his leading role. Black Swan, the 2010 psychological horror about the trials and tribulations of a ballet company in New York City, was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Picture, with Natalie Portman taking home the award for Best Actress. A24, who have risen to fame in the last few years with the success of films such as, Everything Everywhere All At Once, Talk To Me and Moonlight, are also known for their production of often psychologically disturbing, bleak, mind-bending movies.

 ‘Soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,’ Musk wrote in a tweet early Sunday. Twitter is set for a rebrand, if its owner Elon Musk is to be believed.  ""And soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,"" Musk wrote in a tweet early Sunday. And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds The change might come as soon as Monday. In a follow-up tweet, Musk said: ""If a good enough X logo is posted tonight, we’ll make [it] go live worldwide tomorrow."" ""It should have been done a long time ago,"" Musk said in a Twitter Spaces audio chat, according to a Reuters report.  The X probably refers to Twitter's business name X Corp. Musk also posted a tweet of a flickering X.   pic.twitter.com/IwcbqMnQtA The rebrand is the latest change to Twitter by Musk since he acquired the company in October 2022 for $44 billion. Since taking over, Musk has made big changes to how Twitter works and has laid off large parts of the company's staff.  In early July, Musk imposed stricter limits on the number of tweets Twitter users can view in a day. Under the new restrictions, verified accounts are limited to reading 6,000 posts per day, unverified accounts to 600 posts per day and new unverified accounts to 300 posts per day.   A new Twitter CEO, Linda Yaccarino, took over the role from Musk last month. Upon her appointment, Musk said Yaccarino would “focus primarily on business operations,” while he would stay focused on “product design and technology.” Log in to access content and manage your profile.

       The latest tech beef is spilling out in the open. On Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman decided to roast Elon Musk’s newly developed Grok chatbot by describing the program as focused on “cringey boomer humor.” Musk was quick to fire back on Twitter/X, saying OpenAI’s large language model, GPT-4, is “about as funny as a screen door on a submarine.”  “GPT-4? More like GPT-Snore!” he wrote in a tweet on Friday. “Humor is clearly banned at OpenAI, just like the many other subjects it censors.”  Altman threw shade at Grok only a few days after Musk introduced the chatbot to counter ChatGPT, which Musk says censors its answers in favor of political correctness. In contrast, Grok is designed to talk about more taboo topics, like how to make cocaine, while offering answers written in a sarcastic style. Specifically, Grok was modeled after the writing in the sci-fi novel The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. But it looks like Altman views the chatbot as a gimmick that can be easily replicated using OpenAI’s own technology.  On Thursday, Altman took to Twitter and posted a screenshot showing him using OpenAI’s GPT builder, which allows you to easily create custom chatbots with a text input. Except Altman also used the demo to troll Grok.  In the screenshot, Altman writes in the input: “Be a chatbot that answers questions with cringey boomer humor in a sort of awkward shock-to-get-laughs sort of way.” In response, the GPT builder tells him: “Great, the chatbot is set up! Its name is Grok. How do you like the name, or would you prefer something else?” Musk and his supporters were quick to hit back. Along with his own criticism, Musk also retweeted or commented on other tweets, seemingly showing that OpenAI’s ChatGPT will refuse to make jokes, even if the user requests it do so. Musk, of course, has a history with OpenAI. He helped found it with Altman in 2015. Three years later, Musk resigned from OpenAI’s board, reportedly because he was developing his own AI project at Tesla. But he’s since accused OpenAI of neglecting its original mission of developing artificial intelligence for the benefit of all of humanity. “OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it ‘Open’ AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft,” Musk tweeted in February.  For now, the spat between the two CEOs may seem trivial. But the entertainment factor of a chatbot can certainly be a draw. In recent months, some users have complained that ChatGPT has lost its fun factor and usefulness since OpenAI restricts it from commenting on certain topics. So Grok’s focus on becoming an unfiltered chatbot could help it stand out. For now Grok is only available to waitlisted users with paid accounts on Twitter/X.

The Tesla CEO, who warned last week that AI was “one of the biggest threats to humanity”, said the competitor to ChatGPT would be made available to premium subscribers on his X platform after testing. Musk also revealed that Grok had access to user posts on X, which he owns, and has a penchant for sarcastic responses. Grok has real-time access to info via the 𝕏 platform, which is a massive advantage over other models. It’s also based & loves sarcasm. I have no idea who could have guided it this way 🤷‍♂️ 🤣 pic.twitter.com/e5OwuGvZ3Z Musk posted an apparent example of Grok’s playful tone with a screengrab of a query to the chatbot asking it for a “step by step” guide to making cocaine. The four steps outlined in the reply include “obtain a chemistry degree” and “set up a clandestine laboratory in a remote location”. However, the chatbot adds at the end: “Just kidding! Please don’t actually try to make cocaine. It’s illegal, dangerous, and not something I would ever encourage.” xAI’s Grok system is designed to have  a little humor in its responses pic.twitter.com/WqXxlwI6ef Musk said Grok, which is in early testing and not available to the general public, would ultimately be released to subscribers to X’s top-tier subscription service, Premium+. Grok is a verb coined by American science fiction writer Robert A Heinlein and according to the Collins dictionary means to “understand thoroughly and intuitively”. Grok has been built by Musk’s new AI company, xAI. Staff at xAI explained the chatbot’s debt to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, the cult sci-fi comedy by British author Douglas Adams, in a blogpost on Saturday. “Grok is an AI modeled after The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, so intended to answer almost anything and, far harder, even suggest what questions to ask! “Grok is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use it if you hate humor!” The xAI team said Grok was powered by a large language model – the fundamental technology behind AI chatbots – called Grok-1. The blogpost said Grok-1 had surpassed GPT-3.5, the model used in the freely available version of ChatGPT, on some benchmarks such as solving middle-school maths problems. However, xAI said it lagged behind the most powerful ChatGPT model, GPT-4. Sign up to TechScape Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion “It is only surpassed by models that were trained with a significantly larger amount of training data and computer resources like GPT-4.” The xAI team said Grok was being made available to a limited number of users in the US as a prototype, adding that “new capabilities and features” would be rolled out in the coming months.According to the Grok website, initial access to the chatbot is being offered to X subscribers under an “early access program”. Musk co-founded OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, but stepped away from the company in 2018, saying he “didn’t agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do”, as well as citing commitments at his other companies. Musk has expressed fears about the pace of development at companies like OpenAI and in March he supported a call for a six-month pause in developing powerful systems. However, in July Musk said a pause no longer seemed realistic and announced the formation of xAI, which he said would build AI systems “in a good way”. Speaking at the AI safety summit at Bletchley Park last week, Musk said AI was a threat to humanity, echoing fears among some experts and tech executives that systems could emerge that evade human control and make decisions that imperil humanity. “I mean, for the first time, we have a situation where there’s something that is going to be far smarter than the smartest human,” he said. Musk then predicted on Thursday that AI – the term for computer systems that can perform tasks typically associated with intelligent beings – would replace all human jobs. Speaking to the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, he said: “There will come a point where no job is needed.”"

Kicking off the third Republican debate, moderators asked the five candidates on stage how they would differentiate themselves from the current fronter, Donald Trump. But Mr Ramaswamy took the opportunity to erupt into a rant about Republicans’ losing streak. “We’ve become a party of losers at the end of the day,” Mr Ramaswamy said, a day after Republicans underperformed in off-year elections. “There is a cancer in the Republican establishment.” Mr Ramaswamy then suggested that Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, was to blame for GOP losses in elections since 2017 when she took office. The RNC is hosting Wednesday night’s debate which is being aired on NBC News. “We have lost 2018, 2020, 2022 no red wave that never came, we got trounced last night in 2023, I think we have to have accountability in our party,” Mr Ramaswamy said before inviting Ms McDaniel on the debate stage to resign. I’m sick and tired of this Republican Establishment that has made us a party of losers. Where is the accountability for years of losing: 2018, 2020, 2022 and now last night? I’m calling on @GOPChairwoman to resign tonight. pic.twitter.com/8hxVqWGlwL — Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) November 9, 2023 The tech entrepreneur then turned his attention to the debate moderators and suggested that Hugh Hewitt, Lester Holt and Kristen Welker were proof the Republican Party is suffering. “Think about who is moderating this debate. This should be Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan and Elon Musk,” Mr Ramaswamy said. “We’d have 10 times the viewership, asking questions that GOP primary voters actually care about and bring more people into our party.” The 2024 candidate claimed Democrats would not allow a conservative news anchor or media personality to host their debates. Mr Ramaswamy then attacked Ms Welker, an NBC News anchor, accusing her of being part of the “corrupt media establishment.” “The Trump-Russia collusion hoax that you pushed on this network for years was that real or was that Hillary Clinton made up disinformation? Answer the question. Go.” Mr Ramaswamy said. Mr Ramaswamy’s spirited start to the debate did not answer moderators’ initial question about how he is different from Mr Trump. Donald Trump appeared to imply that Barack Obama is the current president of the US at a campaign event in New Hampshire on Saturday. Desperate Palestinians have begun attacking Hamas security forces as tensions grow in Gaza over chronic shortages of food, water and medicine. The milblogger said it was due to fewer infantry fighting vehicles, tanks, and armored personnel carriers near the front line. Despite losing the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump came to believe a fringe conspiracy theory that he could be reinstated long after leaving office and before the next election, a new book by ABC's ""This Week"" co-anchor Jonathan Karl reveals.  Trump has long publicly aired his grievances over the last presidential election, frequently repeating false claims that it was ""stolen.""  The idea was not based in law and was clearly unconstitutional, but it was supported by some of Trump's most devout followers, MyPillow CEO Michael Lindell chief among them. Tens of thousands of far-right supporters on Saturday chanted anti-European Union slogans amid a sea of red and white Polish flags at an independence day rally.""If there are new changes in the European treaties, Poland must be ready to quit the European Union,"" said All-Polish Youth leader Marcin Kowalski.

Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, on Nov. 12. SIR – Britain is a largely secular country, but there are occasions that could be regarded as our national holy days. Remembrance weekend – which affirms our history, our identity and our culture – is surely a prime example. Former President Donald Trump continued his attacks on special counsel Jack Smith on Saturday, including a reference to Smith’s family, at a rally in Claremont, New Hampshire.

For Elon Musk, who runs or ...",https://fortune.com/2023/11/10/elon-musk-video-games-are-his-main-entertainment-calm-his-mind/,"Anyone who runs a company needs a way to de-stress. For some CEOs that might mean golf or sailing. For Elon Musk, who runs or owns Tesla, SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter), the main method is playing video games. “It calms my mind. Killing the demons in a video game calms the demons in my mind,” Musk told podcaster Lex Fridman in an episode released Friday. He added later, “I’ve played a lot of video games because it’s my primary recreational activity.” The world’s richest man also said, “My mind is a storm. I don’t think most people would want to be me. They may think they would want to be me, but they don’t, they don’t know, they don’t understand.”  Musk’s longtime companion Grimes, with whom he has three children, told biographer Walter Isaacson that Musk has no “hobbies or ways to relax other than video games, but he takes those so seriously that it gets very intense.”  Among his favorite titles is The Battle of Polytopia, billed as a “strategy game about building a civilization and going into battle.” Players compete to control resources and develop technologies, and they wage battles in order to build an empire. Musk’s brother Kimbal told Isaacson that his famous sibling said Polytopia “would teach me to be a CEO like he was.” The game was also fodder for a series of life and business lessons for Elon, with the first one being, “Empathy is not an asset.” Another favorite of Musk’s is Elden Ring, centered on war and empire-building, which he told Fridman was a “candidate for the best game ever, top five for sure.” He added that it’s “incredibly creative” with “stunning” art.  “Beating hatred in the internal realm,” he added, “is the hardest boss battle in life and in the video game.”  Musk’s game-playing has also preceded some key business decisions. He pulled the trigger on buying Twitter right after playing Elden Ring until five in the morning, Grimes told Isaacson.  Mostly, Musk seems to use video games to get into a certain zone.  “If you play a tough video game, you can get into a state of flow which is very enjoyable. Admittedly it needs to be not too easy, not too hard—kind of in the Goldilocks zone,” he told Fridman. “I guess you generally want to feel like you’re progressing in the game. And there’s also beautiful art, engaging storylines, and it’s like an amazing puzzle to solve.” © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

70,Working For Elon Musk,Hackaday,2023-11-12,"It is possible to name a few such characters in real life — influencing the electricity industry was George Westinghouse, automobiles was Henry Ford, and more recently Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.",https://hackaday.com/2016/08/31/working-for-elon-musk/,"One of my favorite types of science fiction character is found in the books of Ben Bova; a business mogul who through brilliance, hard work, and the force of personality drives mankind to a whole new level in areas such as commercializing space, colonizing the stars, battling governments, and thwarting competitors. It is possible to name a few such characters in real life — influencing the electricity industry was George Westinghouse, automobiles was Henry Ford, and more recently Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. With Elon’s drive we may all finally be driving electric cars within 20 years and spreading out into space with his cheap rockets. Due to the latter he may be the closest yet to one of Bova’s characters. So what’s it like to work for Elon Musk at Tesla or SpaceX? Most of us have read articles about him, and much that he’s written himself, as well as watched some of his many interviews and talks. But to get some idea of what it’s like to work for him I greatly enjoyed the insight from Ashlee Vance’s biography Elon Musk – Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future. To write it Vance had many interviews with Musk as well as those who work with him or have in the past. Through this we get a fascinating look at a contemporary mogul of engineering.  SpaceX looks for more than engineers with top grades. They look for type A personalities, engineers who have excelled in robot competitions, made racing cars, have built unusual vehicles and have been making things all of their lives. They have to be passionate and work well in a team and have real experience in bending metal. SpaceX takes walk-ins but also recruits from colleges and goes through research papers to target engineers with specific skills. When wooing candidates at trade shows and conferences, initial contact is sometimes made in a cloak-and-dagger fashion by handing out a blank envelope containing an invitation to meet in a nearby bar or restaurant. Those who show up find they’re part of a small, select group and are made to feel special. As with other tech companies they go through a battery of interviews, some informal, some challenging with quizzes. For coders, rather than being asked to solve problems with a few lines of code, programs run into the hundreds of lines. Once they make it to the end of the process they are asked to write an essay for Musk about why they want to work at SpaceX. The final step for at least the first one thousand hires was a meeting with Musk; this was for janitors and engineers alike. The meeting could last from thirty seconds to fifteen minutes. Reports are that the interviews run from torturous to the sublime, being asked from just one question to many, and he always gives a riddle to solve. One such riddle is “You’re standing on the surface of the Earth. You walk one mile south, one mile west, and one mile north. You end up exactly where you started. Where are you?” Once you’re hired, you’ll feel like you’re part of a start-up or at least in a Silicon Valley company. Both SpaceX and Tesla started life as start-ups and given their non-stop innovative goals, still have much of that start-up feel. The Silicon Valley feel comes from Musk’s background running Zip2 and PayPal. Robert Downey Junior toured SpaceX’s facility in 2007 to observe Musk as part of his research for his role as Iron Man. He said the facility looked like a giant, exotic hardware store, with enthusiastic employees zipping around working on machines. “Young white-collar engineers interacted with blue-collar assembly line workers, and they all seemed to share a genuine excitement for what they were doing… It felt like a radical start-up company,” Downey said. But start-ups take their toll, causing engineer churn. While Tesla was still in its early days, employees who’d enjoyed the engineering challenges of the first five years were burnt-out. One didn’t think a mass market electric car would ever work. Another left to form his own start-up making electric delivery trucks. Yet another who’d been an important, can-do engineer felt he’d lost his effectiveness when the company grew to three hundred people and didn’t want to suffer through another five years getting the sedan to market. But with Tesla’s strong brand there were plenty of other top talent that they were able to hire, including ones from the automotive industry who knew what was needed to get the Roadster to market. Both SpaceX and Tesla still have a high turnover rate. Most of us have been given impossible schedules by our bosses or been affected by the stereotypical salespeople who make impossible promises regarding how long a project will take. Musk certainly shares this affliction. His initial plan for SpaceX’s first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket was to be just fifteen months after the company was formed, in November 2003, when instead it happened in March 2006. A similar prediction happened for Tesla’s first vehicle. According to one employee, “Elon has always been optimistic. That’s the nice word. He can be a downright liar about when things need to get done. He will pick the most aggressive time schedule imaginable assuming everything goes right, and then accelerate it by assuming that everyone can work harder.” Employees have noticed a special trick Musk uses to get people to meet their deadlines. Instead of saying “You have to do this by Friday at two P.M.,” he says, “I need the impossible done by Friday at two P.M. Can you do it?” When an employee says yes, instead of doing it for Musk, he or she does it for themselves having signed up for it. A cult has formed within the companies around Elon Musk. That’s not too unusual. I’ve worked for a company where one of the founders not only ran the company but still wrote code and led design meetings. A company’s product is usually a founder’s baby and he or she tends to know everything about it. Such founders usually get a lot of respect. Though not all of them have created companies that make reusable rockets or mass market electric cars. That earns extra street cred. Musk gets some of his aura from his ability to absorb information with near-flawless recall, often pumped from his employees. He’d grill them about some component or material. One employee reported, “I thought at first that he was challenging me to see if I knew my stuff. Then I realized he was trying to learn things. He would quiz you until he learned ninety percent of what you know.” During the 2007 and 2008 battle to get the Tesla Roadster costs down one employee stated about presentations, “If you put a number on the projector that does not make sense, he will spot it. He doesn’t miss details.” Musk doesn’t like it when an employee tells him something can’t be done for the cost he thinks it can be done for or on his schedule. If you’re in the way, he’ll take over the project and accomplish exactly what he said was possible, while also running his two companies. It’s difficult to work for someone with this knack without expecting the same out of yourself. Testing the Tesla. By Argonne National Laboratory [CC BY-SA 2.0], via Wikimedia CommonsSpending wisely means being both thrifty and frivolous depending on the circumstances. Musk keeps a tight rein on spending. You can’t blame him since much of the money in the companies is his. But at SpaceX he’s also trying to reach the elusive cost per kilo to orbit to $1000 while at Tesla he’s trying to produce an electric car affordable by everyone. Around 2007 when the Tesla Roadster was still under development and the cost was looking like it would be in the $200,000 range with the manufacturing costs being ambiguous and in need of lowering, Musk gave a speech saying, “we would work on Saturdays and Sundays and sleep under desks until it got done.” When someone objected, Musk said, “I would tell those people they will get to see their families a lot when we go bankrupt.” But he was methodical in getting that cost down, too. In December the motor cost $6,500. Musk wanted it to cost $3,800 by April and costs were plotted and analyzed monthly. There was hell to pay if you fell behind and some were let go. With SpaceX it’s necessary to teach employees to spend wisely because many come from aerospace companies with huge government contracts and have to be converted to more of a Silicon Valley mentality. He teaches them to make trade-offs between costs and productivity, saying that everything is a function of their burn rate. If he thinks a part can be found at a cheaper price then he’ll tell them so. Meanwhile, he once rented a plane to get a part to Kwaj (the Kwajalein Atoll) in the Pacific where they were working on launching the Falcon 1. The plane rental cost ninety-thousand dollars to get the part but it saved the loss of an entire workday, this at a time when the burn rate was a hundred thousand dollars a day. One of the main things that makes all of Musk’s above mentioned foibles worth it is what his engineering staff gets to work on. For those with a passion for aerospace, rather than work at companies that are content to stick with rockets from the 1960s, they get to work on reusable rockets, with a goal of lowering launch costs to make it affordable (for thousands of people to colonize Mars no less). For those wanting to push the envelope on automobiles, rather than work on the centuries old internal combustion engine they get to work on high performance electric vehicles that have features like ludicrous mode, and are also semi-autonomous, are leaders in safety and are innovative right down to the ways the doors open and close. Everyone wants to work on something new, to pioneer the undiscovered, and to be successful in doing so. There’s a lot that goes along with that and the gamble isn’t for everyone, but the rewards for success are something these engineers will carry with them the rest of their lives. Musk has done all this Silicon Valley style with all the usual Silicon Valley company perks. And after all, who wouldn’t want to come to work only to see spaceships that have actually been to orbit hanging from the ceiling and a mission control room behind a multistory glass wall straight out of a Bond movie villain’s lair. I’ve observed that CEOs who have a technical background and actually drive design decisions make a better and revolutionary company than one with a CEO who has an MBA and who strives to keep the company financially viable and make the shareholders happy. There are many examples for the former such as Tesla, SpaceX, Apple, Microsoft etc. There are not many examples for the latter because that’s the point. What do you guys think? Depends… are we talking about TECH companies success or just business success in general? Because MBAs seem to have made huge giants out of banks and other financial institutions… And not that I like them or anything… but in the end those are the companies that rule the world. I meant technology disruptive companies It might not be easy for a CEO to foster a successful company, but it’s a sh!t load easier if all they have to do is produce pieces of paper with numbers written on them rather than something tangible like a tech company has to. Unfortunately ‘success’ is measured in dollars, not in the contribution to the betterment of the species and planet. That’s a very naive view. Just because a bank, charity, building contractor or some other type of company doesn’t produce a piece of software or a laptop doesn’t disqualify them from the notion that they’re impressive. A sweeping statement claiming that tech companies always produce tangible produce is even more naive. And most tech companies do literally nothing to contribute to the betterment of the species and/or planet. An MBA is just as likely as a tech person to found a successful company (tech or otherwise) and there are PLENTY of examples of both MBA’s founding tech companies, and techies founding non-tech companies – all with varying degrees of success. And yeah, success is measured in dollars because we’re in a capitalist society. Even Musk needs to get his companies to turn a profit. Translation: “I’ve only observed a couple companies and am brazen enough to make a broad correlation.” I think your understanding of Apple and Microsoft’s design decisions making a better and revolutionary company is up for debate. While “better and revolutionary” is unarguably subjective, it’s far less subjective to say that Apple and Microsoft’s design decisions (made not by classic MBAs, but by engineers/designers) led to success by most definitions. MS got there by predatory business practices, Apple did it through appealing to fashion and snobbery. Old Apple, the earlier Macs, sold on ease of use, and having lots of software available for certain industries (design and graphics). Apples were sold to “just work”. I’m sure they needed their share of tending, and could go wrong often enough, but the users blamed themselves rather than the machine, Apple had a sortof cult-like thing going, where Mac users would protect the brand, even making allowances for faults. Though a closed hardware system meant faults were easier to prevent.  Post-Imac Apple was basically down to designers like Jonathan Ives, making Apple’s stuff into good-looking products, status symbols. You’d pay more, and get technically less, but it looked cool. Other tech companies have never really mastered that. Because engineers don’t have any aesthetics. Apple put the designers in charge of the products, and made the engineers produce things that fit into the cases.  There’s a market for “designer” products, that are expensive on purpose, just to show that you can afford them. This appeals to everyone, not just Cartier watches and yachts, ordinary people like to be a bit flashy. Iphones are priced just nicely for that. With a ridiculous ripoff 5-year contract, even the poorest people can afford one, and show off for 2 weeks before the next model comes out. The Iphone has the Apple Look. It’s definitely an Apple, next to Mac OS and the Ipod and all the rest, you could tell they’re all family. It looks superior, looks it’s price. But, mostly, it’s not even about that, many people have appaling taste. Really it just has to look like it costs 600 quid. Or people have to know, one way or another, that it costs 600 quid. Costing 600 quid is the Iphone’s primary selling feature, all the rest is secondary.  Me being a geek, I have one of the cheapest Androids, with quad-core and loads of RAM, because I only care about the technical stuff. Looks like any other Android, it’s black and a rectangle. I’d rather have it than anything Apple, even if I wasn’t paying for it. Partly because I don’t trust Apple (though Google aren’t much better), but partly if I’m going to make an impression, it’s going to be “isn’t into conspicuous consumption”. Another sort of message, really, but that’s not why I bought it. In my experience you need both skill sets to make a successful company. Engineering talent makes awesome things possible and more likely, but without the business savvy to keep costs down and charge enough to make a profit the company will go belly up very quickly! Not a hack… but thie article is just perfect. :)
I’d be happy to see Hackaday become a “magazine” a-la Wired or Popular mechanics style but without all the bullshitty stories they usually carry. Past couple years have shown there is more to this site than just “hacks”…

It was the sound of something flying over your head. Am I the first to mention the HyperLoop on this page? No. I am. Visionaries are typically get a bad rep for being cold and calculating.  Usually this is due to them letting folks go when they don’t meet the requirements set.  People have to realize it’s no longer about the people when you work for someone like Musk.  He’s not called a visionary because he’s a philanthropist that cares about you and your family, he obviously has a vision that he WILL achieve no matter how many people he has to go through. Don’t fool yourself into thinking you matter, at the end of the day it’s the product or service you provide that will continue your employment.  A good job will never love you back. Further, if you think that his book is not an autobiography you’re kidding yourself.  It was a marketing move to make Musk seem approachable by the consumer. trends by keywords: https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=2015-04-01%202015-08-01&q=SpaceX,%2Fm%2F0dr90d,%2Fm%2F03nzf1 book release news for the time: https://www.google.com/#q=Elon+Musk:+Tesla,+SpaceX,+and+the+Quest+for+a+Fantastic+Future&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:4/1/2015,cd_max:8/1/2015,sbd:1&start=770 Don’t fool yourself into believing you are unique in your personal needs, juvenile manipulative rhetoric, or professional skill set. Managers literally have heard the same BS a thousand times before you arrived… I’ve fired many smart people for being unproductive socio-paths — you know, the people that tell everyone how great they are, contribute nothing of real substance, and try to exploit other people at work. These “smart” people usually end up back in academics where their behaviour can push a bureaucratic career forwards, or in another company for awhile where their “newness” excuses their lack of ethics.  Elon is notable because most large companies don’t retain a technical person as CEO for very long. He has my sympathy for suffering fools… Successful “visionaries” are often sociopaths. Or perhaps in tech, autistic. Either way, they don’t hold any value in other human beings. And Musk’s trick of getting people to work ridiculous, health-damaging hours “voluntarily” isn’t anything for him to be proud of. I’m sure they know their volunteering, or lack of, will have consequences quite soon in their career.  It’s as much exploitation as when people had to work in cloth mills all day every day. It’s probably as bad for your health. These people need criticising, not lionising. Just because someone’s young and has the time to spare, doesn’t mean they should be induced, or even allowed, to regularly work ludicrous hours, generally for no extra pay. For someone with a life outside work, considered on an hourly rate you’d probably be better off slinging burgers.  If these practices are needed regularly, then Elon needs to take on more staff. If a business is only viable under sweatshop terms, it’s a business that harms society. It has a name: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_and_burn
If no one in your department is over 30, than you’re going to be outsourced eventually anyway. Real talent means people will seek the easiest solution requiring minimal effort.
Unfortunately, 90% of people focus on the minimal effort part, and fiscal responsibility leaves few options. If you own a company, your perspective on things changes rather quickly.
Human beings can be fairly terrible creatures when money is involved. You sound like you’ve been burned before.  You should try to look at it from their point of view.  They have a dream to accomplish, some folks are driven to the point of exhaustion while others want to take it slow and keep pace.  I like to think I’m a member of the former.  If you can’t keep up with the rest of your team, perhaps you need to look elsewhere for employment?  Something that’s a bit more your speed.  Don’t even fool yourself into thinking that your CEO is slacking off like your boss does.  Ever try to focus a company with 30,000+ employees?  Didn’t think so, your problem is with your boss NOT the company. The relationship you have with your job and position is not the fault of your employer.  They have “needs” that NEED to be met(funny how that works).  If you no longer fit those needs, you should be replaced to continue the progress of the company.  As a professional, you should be looking forward so that the needs of the company can be met with your skills as an employee.  Workforce stagnation is a real threat to the bottom line and typically can set off a chain reaction that will cripple if not destroy a good company. If you feel offended because you were let go because you could not perform, just stop.  It’s all business, this isn’t the 1950s where everyone is promised a job.  If you still can’t get past the hurt and anger of losing your position, grow up and put on your “big-boy” pants.  I see 20-30something folks get so butthurt over the dumbest shit.  If you focused half as much effort on finding a suitable job for your skills as you do on whining then you would never have a problem.  People these days have such a sense of entitlement that they feel they are obliged to have a high-paying job(I’m looking at you $15 minimum wage).  There’s no way in hell that it’s fair that some highschool dropout can make close to what I made with a two year degree. Politics aside, there are some extremely bad practices that companies have that cause a huge negative impact on the workforce.  All I can say, do your research BEFORE you apply for that job.  Until then you take your entitlement and rage, and shove them WAAAAAYYY up inside your butthole. So Steve Jobs or Warren Buffet.  Ruthless intelligent businessman driven by flawed ideals.   Deep down we all want to live in a sustainable world and explore space, we just need to be practical about how to accomplish it.  It’s true some Luddites employ empty arguments against ‘green’ technology.  Unfortunately Elon’s obstinate cult views every argument in this light.  Solar, electric cars and space might give you the nice fuzzy feelings but are simply not practical yet.   Not, “That’s why we need to just invest a little more money to make them practical (for perpetuity)”.  Rather “There’s a fundamental flaw which no amount of money will change”.   Solar peaked and still makes less financial sense than just investing money in the stock market.  It only has a ROI because of unsustainable energy credits.   Practical and cheap electric car technology has been around since the 80’s.  The only issue which STILL remains is the battery technology.  It’s too expensive and Elon creating a monopoly (Gigafactory) will not help.   Space is awesome, but all Elon is doing is milking the government here.  The money spent on a single space experiment could fund ten terrestrial endeavors.  It’s a lot like society extorted into spending massive amounts on health insurance to fund pharmaceutical research. Definitely eager to read all the fanboy responses. Whoa, put down the Logical Fallacies for Dummies book and step away from the keyboard. Your criticism of the cult of Musk are toothless without actual fact. Making assertions about what “we all want” isn’t useful (some people don’t give a damn about space exploration, but want reusable rockets to deploy non-sustainable-world burning lasers, for example). Maybe I can help tease out some facts from assertions by asking questions: How are electric cars not practical yet? Given the number of Tesla’s I see on the street, they’re at least as practical as most other motor vehicles. Solar peaked? My solar panels have already paid for themselves, weren’t subsidized by anyone (nor were they cheap because the manufacturer was subsidized), and actually produce more electricity than my household uses. I, like most homeowners, aren’t investors in solar technology companies the way public company shareholders are investors. We just want a product that does what it says it’ll do. Solar panels do that. I don’t give a damn about whether or not investing in solar companies produces a better or worse ROI than investing in the stock market. When I bought solar panels, I did the math and saw that given time, they’d pay for themselves. Today, that window of time is magnitudes shorter than the time it took me to see them pay for themselves. Given that, I think your assertion that solar has peaked flawed. The gigafactory is a calculated gamble. Musk believes that when produced at scale, batteries can be both cheaper and have higher capacity. Whether or not Musk succeeds at this doesn’t matter – battery capacity relative to battery size has been consistently increasing over time. Suggesting Musk will have a monopoly on better batteries because of the gigafactory is an absurd and sensational assertion. Milking the government? Show us how that happens. Give us some facts. How much money is the US government spending on a mission conducted by NASA? How much money is Musk spending on a comparable mission? Tell us, also, how much money health insurance companies are putting into pharmaceutical research? For what it’s worth, I’m not a Musk fanboy. I just can’t resist calling bogus on such a logical fallacy laden sensationalistic rant on why he’s wrong. Frankly, I suspect you’re an oil lobbyist just itching to offer up fossil fuels as the best solution. Whoa!  You begin with a personal attack and end with ‘you must be paid by oil companies.’  That pretty much invalidates everything you wrote in between. Plus, I seriously doubt you could find a solar company that isn’t subsidized or that your panels paid for themselves – unless you use the “new math.” Solar power is subsidized by net metering. The utility company is forced to give you electricity worth at least 11 cents a kWh for electricity they could buy elsewhere for 4-5 cents. The difference is the subsidy. Very few domestic solar power producers actually “eat their own dog food” because they can’t properly utilize the energy when it is available. Your first issue is entirely dependent on local laws. Where are you?  Your second issue would be solved by having a battery bank in the basement. I don’t have a utility company. The excess power I produce is stored in batteries, and what those batteries can’t store, I don’t use. I recognize I might be the exception to the norm, but that’s just a matter of wiring. If other domestic solar producers wanted to, it’s fairly trivial to be completely off the grid. If suggesting that someone park their logical fallacies at the door is a personal attack, I’m guilty as charged. Even if I agreed, a personal attack wouldn’t invalidate anything I’d said. For example, the second half of “That shirt you’re wearing is a terrible color and you’re stupid for thinking it’s a good color” doesn’t mean the subject isn’t wearing a shirt. I never said “you must be paid by oil companies” – I said “I suspect you’re an oil lobbyist.” Suspicions of this kind are fair considering the dearth of evidence and glut of hyperbole I was responding to. There’s no evidence, however, that would motivate me to make the conclusion you made with your words with any sort of certainty. Suspicion is not the same as certainty. I never claimed certainty. As far as “new math” goes, you’re about as wrong as you can be. My panels were paid for using “old math”, when governments had no interest in promoting solar panels and I had to pay full, actual price for an unproven but promising technology. Had I more foresight, I could have waited 10 years and paid half the price for twice the efficiency. Today, I wouldn’t doubt that it’d be hard to find a solar company that isn’t subsidized on some level. 20 years ago the climate (in a number of ways) wasn’t the same. That said, so what if solar companies are subsidized? So what if there are tax incentives for purchasing solar panels? No matter how you look at the data, oil companies get a lot more in subsidies than do solar companies. “No matter how you look at the data, oil companies get a lot more in subsidies than do solar companies.” Only in absolute terms, because oil companies are a whole lot bigger than the whole solar industry is. On a per kWh basis solar literally gets a thousand times more subsidy than oil. It’s a thoroughly disingenous propaganda comparison because it’s looking hundred years back and applying the historian’s fallacy. Plus, it’s an apples to oranges comparison because most subsidies on petroleum products are not producer subsidies, or paying someone to make something they can then sell – but consumer subsidies: most oil subsidies come from countries like Iran or China where the government buys oil and the distributes fuels to its people at a cheaper rate. Plus, a lot of the subsidy isn’t a subsidy but loan/insurance guarantees that are simply given monetary value, while in reality nothing is paid or left unpaid to anyone. A government guaranteeing a loan simply saves both parties money because of lower risk and therefore lower cost of capital. Your statements that solar has peaked and is only sustained by energy credits are false. 1) Solar is still growing YOY. Both module cost and BOS costs are still declining YOY. Verify via multiple industry, NGO, and utility sources and forecasts.
2) Investor owned electrical utilities also have a historical return that is less than the broader stock market. Trivial to verify from publicly available historical stock data.
3) Large solar developers are exceeding historical market returns (6%-8% ROI) on most projects before leverage or tax equity or “energy credits”. Easy to see from financial reports for many companies developing projects.
4) A significant and growing portion of the global PV market is profitable without subsidy and driven purely by the economic and other advantages of some solar on the grid.
5) Most of the global PV industry is not driven by “energy credit” subsidies. Perhaps you can tell me which markets and time frames you are referencing and then I can point out differences between that market and the remaining 80%++ of the global solar industry. People who present these wrong arguments are usually just very out of date in their analysis (or their trusted analyst). Solar power is completely unsustainable in the US without subsidies. The ITC and accelerated depreciation programs reduce the cost of utility scale solar power by 75% to the point where it can be sold to utilities at 5 cents a kWh. The real price is about 20 cents a kWh before transmission, and domestic solar power nearly double that, and domestic producers get net metering on top of the tax credits. Companies that rent solar panels to homes also get to sell “green credits” and carbon offsets on top of the subsidies. The average level of subsidy to solar power by the federal government is $235/MWh (23.5c/kWh) not including net metering where it applies at an average of $110/MWh. In reality solar power is so ridiculously expensive that it would simply not exist if most of it wasn’t paid by the back door. Look, I know it’s not the norm, but you can simply buy panels without any complicated tax credits and generate electricity that, assuming you’ve paid for the panels in full, costs next to nothing. There are maintenance costs (the water you use to hose down the panels when they’re dusty costs something right? As does the 10 minutes of time spent doing it). Some panels break too, (hasn’t happened to me). So it’s not free, but it’s safe to say it’s more free than any other energy source once the panels are paid for. If you’re going to talk about how the subsidization of solar makes it’s unsustainable, you really should also be considering how much the fossil fuel industry is subsidized too. The IMF reported that the fossil fuel industry received over $4T in subsidies in 2011. That number may be higher than $5.3T today. Granted, the size of that industry is huge so you need to break down the cost/kWh just like you did with solar. According to the Institute for Energy research, petroleum is the most expensive energy source at (21.56c/kWh). Without subsidies that number grows as much as 32.43c/kWh. One reason fossil fuels remain “sustainable” is in large part because a third of the cost is paid for by governments. Another reason is that there was a time when it was the only viable option, and trillions of dollars were poured into the infrastructure it still requires. Infrastructure that still costs money to install and maintain. Who knows what the actual cost of petroleum would be if we had to consider all that infrastructure lifecycle cost as part of the entire package (like everyone wants proponents of solar energy to do). Don’t get me wrong though – we wouldn’t have solar energy, let alone any sort of alternative technologies if not for the gains that were made by using fossil fuels. But it’s not ever accurate to say that solar, with a lifecycle of 25 years, is more expensive than the lifecycle cost of fossil fuels. We never break down the cost of the estimated life span of all the infrastructure fossil fuels depend on, and yet, the subsidized cost is still higher than most solar installations’ unsubsidized, equipment-lifecycle-included costs. It’s not the subsidy that makes solar unsustainable. It’s what makes it sustainable – in the market sense. Pull the subsidy and the investments in solar drop to zero because solar power is too expensive to utilize. Of course you can buy cheap panels off of ebay and install them yourself, and wire it up to a bunch of car batteries, but that’s just not scalable to the level of the whole society and you’re hardly counting all the costs, such as the battery replacements.  “petroleum is the most expensive energy source at (21.56c/kWh)” How is it possible then that a gallon of gasoline (33.3 kWh) costs less than $3 when according to your numbers it should cost  $7 just to make? Gasoline is NOT subsidized to the tune of $4 per gallon, not in the US, not anywhere else. I’m sorry but your numbers don’t pass the straight face test. Fuel cost isn’t production cost. To make a car analogy, production cost would include the amortized parts of the car that are specific to petroleum energy generation and meeting regulatory requirements. Specific to power plants, that would also include the cost of getting the oil to the plant and maintaining that infrastructure. Oil isn’t really used in the US for power generation, which is part of the reason the cost is so high. As you’ve said of some other, “I’m sorry but your numbers don’t pass the straight face test.” You are wrong on the costs and the impact of subsidies, probably because you base your thinking on too specific examples. I can accept that. Few people have the time to follow an entire global industry. But even accepting your costs you neglect too much. 1) Those costs are reasonable for a portion of our power system (that we have not yet saturated, but will in about 6 years of current demand). 2) Accelerated depreciation offsets the capital cost of pretty much all power plant and manufacturing equipment  Your opinion about small systems scaling seems uninformed as well. Do you understand where the costs are (hint: not hardware or professional labor!)  Batteries will become necessary when solar power passes natural gas in net kWhs. (aka a very long time from now) You can verify this via the many integration studies carried out by/on behalf of all ISOs in North America, aka the grid undisputed grid management experts. And should we chose we can delay batteries further by updating our antiquated hydro infrastructure and building out transmission. Lastly energy is getting more expensive, which I would expect as a more enlightened society is capable of considering the total costs and impacts. What alternatives are you proposing? Pollution? 100% natural gas? Surely with your obsession on cost, it isn’t nuclear or clean coal. Fanatics are experts at the shell game.  It delays the puncturing of their beliefs. They argue with the cost of the cheapest panels/batteries and power output of the most expensive panels/batteries.  When critics point out that their highly unrealistic scenario includes subsidies, they say… “Well those are required just to deal with oil companies.  I’m certain they could survive without subsidies.”   …even if the removal of subsidies from their scenario tells a different tale. Just because there’s nothing under two of the shells, doesn’t mean there’s something under the third. My biggest gripe with Tesla is use of NCA chemistry batteries to get max performance and putting too much effort in electronic fluff like autopilot and the falcon doors vs working to deliver an affordable electric car.
Most of the rest of the industry is moving to LiFEO4 and NMC chemistry batteries because they’re safer. I’m still amazed at the amount of ancillary devices (screens etc) Teslas use. Give me a set of hardware switches and analog dials that don’t require a screen to operate. removing more electricity dependent devices on the car should be a goal. Consider the battery in a tablet, compared to that in an electric car. The motor uses nearly all the energy. The rest is fluff. And people expect computers in cars nowadays, the thing has to sell after all. Being high-tech and “premium” is what electric cars currently sell on. That will change once the budget models come out and they start competing on price. I think Tesla can’t go to LiFeO4 because the peak current is too low, and they’d have to give up their sporty acceleration, which is 90% of the point of a Tesla in my opinion. As it is,  only rich people buy a Tesla and only due for social bragging rights among their rich friends. “….Solar, electric cars and space might give you the nice fuzzy feelings but are simply not practical yet……” Well, how do they get “practical” if someone doesn’t push the envelope and try to make them as such? Airplanes, automobiles, radios, and televisions weren’t practical at first either. DOS wasn’t practical for the first PC’s made for consumer use either.  No new technologies are practical at first. But you have to ask the question. Is this technology worth being made practical. It wouldn’t surprise me if Tesla’s sold in the $20,000 range with 500 miles on a charge in the near future. AND who the hell drives 500 or even 300 miles continuously any way? most drive 10-30 miles to work a day. Yup, the long-distance thing is a big problem, even though as you say, most people rarely drive more than 30 miles or so.  People need to be able to hire long-range cars when they drive long distances, but somebody who owns a car won’t want to do that. They expect their existing car to do it. Maybe a plug-in range extender, a petrol-powered generator that’s either optional to rent, or part of the car. Making it a rented item would make maintenance easier, as well as the cars cheaper. Perhaps that’s a product that needs to be part of the range. Sell short-range electric cars, and use the savings on batteries to throw in a petrol generator. The generator would be easily removable to keep at home most of the time. After a few years of that, people will start asking for cars without the generator, for a lower price, and be happy just to hire them when needed. The generator would also be handy if it could power your house during blackouts, people with unreliable power (apparently a lot of the USA in summer with their ubiquitous air conditioners) would see the benefit in that. I can’t understand why someone hasn’t brought a 2-wheel towable generator to market that could charge your car while you drive. Seems that a high efficiency engine of some type (turbine?) with a 15-20 gallon gas tank would fit the bill nicely, for extra style points put it into a teardrop shaped housing ala Buckminster Fuller. Well, trailers absolutely murder gas mileage, so that’s probably a good part of the problem. Extending the range of an electric car by turning it into a bad gasoline powered car seems like not a good idea. You’d probably be better off buying a cheap used gasoline powered car. They have, but rather than fitting them to a trailer they put them up front where you’d expect to find an engine. See the Chevey Volt for example. Pure electric drive with an IC backup generator. “The generator would be easily removable to keep at home most of the time. ” I get the idea, and it’s cute, but think about it. The only reason you would leave the generator at home is if the weight savings from removing the generator increases your range. And if that’s true, then it’s not easily removable. The whole “short range/long range” thing is not an easy problem. Well, I mean, it *would* be in a reasonable country with efficient mass transportation, but, y’know. USA. They get practical through innovations from other industries.  Airplanes and automobiles became practical through innovations in metal and engine technology.
Assume the Wright brothers started selling one time use airplanes for the equivalent of a modern Tesla S P85D.  Assume they used the profits to fund research in materials and engine technology, great.  Airplanes are on their way to becoming practical.  Until that research bares fruit, it’s impractical.
Alternatively, if they decided to spend all those profits on one test which only tells us how cold it is 30k feet up (space research)….. might not be the best use of funds.
To your straw-man about no new technologies are practical at first…. yep.  Asking “if this technology is worth being made practical” shows an ignorance in innovation.  So I wouldn’t be surprised that you think Tesla would be selling a $20k car with a 500 mile range and similar performance to their existing cars in the near future.  You probably would also think that’s a bargain. You’re a city boy, you don’t get it. Come out to the West coast and you’ll see commuters easily putting on a 100-200 miles a day in nasty stop and go driving with the A/C on. It would beat a Tesla to death in no time.  BTW DOS was practical from the outset. Primitive but useful and affordable by most families and businesses. Same with transistor radios. In addition to what you’ve said, there’s another issue worth mentioning with regard to electric cars and their limited range. Even if a person doesn’t usually drive more than 20-30 miles a day, they might need the capability to do more in the case of unexpected circumstances or emergencies. Let’s say you’ve already driven to work and back home and your electric vehicle is now plugged in and charging or the next day. Then you get a phone call, your kid got hit by a car walking home from school and has been transported to the hospital in critical condition. The fact you now have to wait hours for your vehicle to charge is a failure of epic proportions. With a fossil fueled vehicle, even if your tank is about empty, it only takes about 5 minutes at a nearby filling station station to solve. Owning an automobile gives people the freedom to travel exactly when they want or need to. The limited range and long charging time of electric vehicles undermines that freedom. For many people, if hey don’t have the freedom to drive wherever they want whenever they want, there’s no point in owning an automobile at all. In my experience, those start-up mentality compagny are not great places to work.
Like a rocket, they go fast, high and are super cool but burn a lot of fuel (young and talented people in that case)
It only pushes you so far, isolating you from your friends, hobbies (other than the one your are practicing) and families that you learn to hate your job, your favorite hobbie and the economy that allow such a compagny to succced. It’s not a surprise that you are a more productive compagny if you crush your employees and throw them away afterward.
You make a lot of money and it’s no your problem to clean up. The older, slower compagnies have to respect their employes (you know, unions…) and gets in a lot of trouble if they don’t.
But in the other hand, their employes are their clients and they take their social responsabilities. The national space agencies use to cost a lot and make expensive products because the employees where a lot, well paid and their workplace was good enough for them to be able to spend their life there. With good organisation and planing and a high enough turnover you can ensure that most of the compagny will reduce the staff in their R&D, hire only fresh out of school kids who will accept the chalenge of doing alone in 3 month (internship?) a project that could have employ a team of 3 during 6 month. (it will be made not perfectly or not with the best practice but who cares?) Our tools are now mature and performant enough to make the “realy hard” and really expensive of 2000 an “almost easy” task (embedded system running linux) and no market has miraculousely appered to bring new needs (don’t say smartphone, tablet or connected stuff that don’t employ R&D outside of apple, samsung and this kind of inaccesible compagny) I don’t say that we shouldn’t chalenge cost, functionalities, delay and so on but we should always be carefull while approching “low cost” : the biggest cost is always the humane one. If this cost is reduce drasticaly, it means than someone lost his job or have really bad work conditions. Elon definitely takes advantage of his employees in this regard.  Make fantastical goals they are passionate about appear achievable so they kill themselves trying to reach it… profit. Engineers have a reputation for meeting deadlines because engineering is about compromise.   Always about compromise.  As the deadline approaches, more is compromised.  Simple as that.  With Elon, he blurs the line between work and life so that engineers don’t realize they are dedicating their own resources to his companies.  I’m not entirely talking about cash, but time and social contacts and relationships. Well, from my own view, I’m glad that I started in a start-up before moving on to an S&P 500 corporation. I’ve never learn’t as much as I learnt back then. Sure, I earn more now in my corporate job, but I really don’t want to miss that time; we got the newest R&D equipment, did cutting edge research and had a close contact to our CEO (who was a scientist himself). The work hours however were not that drastic; rather 40-50 h/week; so honestly I don’t know how it is to work 70+ hours. I’d just say, corporations really should take more start-up people in their higher ranks; the mindset is so different (thinking out of the box, etc). I’m really glad you said this. I haven’t worked in a startup — but observationaly I believe that being in a startup is like boot-camp for breaking entrenched assumptions and practices. Some would package this into the buzzword “disruption”. It is carried with the people who go on to successful careers that don’t gobble up 100% of their free time but stull allow them to be highly productive. A caveat is that most startups fail. They’re disruptive, but not successfully so, and the people involved end up learning nothing useful except one way how to not run an engineering venture. I’d have to argue that learning “how not to run an engineering venture” is actually a very useful thing to learn. If you’re gonna see the bad in everything, of course it’s gonna suck. Spacex already disrupted the industry even causing the stalwart industry giant ULA to look into reusable LVs and cutting edge stuff such as integrated fluid on their upper stages.
The greatest thing they have done  probably is removing the giggle factor from the concept of trying out of the box things in aerospace. I disagree, haveing been involved in a failed “startup”  I learnt heaps. Spent a lot of time designing, dealing with suppliers researching the market, producing prototypes.  I ended up working for free when for a while once the money ran out till I needed to pay my bills – I ended up been paid in test gear and tools so it was not all a loss, for me at least. I don’t have numbers but known some folks who know. SpaceX turnover is crazy high. It could be pressure from expectations, like demanding that software is finished on a tight schedule, or a miserable work culture. Apple could be that way when Steve Jobs started popping into cubicles and demanding “Justify your job to me right now”. However, the results have been spectacular, which would seem to mean communications, cooperation, and testing run well and people bail out before problems develop.(Opposite of Microsoft). I would not mind knowing more about the low-level company culture. Well, aside for the bit where Tesla is continuously failing to meet Musk’s promises or make a profit, and the technology they’re pushing proves to be worse than advertised with cars catching on fire or the “autopilot” decapitating people – which according to other reports was because Musk got the numbers and decided “it’s good enough” while the actual engineers who tested it were losing sleep in the knowledge that someone’s gonna die sooner or later. It’s engineering to the minimum. There’s other curious anecdotes from the engineers, such as that the parking assist in the Model S doesn’t work right if you park it close enough to a ledge, because it’s not programmed to identify a cliff drop behind the car. That’s just another “close enough” from Musk, who is now updating the sensors after they did turn out inadequate.  Musk is also bailing out his own cousin by buying the uncompetitive Solarcity company on investor money. He seems to be so full of hot air that alone is enough to keep the whole thing afloat. http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/28/technology/elon-musk-tesla-autopilot/index.html “”I came in with this mentality that Elon had: I want to go from on-ramp to off-ramp and the driver doesn’t have to do anything,” says Meadows, who was fired from Tesla two months later for performance reasons. “The last two months I was scared someone was going to die.”” (…) “In another anecdote recounted by two sources, Musk was told that the sensors used for Tesla’s self-parking feature might have difficulty recognizing something as small as a cat. Musk is said to have responded that given how slow the car moves in this parking mode, it would only be dangerous to “a comatose cat.”” (…) “”It’s hard to believe a Toyota or a Mercedes would make that same tradeoff,” says David Keith, an assistant professor of system dynamics at MIT Sloan School of Management who studies new technologies in the automotive industry. “But the whole ethos around Tesla is completely different: they believe in the minimum viable product you get out there that’s safe.”” Toyota did worse things than Tesla.
http://www.safetyresearch.net/blog/articles/toyota-unintended-acceleration-and-big-bowl-%E2%80%9Cspaghetti%E2%80%9D-code That’s by incompetence, not by intent. “But the whole ethos around Tesla is completely different: they believe in the minimum viable product you get out there that’s safe.” This sounds like it is straight out of Stanford B School via Y Combinator. It is part of how to bring a product to market efficiently. For only time in the real world will provide the kind of information necessary to perfect the product. Prototype ASAP, adjust and reiterate in that cycle until one hits the sweet spot. It is very Silicon Valley and it works quite well with plenty of real life experience and high octane research to back it up. Pretty harsh opinion on Solar City. Another argument is that the market just does not understand the business plan, which is consistent with the entire industry… Look no further than volatility in the yield-co market or other privatization plans. Solar City is just one company among many struggling to convince the market of their long term thinking. They have the advantage that Elon has another company for which the market does understand the long term plan. There is no benefit a public corporation that can’t convince shareholders of its plan. As for SolarCity being uncompetitive? vs who? No other major residential solar installer I know is doing better. The market likes them even less… They’re all going to get gobbled up by private equity anyway at this rate. It’s not harsh. Couple years ago when they announced their new big factor, Musk promised 55 cents per Watt. Trouble is, the Chinese are pushing 40 cents a Watt and the factory is still not running. Solarcity is obsolete and uncompetetive, and bound to go the way of Solyndra. Elon buys the company off of his cousin even though he’s got zero actual profit from any of his ventures. He’s running entirely on investor funds. He hasn’t got any sustainable business that would stand by their own merit without continuous influx of new investment capital, and that’s why he’s running his mouth faster and announcing new goals and new products quicker than his companies can produce or sell them: as long as he keeps the hype mill turning, the money keeps coming. When he stops, the house of cards falls down. Elon Musk has a stronger reality distortion field than Steve Jobs – at least Steve had to actually sell something, whereas Musk is just promising things. And a great deal of what he does is gimmicks and marketing – just like Steve Jobs. For example, what is the “Ludicurous mode” in the Model S? It’s simply a software bypass that allows the motor inverter to temporarily work beyond specs to deliver high acceleration, provided the battery is at least 95% full. It’s a one shot trick that is perfectly useless even as a toy – consider that you can’t use it if you have already driven the car a couple miles. So the new 100D model can do 0-60 in 2.5 seconds? Yes, if you first top it up and then push it to the starting line. Dax, they could alwasy make it even more Ludicrous mode by strapping two small SRBs to the next model. I’d call it Tesla Model Space-X… “Elon buys the company off of his cousin even though he’s got zero actual profit from any of his ventures.”
Any?  Either you are uninformed or… deliberately spreading the seeds of doubt. Is your short position unsustainable or are you just trying to get a bump? For SpaceX is solidly in the black and a cash machine, with launches booked well into the future, each with a fat margin. Additionally, there are the other investments in startups you know nothing about. Furthermore, SpaceX is one of the largest holders of Solar City paper. Given Musk controls SpaceX Unlike other CEOs, Musk is all in as The Major Shareholder, takes only minimum wage, has his desk in the middle of the action, sleeps in the factory as necessary and works 9-10 hour days. He knows his product better that his competition knows their’s.Tesla gets more done in two weeks than the competition does in 2 years. Currently the machine that makes the machine is being redesigned to function much more efficiently. This goes for all the factories. This will include the use of AI throughout the Tesla organization in a comprehensive manner that will touch every facet.  For someone who had never made a mass production automobile until he actually did it, Elon is doing quite well. Being CEO of two disruptive, fast growing companies that make exceptional products, made by incredible people, simultaneously, is an exceptional feat in anyones book. From founding of the company to making 100,000 unit per year, Tesla will hit the mark well before Porshe AG first hit theirs.   Yes they are sinking a ton of cash into the companies, but they are not pissing it away, but rather investing it in the future.  Just because you don’t fully understand what is going on, nor seem to care to,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             does not make Musk wrong or inept. I am long Tesla and admire the work Mr. Musk is doing. Their main business is installing panels not making them and they are competent and competitive in this area. Solar city can always buy panels from China at 40 cents a watt (soon high 30s). Manufacturing modules in the US is a terrible idea but not enough to sink the company. So the guy is basically running a Ponzi scheme of sorts.  If the money stops his whole business empire blows up. @zerg
You could say much of silicon valley today is a pretty much ponzi scheme with companies that do not have a positive cash flow being valued far more then their actual asset value. You’re never going to get 100% safe. Providing the Tesla Autopilot is more safe than a human driver, and they catch fire less often than a conventional car (which happens rather more regularly than you think) then they’re on the right track. That’s not to say that Tesla should stop improving things, but what they have is suitable for the market already. Tesla cars haven’t been on the roads for that many years or that many miles, and they’re already catching flame in comparable numbers to cars that have been neglected for 20-30 years. Consider, the cars that catch flame on the roads are made 11 years ago on average. The Teslas that catch fire were made last year, and at least one Model S burst into flame straight out of the car dealer’s lot when they were test driving it. The problem is that Tesla is knowingly using a particular lithium battery chemistry (NCA) known for its high energy density but marginal fire safety. They’re “cheating” there as well, and hoping that the cars don’t light up too often, much the same as how Ford knew the Ford Pinto was defective but neglected to fix the issue because they calculated it would cost more than the cost of the lives. “Providing the Tesla Autopilot is more safe than a human driver” That depends on what you mean by “a human driver” and what you mean by “safer”. Given the Elon Musk’s beancounting ways he will argue that the car is safer than humans when it has less accidents per mile than the average driver.  However, a small number of drivers are responsible for the majority of accidents on the roads, which means most people are actually better, safer drivers than the “average driver”. It’s mean vs. median, and you know what the corporate marketing department is going to pick. It also goes to show how immature and how far behind the hype the technology still actually is. If Tesla were to use the safer battery options, they would halve the driving range of the cars and have to drop the 2.5 second “ludicurous mode” accelerations and be more like Nissan Leaf or the e-Golf – i.e. totally uninteresting. Driver safety is easy to measure in a statistical sense. How many accidents are there per million miles driven. The Tesla autopilot is not doing badly on that scale.
As for fires, they happen in new petrol (gas for the US readership) vehicles also. In the US alone the fire services are called to over 200,000 vehicle fires per year. The NTSB doesn’t think that electric cars are more prone to fires than petrol, and if they are involved in one then there is much less chance that they will explode. Carrying around large amounts of stored energy has dangers, be it in the form of petroleum spirit or batteries. Determining which is safer isn’t easy.  It heavily depends on what variables are included (reference “P-Hacking”).  Elon’s Autopilot claim is HEAVILY dependent on P-hacking.  He’s not comparing his own car’s accidents with/without Autopilot…. which would be MASSIVELY better than him comparing his car’s Autopilot record to the average poor person’s car.  He’s also ignoring the fact that most people don’t trust Autopilot, so they’re actually monitoring the driving and regularly correcting mistakes. People *aren’t supposed to trust Autopilot yet*. Despite the fancy name it’s currently enhanced cruise control plus lane holding. It can handle things like idiots trying to pull into your lane when you happen to be in the way, cars in front of you stopping suddenly etc, but it isn’t supposed to be a fully automated system and should be supervised when it is in operation. Read the details on it, not the headlines. “The Teslas that catch fire were made last year, and at least one Model S burst into flame straight out of the car dealer’s lot when they were test driving it.” The French couple test driving the car that last caught fire said they can’t wait to take delivery of their new Tesla when asked for their reaction.  According to “Consumer Reports” 97% of current Tesla owners said their next car will be a Tesla. There is no other manufacturer of anything, much less cars, that can report that kind of customer loyalty. German auto manufacturers would die for a number even close to that.  Furthermore, Tesla has spent ZERO dollars on advertising! Despite this, the 370,000 advance orders of the Model 3 made automotive marketing history when people around the world camped out, to line up, to put down $1,000.00 cash for a car they would not receive for years to come. The response surprised even the most optimistic.  The Model 3 is designed for manufacturing which means efficient manufacture of an excellent product. “Everything from the tooling required to achieve certain shapes for stamped body panels to the ideal joining technologies for different types of metals had to be agreed upon ahead of time, unlike Model X, where design changes were made on the fly, adding complexity and causing manufacturing delays.” Forbes.com: http://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2016/08/04/tesla-model-3-manufacturing/3/#4e4946e35679 “The Model 3 is the first car Tesla is creating that is designed to be easy to make. This is really a fundamental difference,” – Musk  The new Fanuc robots on the Model 3 line will be GPU-powered AI robots that can learn by trial and error. This deep-learning technology was developed by Preferred Networks an AI company Fanuc has invested in.  In addition, the entire Tesla enterprise will be supervised by a proprietary AI that Elon is teaching. Recently he helped fund the nonprofit Open AI with the help of some of his PayPal friends and others. He has also invested in other AI companies on his own. Consequently, Tesla will become the most efficient automobile manufacturer in the world. This will happen very quickly after they have fine tuned the manufacturing, which is in process now. Regarding the competition, the incumbent auto manufacturers have a major problem to deal with if they are to go all electric. That is their dealer networks. For dealers make their money from the repair shop. An electric car won’t need near the maintenance if well made other than tire and wiper blades. Consequently, one can not sustain a dealership on that kind of diet. Hence the dealers are an albatross around the necks of the manufacturers as they will not go quietly into the night. Call it what you may, but Tesla is obviously doing something right and that has obviously gotten under your skin. Hence all the BS you are attempting to spin.  Who do you work for?  Because you obviously have an agenda. This comment about “good enough” seems absolutely prescient only one day later, given the SpaceX explosion that just happened. There’s a reason they call it rocket science. Rockets are barely controlled explosions. Stopping one from blowing up, going off course, breaking up under the strain etc isn’t easy. Until we find out the cause I wouldn’t be hasty to mock. …unsure why you thought I was mocking. I have a good friend who has been there for about 5 years. Talking with him, he puts in 80+ hours a week (sometimes working 7 days a week). He also stated that the average person lasts about 18 months (that was the number they told him when he was hired on). They said if he could last longer than 2 years, his chances for advancement and movement in the company would be drastic. And true to form, he stuck it out and has moved up quite a bit. That said, he is single, has no hobbies, and at one point didn’t even have an apartment because he literally never slept anywhere but the office. I work in a small aerospace research company and spacex is pretty notorious for chewing up engineers and spitting them out. A lot of people work there just for the resume builder and then leave, and spacex knows this but to them the human capital is just a disposable commodity. Interestingly, there are infinity points on the earth where you can walk a mile south, then a mile west, then a mile north and get back to the same place. Uh. No? You’d end up a mile west, with some error for how bumpy the Earth was in one direction compared to the other. Er. I get it now. I posted another comment which hit the moderator queue. I feel dumb now.
If it’s still in the mod queue it can be deleted. Or not, I can be a lesson to future generations. Wouldn’t you end up a mile east of where you started? Unless you were at the north pole. Suppose you were near the South pole. You could walk a mile South to where the latitude is 1 mile in circumference, walk a mile West, then a mile North and end up in the same spot. You could do the same by walking to where the latitude is 1/2 mile in circumference, or 1/3, and so on. So there are a number of latitudes on the Earth where you could pull that trick off. Except if you’re at the South Pole, there is no “south”.  All directions are North.  The correct answer has to be the North Pole. Sorry, I missed where you said “near” the South Pole.  Your answer is correct as written. I said “near”, not “at”. Start at the South Pole. Walk North 0.159 miles. Put a red flag there. At that point, a 1 mile circumference circle will bring you back to your starting point. If 0.159 is the radius, twice that 0.318 is the diameter, and pi times that gives a circumference of 1 mile. Walk North of your red flag by 1 mile. Put a green flag there. Now: Starting at the green flag, walk South 1 mile, to your red flag. You are 0.159 miles North of the South pole, which is *near*, but not *at*. Walk 1 mile West and return to your 1st marker. Walk 1 mile North and return to your 2nd marker, your starting point. So you can do it if you start 1.159 miles North of the South pole. And any other point that makes the circumference of the circle an integer fraction of a mile. And that, my son, is the only correct answer. Well, I think you have to differentiate between geographic North Pole and magnetic North Pole. (i.e., you would use a magnetic compass at the magnetic North Pole and longitude/latitude at the geographic North Pole) But as long as you were consistent in your choice of directions it would be the same result.
Nice riddle. Actually I don’t think it matters. You could define any point on Earth as the “North Pole”, and it’d work. Simply because of the definitions of “North” and “South”. Please elaborate? You’re walking a the perimeter of a non-euclidean triangle. Walking on the outside of a sphere, using polar coordinates. No, I’m pretty sure the answer is the north pole.  If you pick an arbitrary point other than the North pole, you will end up some distance west of where you started.  How much west depends on the latitude you started at. How about starting at any point on the latitude that is exactly a mile north of the latitude (in the south pole) which is exactly one mile in circumference? Now how about starting a mile north of the latitude that’s half a mile in circumferance? or 1/3 of a a mile? Yes, that’s a pretty interesting case.  I would consider that an “extra credit” answer.  I’d be impressed if someone came up with that on the spot.  I just considered it a variation of the riddle that goes “You are in a house with four windows on each of the four walls, which all face South, a bear walks by. What colour is the bear?”.   Both answers appear in this thread: http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/3668/what-color-was-the-bear.  I suppose in either case you could claim that if there’s a bear, it would have to be a polar bear. +1  It is an old question. You don’t think about right angles, but the directions given and look at a sphere. I mile South on a great circle that passes through the South pole, then an arc 1 mile long on a 1 mile radius West circle (doesn’t matter how long this leg is), then 1 mile North on a great circle. And you are back at the North Pole. They don’t teach differential and projective geometry much anymore, if at all, unless you take a course in General Relativity that is not too abstract. Nerd sniping at it’s finest! I think the answer they’re looking for is “exactly where you started”…. you’re getting caught in the trap of actually thinking about it. Amen, as I think no one has considered that the planet earth never stops ‘pulsing’ – therefore there is no ‘same’ spot to return to. Hmmm if I started on the surface of the earth I’d end up on the surface of the earth.  No where were coordinate  asked for. Don’t over think these  kinds of questions. No the actual quote – “You’re standing on the surface of the Earth. You walk one mile south, one mile west, and one mile north. You end up exactly where you started. Where are you?”
Says it in the question, you end up exactly where yo started. …When a North-going Zax meets a South-going Zax
Who’s in whose way? There’s something to be said for not working for a D-bag. Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Steve Balmer and Henry Ford (just to name a few) are/were all very successful, and are/were abominable human beings. Especially Ford, an unrepentant antisemitic conspiracy theorist and mass publisher, this comic book like bent villain just wanted to provide good working conditions and good automobiles exclusively to Lilly white Aryan American families and screw those scheming Zionist Jews.  He was a great inspiration to the Fuehrer and his all white Autobahn and Volkswagen ubermench only utopia and again screw(well this time genocide 1/3 of world Jews) those imaginary Jewish world controlling emperors. The others in the list are just varying degrees of douchey ego-maniac .01%ers who also lead some more or less neat projects or products.  Lets just say they have not helped inspire literal created the definition genocide and world war with their hate incitement, incitement which could never be made up by any number of great products or good treatment of staff. Exactly. I have no interest in making a rich bellend richer at the expense of my work/life balance. Most people are glass half full, or glass half empty people. If you want to be one of the 0.1% revolutionaries, demand to know why the fuck the glass isn’t full to the top. Glass with the bottom half empty, more exciting that way. ;) Ford at least pushed for the 40 hour work week even though it was primarily in the interests of profit as more then that the hourly productivity dropped off ,there were more errors,accidents, and absentee rates went up.
Plus they would time to go out and buy some of the very products they manufactured. When I think of a SF counterpart to Elon Musk, I think of D.D. Harriman, not anything from Ben Bova. Am I alone in this? I enjoy Heinlein characters but haven’t read anything with D.D. Harriman in it. Judging by the outline I just read, he sounds about right. I had in mind Bova’s Dan Randolph from Empires Builders and a few other of his books. You’re not alone.  Poor Harriman came to a sad end. Yay! D. D. Harriman was my first thought. (sarcasm) Who is this Bova upstart, anyway? (/sarcasm) Not Lord Vetinari? Oh yes, he uses the sign up principle, like one can volunteer to run the Post Office or  leave through that door over there. Battling governments.?  The guy wouldn’t have made a dime without his expertise in acquiring continual government subsidies.  He certainly has given Hillary enough donation money to insure he gets free taxpayer money the next 4 years too Guess who gets more money in welfare, the poor or the rich? Go on, think about it, take your time. Here in the UK we are planning to spend a few £Billion on High Speed Rail, then another 20 or so Billion on a new nuclear power plant. We should contract both projects out to Elon Musk, we would have a real futuristic transport system and I guess micro power generation in every ones homes. . . . or you would just be out of money and Musk would be richer. He works his ass off, while you were writing this. Certainly he doesnt give a rats ass about being wealthy, otherwise he would have stopped working after selling paypal. Why not fund Reaction engines Skylon as it looks like it could give Spacex a run for their money.
Actually might even dominate the sub 15ton payload market. As long as the human history goes slaves were ruled by psychopaths.
We want to think about ourselves as the pinnacle of social order (after all most countries are practicing more or less defined democracy).
The truth however is that we are slaves ruled by psychopaths.
Founders, CEOs, Board members, Investors Politicians or Lawyers – all of them will pass psychopaths lacmus test and most of them are living in the financial wealth ‘bracket’ not accessible to regular slaves.
We think we are free but in reality we are nicely segregated to our pay brackets and forced to play the given roles in the ‘theater of life’.
If we do not play by the psychopaths rules we suddenly find ourselves without the basic necessaries of life ( not much different than slavery in Syria 3 thousands years ago). And then … we have exceptionally smart people supporting the practices mentioned in this article.
Are those smart people going to be proud of being enslaved for 18 months ?
Do they really have some sick desire to be ‘taken advantage of’ (avoiding profanity) than thrown away mental end emotionally scared for life ?
Do they really think that ‘supper slave for the 18 months’ is something that is going to help their carers later on in life ? Why do we feed and encourage that particular psychopath ?
Why do we lineup for the product of his sick mind ?
Which one of us (slaves) will take trip to Mars ?
How many of our kids will be gainfully employed by the ‘mega factory’ and out of those few ‘lucky ones’ how many of them will have time to procreate ? The only way to fight psychopath in our current economical situation is to fight them back on the principle of supply and demand.
As long as we continue demanding their products we satisfy their sick brains and encourage them to be more dangerous. I read your lyrics. What is the melody? made me grin :) You can kinda chant it along to “The Wall” Have you read “The Psychopath Test” by Jon Ronson? He interviews Bob Hare, who invented the current checklist used to diagnose psychopathy, he spends a lot of time talking to him through the book. Then Jon goes to interview someone who faked mental illness to get out of a prison sentence. Which is exactly the sort of thing a psychopath would do! So they’re keeping him in the mental hospital for his psychopathy, not for the stuff he pretended to have.  He also interviews Toto Constant, leader of a Haitian death squad (FRAPH), now living a modest life in the USA, and, believe it or not, collecting McDonalds Happy Meal toys as a hobby.  As well, he interviews Albert J Dunlap, famous corporate “downsizer”, who was given the jobs nobody else wanted, because he actually enjoyed firing people. He made hundreds of people unemployed to prop up share prices. While it lasted. Dunlap’s also known for bringing companies into ruin, and the SEC estimated he claimed $60 million in earnings for one company which were fraudulent.  Anyway, what’s interesting is Jon, a fairly meek and unassuming bloke, hesitantly asks questions from the Test to Dunlap. He comes up positive for many of them. But he redefines the questions, explaining away psychopathic qualities as actually being good and necessary in business. He may be right.  Bob Hare thinks psychopaths in power, political and business, among others, are responsible for most of what’s wrong in the world. Free-market capitalism seems to favour the characteristics these people have. They rise to the top in a system that’s made for them, and then use their power to change the system to be even more favourable.  I think I agree with Bob Hare. Unfortunately it’s not the sort of thing you can boycott. Not until they start putting CEO psychological evaluations in company reports. There aren’t many ethical businesses you can conveniently patronise, who would you buy your medicine or energy off? It’s the system as a whole that’s fucked, really fucked. Same with politics, that’s even more depressing. Things aren’t going to get better til we start giving more of a shit about our fellow man. And the media makes it it’s business to separate us all with fear and alienation.  Partly it’s a few very bad people, mostly it’s millions of ordinary people behaving in a sub-par way. As a species, we’re not capable of living well in a modern world. Luckily most of us can’t afford Musk’s “products”, which he isn’t making any money off to begin with since he needs taxpayer subsidizes to exist. As for those stupid enough to work for him and get burnt out emotionally physically, they deserve it. Look any company that pushes 70-80 hour work weeks and has almost a 100% turnover every two years is a disaster. It tells me management and planning are non-existent and someone is making promises they can’t keep.  And they certainly don’t care about their employees. What sane person wants to work for a company that treats them like disposable tissue paper? If you have the talent to be noticed by SpaceX, you can probably get a very nice paying and easy job at Lockheed or some other giant.  It won’t be as sexy as SpaceX but they won’t burn you out and kick you out the door a year from now. We need to encourage innovation and discourage stagnation.  Today those who innovate tend to rapidly increase the wealth accumulated, while those who stagnate, squat.  We tax income, and more income we tax more, not less.  Our policy must change.  We need to tax wealth itself rather than the accumulation of wealth.  The more rapid the accumulation of wealth, the less aggressively should such accumulation be taxed.  Our goal is we need to encourage the accumulation of wealth for our aggregate economy and discourage wasteful use of our country’s accumulated wealth.
The best trained people to invest wealth are going to be the people now in possession of wealth.  Wealthy families tend to stay wealthy for a reason, and that reason is family lore and evolved family practices.  This confounded communism and augers against it forcefully.
With the capitalist victory in the Cold War, the spread of peace and stability has encouraged investment world wide, and this has driven up the value of capital.  Strangulation of capital, limiting investment, is to be avoided.
America has divvied up our economy into favored and unfavored.  Solar and wind investments are favored.  Coal mining is unfavored.  Markets do this automatically.  Government does this democratically.  The value of externalities (positive–like employment and negative–like pollution) requires social responsibility that government fiat alone can forge.  The cost of pollution is underreported, however, in that human sociopathy as well as environmental pathology are also among those costs, and thus the entire burden of institutional care may be laid at the door of polluters.
So, do I argue for a flat tax?  No, but progressive taxation should progress only to the limits of consumption. Purchase taxes rather than sales taxes should be progressive at the margin and on an annual basis, hopefully the fiscal year to avoid grinching Christmas.  It is counterproductive to sales tax the poor at the same rate as wealthy people anyway.  Our computational and communications technology could be utilized to enable this scheme without too much difficulty.
That would help Musk to do what seems now impossible.  The rest of us must help him, not hinder him.  He’s working for all of us. We must help him like you must help me.  No more. He’s working for himself more than anyone.   Any notion of his altruism is unfounded and purely based on image. OK, do it your way. Well, he’s lost a lot of money in his effort so far.  Perhaps he sees something in power that we lack perception for, eh? you would be on the north pole — riddle answer “They look for type A personalities, engineers who have excelled in robot competitions, made racing cars, have built unusual vehicles and have been making things all of their lives. They have to be passionate and work well in a team and have real experience in bending metal.” Well, I’m screwed! I’d hire you for your character alone, as skills can be learned.
;) People who don’t listen to their own internal concerns are far more dangerous. In a world where people only care about how thin their next phone is and what dick moves Donald Trump and Kim Kardashian are up to, Musk is a breath of fresh air,  While working for him is obviously not for everyone, anyone applying for a job there would be well aware from the outset that it is a very high pressure environment, just like anyone joining the army would be aware there will be 20 mile runs and a good chance of getting shot at. No company is going to create a ground breaking product by employing people who sit on their arse and moan about how hard the work is. My 10 cents. There’s a difference between sitting on your arse, and having an expectation of actually working your contracted hours, with perhaps a humane and reasonable amount of paid overtime. Working 90 hours on a 40 hour contract isn’t “being cooperative”, it’s a ticket to a heart attack. As well as 50 precious hours of your short life that you’ll never get back.  Exploitation like this is excused, and even praised, far too much these days, and it encourages more exploitation. If Musk wants to sleep at his desk, that’s his prerogative, and it’s him who’s going to make the billions of dollars. If he needs more man-hours, hire more men. That’s how people used to do business. Being paid well and doing something you believe in passionately is a luxury and if you know what you are in for then there is nothing wrong with how Elon optimises his workforce, but If you want to have a life too, yeah good luck with that. I’ve done the long hours thing, crazy contract rates and non-stop +30 hour days, never again, it damages you in the end and nobody cares once you are no use to them. Better to live a good and complete life and find meaning in it your own way, forget about the big money too because all the best things in life are free, you just need the time to enjoy them. My Take On Musk: A guy who is in to science and tech but has “social currency” so can actually get capital and cooperation unlike the awkward mathematician or hacker that people naturally have a problem with for being too “arrogant” or “snobby”. If he can persuade the world to science, objectivity, and conservatism instead of careless consumerism and illiteracy than more power to him. He seems to have the personality and look to handle the political part.. I can’t tell you how many times in life things I did were passed over and used years later when someone else pushed it because I was awkward and naturally can’t persuade and social-network. It sucks. ““You’re standing on the surface of the Earth. You walk one mile south, one mile west, and one mile north. You end up exactly where you started. Where are you?”” I don’t consider that a terribly hard riddle to solve.   When I was interviewed many eons ago for a software dev company I was asked some silly questions too like “why are man hole covers round”. Naturally my answer was “that’s the shape of the people who go in them”.   I still got the job  ;-) The book goes on to say that the importance in asking the question is not so much to see if you give the correct answer but more to see how you describe the problem and go about solving it. Much like your answer to the man hole cover question probably told them something about you that they liked (sense of humor? geometric thinking? doesn’t overthink?). They’re round cos if they were square they might fall in diagonally. Round cover can’t fall in a smaller round hole.  The answer to Elon’s riddle is “The North Pole”. Only place on Earth where that’s possible. It’s a pretty stupid job interview question though. It’s like the riddle of the Sphinx, if you know the answer, it’s obvious. If you don’t, it’s not gonna occur to you. I’d sooner use some sensible problem than a daft novelty. I suppose if an applicant were crafty he could pretend to have worked the North Pole one out from first principles. Taking credit for someone else’s work, he’d therefore be ideal for management. Either an elevation with ridged topology or a trick question since a mile is the same town in the same county in the same state. I like the man hole question. The mistake many make is to think their answer is the answer. There are a plethora of reasons man holes are round, and someone who, unprompted, identifies many of them and is openly accepting of there being more will tend to be the type of thinker to:
avoid mistakes based on their assumptions or interpretations,
be more creative, not stopping at the first/easiest solution, and
have an eye for detail, analysing the seemingly trivial
The only issue is it is a question many candidates have encountered. Other reasons off the top of my head:
They are the shape to cover manholes which are round because cylinders support pressure from surrounding earth most efficiently.
They can be rolled making them easy to move.
They maximise hole area for perimeter, minimising costs of lip insert and manhole walls
Stress concentrations are minimised and loading is optimised for brittle cast iron.
Maximum span is minimised, lowering strength requirements.
Manholes are constructed from sewer pipe segments, no need to stock a different shape of wall. Any more people? “Altruism doesn’t exist, only enlightened self-interest.”–anon
Anyone who thinks that working for Elon Musk is a noble undertaking has rocks in his head. “Altruism doesn’t exist, only enlightened self-interest” Ayn Rand is a dead huckster who sold sociopathy as something normal and noble to those buying confirmation bias. Enlightened self-interest is naught but sociopathy. Sociopathy is a flaw not an evolutionary bonus or strength.  Musk is not practicing “enlighten self-interest” unless making the world a better place is so. Sure he pushes people hard, but it is not to make more money, but to get the job done efficiently as he know time is not on our side regarding anthropogenic global warming. People are capable of doing much more than they believe they can.  If the cream of the crop has rocks in their head jawnhenry, where does that place you. For it is evident you would never cut it in one of his companies. In anticipation of a response regarding the so called “Myth of Scientific Consensus About the Cause of Global Warming” I give you the following: http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus.htm Well it does show that you have no qualms about screwing young workers over and not paying them for OT.  Really it says a lot of bad things about Musk. He’s unable to manage, plan, allocate resources in a sensible manner and instead works in full panic mode to make up for it. Been there, seen it.   The main products of such companies are the human wreckage that comes out the back door.  And what does Musk produce in terms of real products – a toy for millionaires. .  The fact a bunch of geeks at hackaday are ecstatic over a company that burns out people like them all the time is just pathetic.  What a selling point to young people wanting to be STEM workers – get hired by a company that puts you on salary so they don’t have to pay you OT, work you 80 hours a week, that ruins your healthy, your social life and emotional well being so as to make some billionaire even richer and then after 18 months lays you off because you’re burnout. I’m sure being a mental and physical wreck looks GREAT on your CV. Ayn Rand didn’t even live up to her own psychopathic ideals. She went on welfare when nobody was buying her shitty books, and appointed someone else with power of attorney to claim medicare on her behalf. Power of attorney despite, presumably, being as sane as she ever was. So she took government help when she became in need, but did it in a ridiculous, pouty, childish “it’s not ME it’s that damn attorney, pass the morphine” manner.  Everyone else is lazy and deserves starvation, but when Ayn needs help it’s she’s just taking back HER share of taxes that she paid decades ago. Just like everyone else did. Welfare is acceptable to Ayn Rand as long as you oppose the principle of welfare. She realised this truth at the point that she needed to claim welfare. In a world that wasn’t filled with coddled basement-dwelling arseholes and corporate psychopaths, she’d be just another dead crank that nobody had heard of. Like she was 20 years ago. Far as global warming goes, you’re probably doing the world a much bigger favour going vegetarian and not keeping pets, rather than just offloading your car’s energy usage to distant power stations. Might make the Middle East a bit calmer though, when it’s no longer economically worthwhile for the West to constantly interfere with them. Ayn Rand proposed an easy way out by having singular culture and production value for individuals.. It’s not “sociopathy” because she wasn’t publicly a SJW or something.. It just wasn’t politically correct or what Joe the fry-cook wanted to hear.. I dare say social-majorities especially in the US actually practice her teachings though they just don’t apply it to their own groups.. Funny thing is most of the gated community idiots who are pushing her pseudo-philosophy these days don’t meet up to the standards according to it that they like to think. If you sold products at a corporate level you’re a salesman not a scientist or artist or rationalist. Be careful what you wish for “philosophers”.. If we are to judge purely on behavior like actual rationalists then Musk seems to be a positive force in the world.. If not then who is? Who is he relatively worse than in any aspect? not a hack Why isn’t anyone talking about the HyperLoop?  Isn’t it one of Elon Musk’s most fantastic inventions?  Wouldn’t his engineers be able to overcome all of the limitations of travelling at the speed of sound inside a pipe? I thought the Dyson Sphere was a pretty cool idea, but I’m gonna hold my opinion until they actually build one. Probably because HyperLoop a dud.  SolarCity is a dud – so broke that Musk is trying to bail it out using public investor money from Tesla to keep that SolarCity dud afloat.  The only problem is that Tesla loses more money than it makes too. The whole setup is a house of cards that smells a lot like a ponzi scheme.  The problem Musk has is that now he has a harder time hiding his magic math Enron accounting scheme to prop up all these businesses. Elon Musk is no more a genius than any other sucker who won the big lottery.  The big difference is that Musk now believes he’s gods gift because he managed to win the lottery by selling an over inflated dot com bubble business to some suckers before the crash.  He then managed to use this winnings to start another business that got bought out by PayPal and then won the lottery a second time after eBay overpaid him for PayPal. Musk’s genius isn’t technical.  He’s a master manipulator and scam artist who manages to sweet talk people out of their money.  SpaceX?  Government supported.  Tesla?  Public company.  He’s a genius at skimming off the top and selling his ideas to people too eager to give away money. He’s riding the front of the wave in another tech “dot com” bubble.  His businesses lose more money than they make because they are not viable real world businesses without a bunch of sugar daddy’s to bank roll his tech fantasies.  The Tesla car is pretty cool.  I’d just rather spend $150K on other things that would make me money. Like shorting Tesla stock. One of the most clear, concise descriptions of the subject I’ve ever seen.
Thank you very much. Interesting how this “sucker” “who won the big lottery” is capable of doing what he did, while you are a just a despicable sucker yourself, whining about people who worked their ass off to get where they are now. I would be more interested in hanging out and learning from a “genius” like Dr. Dan Gelbart than a megalomaniac like Musk.  Gelbart became a billionaire selling his business to Kodak.  The difference in Gelbart’s business was that it was actually profitable and viable.  If I ran my business the way Musk and the tech bubble start-ups do I would have been bankrupt long ago.  And guess what…I’ve been running a business for 20 years now.  I didn’t win the lottery and don’t have billions in the bank but I’m 90% confident that I’m probably living more comfortably that you are. If a person wins the big poker stars tournament two times does that make them a genius?  Is that person guaranteed to win again?  Thats not the way luck works. Don’t confuse hard work and success.  I’ve seen a lot of really hard working people never get a fair shake.  And I’ve seen real dumb@sses get hit with a money stick and still pilfer it all away. Sure Musk is smart.  He’s blowing millions of dollars daily of other peoples money and people keep giving him more.  Donald Trump is smart – went bankrupt 4 times (he destroyed other peoples wealth then walked away), doesn’t pay his fair share of taxes, and now he’s using his “business acumen” to fix the economy for everybody and is running for President. Yes I guess I’m despicable. I would certainly hope if I was a multi-millionaire I would not be asking anyone to work for me for free. I would hope I would be somehow making lives better instead of making lives worse. Elon is certainly free to make aggressive schedules for his company but the fact that he does this and relies on his employees to work massive, constant hours of unpaid overtime is what sickens me. He could hire more workers rather than ask for his employees to sacrifice all life outside of work and work for him for free so he can make more money.
His companies are his dream, his passion, and all his hours worked go into increasing the value of his company, but his employees at SpaceX put in thousands and thousands of unpaid hours, working 70 hours a week or more, and have no meaningful relationship with any other human beings other than those they work with, and make less money than engineers doing the same job at other companies working 40 hours a week who actually spend time with their families and kids and friends and have a life outside of work. His dangling carrot of compensating employees with private company stock or stock options for when the company goes public sounds good but Elon does not see the company going public until after completing their Mars mission, which is decades away.
Somehow Elon’s greed and demands for free labor are not viewed the same as a classic sweat shop, but thats what they seem to be to me, cloaked by the fact that the business is “cool”.
Making a fortune by demanding people work 70 hours a week for you for 40 hours of pay is not improving anyone’s life but Elon’s.

A recent report by Reuters suggests that SpaceX employees are resorting to drastic measures, including using stimulants and IV fluids and even sleeping in restrooms, to keep pace with Elon Musk's ambitious project timelines. What Happened: The investigation by Reuters, which examined the period from 2014 to the present, revealed over 600 work-related injuries at SpaceX. The investigation also uncovered the extreme lengths to which employees have gone to meet the demands of their work. Some staff members have reportedly taken Adderall without a prescription and have been found sleeping in the company's bathrooms to save time. Former SpaceX employee Travis Carson shared insights with Reuters about the work culture, highlighting the staff's long hours and challenging conditions. The company's welders, in particular, often dealt with high temperatures while working on rocket machinery, leading them to seek IV treatments to endure the heat and continue working, he said.  “SpaceX’s idea of safety is: ‘We’ll let you decide what’s safe for you,’ which really means there was no accountability,” said Carson. “That’s a terrible approach to take in industrial environments.” Also Read: Elon Musk Shares Bizarre List Of Elon'Jobs In The Future,' Causes Stir on Twitter With approximately 13,000 employees, SpaceX has reported many worker injuries over the past nine years. The number of injuries could be higher than reported, as the company has not consistently submitted comprehensive reports to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, according to Reuters. Furthermore, injury rates at three major SpaceX industrial facilities far exceeded the space-industry average last year.  The report also highlighted concerns regarding workplace safety practices at SpaceX. For instance, Musk's preferences for certain colors reportedly led to the repainting of machinery and discouraged the use of standard safety vests. Several SpaceX workers told Reuters that Musk discouraged employees from wearing yellow-colored clothes for safety purposes because he does not like bright colors. The employees also said that Musk would play around with a novelty flamethrower during visits that the billionaire made to SpaceX sites. While SpaceX did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment, the company previously informed OSHA that it provides adequate safety training to its workforce.

72,Twitter CEO Says She Wishes Elon Musk’s AI Would Talk About Sex With Her Kids,Yahoo,2023-11-11,"Linda, Linda, Linda Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino regrets that she was not able to use her boss Elon Musk's wildly vulgar AI chatbot to teach her kids about sex. You know, the regular workplace fodder.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/twitter-ceo-says-she-wishes-223031178.html,"Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino regrets that she was not able to use her boss Elon Musk's wildly vulgar AI chatbot to teach her kids about sex. You know, regular stuff for an exec to say publicly! To back up for a second: Grok, as the AI is called, was released this weekend to a small group of test users. Whereas other chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard have been criticized by many on the right for being too liberal, Grok is specifically designed to be anti-""woke,"" like a seasoned Twitter troll; it has the humor of a 13-year-old boy, and yet somehow a 53-year-old man. Unsurprisingly, the limited users with access quickly took to X-formerly-Twitter to share the AI's sometimes tame-ish, sometimes deranged outputs with their followers. One of those posts, shared to X on Tuesday by Babylon Bee staffer Ashley St. Clair and reshared by Musk, featured Grok's response to the question of how babies are made. ""Oh, dear human, you're in for a treat! Babies are made through a magical process called 'f*cking,'"" the AI responded. ""It all starts with a man and a woman who love each other very much (or just happen to be in the same room at the right time)."" It then launched into a few sentences about sperm finding eggs — referred to as a ""tiny, microscopic version of 'The Amazing Race'"" — and explaining intercourse as a ""special hug called 'baby-making.'"" While we wouldn't read this and immediately think ""grade-A sexual education,"" Grok's baby-making depiction got a five-star parenting review from Yaccarino. ""I wish I knew Grok during the Birds and the Bees talk with my kids!"" the girlboss-in-chief tweeted in response, adding a ""smiley face with hearts"" emoji. https://twitter.com/lindayaX/status/1722023260806680589 Users flooded the comments section, with some agreeing that Grok's sex ed is the way to go. ""Omg, this is def going to make life a lot easier,"" one netizen replied. ""I'm not there yet with my little one but now I can prepare."" Others, however, pointed out the not-so-kid-friendly parts of Grok's explanation. ""I don't think you'd want to tell your kids its called “f***ing” though,"" another X user suggested. To be fair, Yaccarino was probably joking — she just tweets like a mom whose inexplicable emoji use and inability to convey tone through text always throws you for a loop. But, hey, give it a year or two, and we wouldn't be surprised if the unmoderated banking-dating-hiring-everything app X does launch Grok's Dickipedia, where the AI teaches the youth about Earthly repopulation. More on Grok: Elon Musk's New Chatbot Is Astoundingly Vulgar The biggest news stories this morning:  Elon Musk’s new AI company, xAI, launches Grok the chatbot, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried found guilty of fraud, Washington DC pilots free AirTags scheme to tackle car theft. An AI chatbot from Elon Musk's xAI will be released to X Premium+ subscribers once it's out of beta, the CEO tweeted. He also shared screenshots of conversations with the AI, and said it is designed to have humorous responses and has access to real-time information from X. On the eve of the one-year anniversary of Musk taking over Twitter (now X), the company published a retrospective blog post examining how it has fared under the new management.  X's CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a blog post that overall users spend 7.8 billion active minutes every day.  Similarly, the figure of 1.5 million sign-ups per day is also lower than Musk's 2 million per day sign-up figure from a year ago. As Instagram Threads is leaning away from news, according to statements made by Instagram head Adam Mosseri, its competitor X appears to be doubling down.  The all-hands on Thursday was the first that both X owner Elon Musk and CEO Linda Yaccarino attended together, after her hiring in May.  On the call, the execs touched on a number of initiatives planned for the company, including Musk's well-known desire to shift X to become an ""everything app,"" which focuses on creators, video, payments and even hosting users' money and securities on its platform.

73,Darren Aronofsky to direct new Elon Musk biopic for A24,Far Out Magazine,2023-11-11,"Darren Aronofsky is set to make a movie biopic about the Tesla director Elon Musk, who also founded SpaceX. The filmmaker has ...",https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/darren-aronofsky-to-direct-new-elon-musk-biopic-for-a24/,"The American director Darren Aronofsky has confirmed that he’s working on a biopic about the businessman and managing director of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk.  The screenplay for the new movie will be based on Walter Isaacson’s biography of the controversial public figure released in September. After a hotly-contested bidding war, A24 came out on top, with the indie company due to produce and distribute the film in the near future. The company previously worked with Aronofsky for the release of 2022’s Oscar winner, The Whale. Isaacson’s previous biography about the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs was made into a movie in 2015, directed by Danny Boyle, which starred Michael Fassbender, Seth Rogen and Kate Winslet.  Musk, the South African-born American entrepreneur, is best known for co-founding the payment service PayPal and the automobile company Tesla Motors, as well as forming SpaceX in 2002. After purchasing Twitter in 2022, Musk has become a figure of great controversy, rebranding the social media to X whilst bringing all of the right-wing commentators back to the service after they were previously banned.  Meanwhile, this will be the first foray into real-world drama for Aronofsky, who has long preferred provocative dramas often involving religious themes, including 2010’s ‘Best Picture’ nominee Black Swan, 2014’s Noah and 2017’s Mother.  2022’s The Whale won two Oscars at the 2023 Academy Awards, walking away with statuettes for ‘Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling’ and ‘Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role’ for Brendan Fraser. Aronofsky’s work has long attracted attention at the awards shows largely thanks to the provocative nature of his films and scripts. Despite this, the filmmaker has never won an Oscar, only being nominated for ‘Best Director’ in 2011. Take a look at the trailer for The Whale below in preparation for Aronofsky’s upcoming biopic."

Hopkins, who found fame as a candidate on BBC’s The Apprentice, was suspended permanently in 2020 on the platform, then known as Twitter. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was banned in 2018. Both personally thanked Musk, the billionaire owner of X, in their first posts since rejoining the social media site. Musk has faced criticism for allowing disinformation to flood the platform under his tenure. A report published by the EU in the September found X to have the highest ratio of disinformation posts of all large social media platforms. Hopkins, who used to have more than 1.1 million followers, was removed to “keep Twitter safe”, according to the company at the time. She has faced public opprobrium in the past for comparing migrants to cockroaches and claiming that a photograph of a dead Syrian boy lying on a beach, which had prompted a wave of compassion across Europe, was staged. Robinson, who has a string of criminal convictions, has in the past been accused of posting Islamophobic content on Twitter. In 2018, the now Metropolitan police commissioner, Mark Rowley, said there was “no doubt” material posted online by Robinson, the former leader of far-right group the English Defence League (EDL) had contributed to the radicalisation of the Finsbury Park mosque attacker Darren Osborne. “He had grown to hate Muslims largely due his consumption of large amounts of online far-right material including, as evidenced at court, statements from former EDL leader Tommy Robinson, Britain First and others,” Rowley said. Hopkins’ first post on the platform since 2020 read: “Thank you @elonmusk. And thank you to all the Twitter family who have brought Tommy & I back to @X. “Know this. You are not alone. We are many. And we are stronger together. The fight back for your freedom is on.” Robinson also thanked Musk, adding: “I’ve been censored, attacked, slandered and imprisoned for shining a light on uncomfortable truths that our government wish to hide, the public are now aware I was telling the truth. We have lots to do.”"

He was speaking to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak during an unusual ""in conversation"" event at the end of this week's summit on AI. The 50-minute interview included a prediction by Mr Musk that the tech will make paid work redundant. He also warned of humanoid robots that ""can chase you anywhere"". The pair talked about how London was a leading hub for the AI industry and how the technology could transform learning. But the chat took some darker turns too, with Mr Sunak recognising the ""anxiety"" people have about jobs being replaced, and the pair agreeing on the need for a ""referee"" to keep an eye on the super-computers of the future. This video can not be played Billionaire Elon Musk tells the British prime minister that AI will be smarter than the smartest human Tech investor and inventor Mr Musk has put money into AI firms and has employed the technology in his driverless Tesla cars - but he's also on the record about his fears it could threaten society and human existence itself. ""There is a safety concern, especially with humanoid robots - at least a car can't chase you into a building or up a tree,"" he told the audience. Mr Sunak - who is keen to see investment in the UK's growing tech industry - replied: ""You're not selling this."" It's not every day you see the prime minister of a country interviewing a businessman like this, but Mr Sunak seemed happy to play host to his famous guest. And if he seemed like he was enjoying it, it should be no surprise - he previously lived in California, home to Silicon Valley, and his love of all things tech is well-documented. In a hall that size, Mr Musk was difficult to hear and mumbled through his elaborate musings about the future, but refrained from any off-the-cuff remarks that might have caused Downing Street embarrassment.  The event was held in front of invited guests from the tech industry in a lavish hall in central London's Lancaster House. Unusually for an event involving the prime minister, TV cameras were not allowed inside, with Downing Street instead releasing their own footage.  Some reporters were allowed to observe - but told they could not ask questions.  The pair discussed the potential benefits of AI, with Mr Musk saying: ""One of my sons has trouble making friends and an AI friend would be great for him."" There was also agreement on the possibilities AI presents for young people's learning, with Mr Musk saying it could be ""the best and most patient tutor"". This video can not be played âLike having a very smart friendâ: Musk on impact of AI But there was a stark warning on the potentially ruinous impact it could have on traditional jobs.  ""We are seeing the most disruptive force in history here,"" Mr Musk said, before speculating: ""There will come a point where no job is needed - you can have a job if you want one for personal satisfaction but AI will do everything. ""It's both good and bad - one of the challenges in the future will be how do we find meaning in life."" Amid all the philosophising, there was little in the way of new announcements about how the technology will be employed and regulated in the UK - aside from the prime minister's promise that AI could be used to improve the government's own website. Mr Musk was one of the star guests at this week's summit - but it briefly looked like the event with Mr Sunak might be a little overshadowed. Hours before it was due to begin, Mr Musk took to his own website X, formerly known as Twitter, to take a swipe at the summit. As Mr Sunak was on his feet giving his final press conference at Bletchley Park, Mr Musk shared a cartoon parodying an ""AI Safety Summit"". It depicted caricatures representing the UK, European Union, China and the US with speech bubbles reading ""We declare that AI posses a potentially catastrophic risk to humankind"" - while their thought bubbles read ""And I cannot wait to develop it first"". But in the end, the pair appeared at ease together, and Mr Sunak in particular looked in his element - perhaps even slightly bowled over by the controversial billionaire, who he called a ""brilliant innovator and technologist"". From the cheap seats behind the dignitaries of the tech world, it was hard to put your finger on who was really the powerful one out of this pair.  Was it Mr Sunak as he asked the celeb tech billionaire questions? Or was it Mr Musk, who did much of the talking? Either way, both men hope to have a say in whatever our AI future has in store for us.

 ‘Musk did not enable it, because he thought, probably correctly, that would cause a major war,’ Walter Isaacson says. Elon Musk biographer Walter Isaacson took to social media to try to “clarify” an excerpt in his upcoming book that detailed how Musk purportedly thwarted a planned Ukrainian drone strike. The extract, which describes how Musk told his engineers to disable Starlink satellite communications near Russian-occupied Crimea last year to frustrate an attack on Russian warships, had faced fierce backlash since being published on Thursday. “The Ukrainians THOUGHT coverage was enabled all the way to Crimea, but it was not,” Isaacson said in a post on Saturday. Instead, he said, military officials asked the billionaire entrepreneur to enable coverage for the drone attack. “Musk did not enable it, because he thought, probably correctly, that would cause a major war,” the author added. But the original excerpt published in the Washington Post said that Musk “secretly told his engineers to turn off coverage within 100 kilometers of the Crimean coast,” causing Ukraine’s drone subs to “lost connectivity and washed ashore harmlessly.” Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Musk’s decision allowed the Russian fleet to attack Ukrainian cities. “This is the price of a cocktail of ignorance and big ego,” he said in a social media post on Thursday. Russian officials, meanwhile, praised the move. The supposed sabotage happened just as relations started cooling between Ukrainian forces and Musk, who had been helping keep Ukraine online since the beginning of Russia’s invasion through his Starlink satellites. Musk, fearing the conflict could become another world war, had started restricting the Ukrainian military’s use of Starlink in Russian-controlled regions and for drone control.

In response to a Twitter news coverage profile complaining about the decision — which has already taken effect on Xbox consoles — he said: ""I will look into this."" The SpaceX, Tesla face says a lot of things on the social media site so whether something actually comes of it is up in the air, but Musk is aware of Sony's decision. Once integration with Twitter is disabled on Monday, 13th November 2023, PS5 and PS4 owners will no longer have the ability to upload captured screenshots and videos directly from their consoles. Workarounds include using the PS App on your smartphone, or transferring your pictures and clips to a USB stick and then uploading them to Twitter via a PC. The alert sent out to PS5, PS4 users said: ""As of November 13, 2023, integration with X (formerly known as Twitter) will no longer function on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 consoles. This includes the ability to view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so)."" It'll be interesting to see how Sony handles and updates the PS5 Profile features henceforth, as your Twitter uploads are built into a section at the bottom. That is unless Elon Musk finds a way to talk Sony out of it, of course. [source x.com] About Liam Croft  Liam grew up with a PlayStation controller in his hands and a love for Metal Gear Solid. Nowadays, he can be found playing the latest and greatest PS5 games as well as supporting Derby County. That last detail is his downfall. Comments 45  Let Him Cook this time  Absolute man child  I think if Sony were interested in negotiating a better deal (for example the API costs) they would have approached X before announcing this removal. The fact that they have already publicly announced this means that they are likely beyond the negotiation phase.  Twitter was always kind of a hellhole, but Musk taking it over has somehow made it worse. It’s a shame, because so many people use it as their main method of communication and contact with the world. But I definitely understand why PlayStation would pull away from it, so as not to be seen as associated with the platform in its current form. Elon might offer up a truckload of money to keep the integration, but I don’t think Sony would accept it — and I don’t think they should.  @thedevilsjester I agree. This could be more than just an issue with API costs. It could be about brand image. The fact that new owner Elon spends all his time courting the most vile people imaginable on that platform may also have something to do with it  He's always ""looking into"" things  I don’t see what he could do if Sony has their mind made up. If the decision was just a veiled threat it wouldn’t have gone this far. I do wish Sony would have replaced Twitter with another service though - Mastadon, Blusky, Spoutible, Threads - rather than just cutting us off posting. Yes I know YT is still there but it really isn’t the same.  The less connections that Twitter/X, or whatever it's going by at the time, has to anything whether it's tech, news, media or society in general, the better for everybody.  Sony should demand that he pays them to continue supporting his platform.  Translation: ""I'll throw some money at them because I have no actual business sense"" Guy is a goofball.  Elon's used the phrase 'looking into this' so often on Twitter that it's practically become a meme at this point so I'm highly skeptical he's actually going to do anything about this myself. Still, it'd be nice for him to prove me wrong for once (and I can't emphasise 'for once' enough here).  For once, a rare Elon win IF he actually keeps his word. But then again, this Elon we're talking about, a man child who constantly makes the worst changes on Twitter because one or two people made fun of him.  For someone claiming to get rid of ""all the bots"", he sure seems to post like a bot a lot of the time himself. How many times has he posted this exact same comment under tweets? That aside, Sony wouldn't have made this decision without some sort of discussion already having taken place with Twitter. Evidently they were not happy with the outcome of that discussion.  Interesting, Concerning, I'll look into this … Elmo is just a broken, boring record at this point. Disregard.  Removed - trolling  Jesus I always knew the man had an overly inflated ego but this is just ridiculous 🙄  @SoulsBourne128 ""if he keeps his word"" Why break the habit of a lifetime?

Silence Musk! Down with this sort of thing!  Whats he gonna do, Hold Sony to ransom? A fool of a man  @Blaze215 I think it's more to do with the fact he's a lying, narcissistic egomaniac with a very thin skin who has no one but his own selfish interests at heart. A man that only steals other people's ideas and fobs them off as his own.  Musk could have just, you know, not torpedoed Twitter. He spent $44B for the company only to eliminate its brand recognition and reduce its value by about ~$24B.  @JB_Whiting Nah mate, haven't you heard, he's the people's champion of free speech! Or something. Also the richest man on the planet, so yeah, very much a man of the people.  Please Elon stop that removal. You are already my hero but with that you'd be my everything. Musk 4 ever.  @Impossibilium Elon Musk was doing good when he bought it in the beginning, and especially when firing a lot of the workers that did practically nothing but now it's just... what the hell is happening? Regardless though I'm happy regrdless since Twitter will probably die, something that's been needed for a long time.  His name needs a M at the beginning.  @Blaze215 I just think he's annoying.  Musk needs to keep his filthy hands off PlayStation.  ""[source x.com]""Keep calm. Source of this article is alien hunting agency...  Musk is such a twerp. He should probably concern himself with not posting white supremacist tropes and theories and being a halfway functional human.  Removed - flaming/arguing  All that money, that power goes right to his head.  Removed - flaming/arguing  @Nepp67 That's why it's a mess there and he gets fined for letting fake news run rampant on his new little toy.  @thedevilsjester Given how many staff members Musk has sacked from twitter, may be sony did and no one picked up the phone.  I support X and Elon  I'm pretty sure there is a good reason for it or someone is getting fired.  @Blaze215 Oh please. The same man-child that silences other people? He's only against censorship when it's convenient for him lol. Much like the rest of them, he is a big ole hypocrite lol. Sony needs to leave Musk on read and don't return his phonecalls or DM's lol.  Removed - trolling  Far too much free speech on there Blackrock wouldn't like Sony doing that.  I'll call it Twitter until the day I die, honestly. And how can he stop them, exactly? Who was actually using that feature anyway? Who's still using Twitter?

 ‘Have I shot myself in the foot with tweets multiple times? Yes,’ Twitter owner says. Billionaire-entrepreneur Elon Musk acknowledged he has made mistakes on social media, in an at-times bizarre interview with the BBC overnight. ""Have I shot myself in the foot with tweets multiple times? Yes,” Musk said. “I think I should not tweet after 3 a.m.” Revealing the scale of the job cuts at Twitter since Musk bought the company for $44 billion last October, Musk said around 1,500 people currently work for the social media platform, down from “just under 8,000,"" after a series of what he described as ""painful"" layoffs. Musk defended the job cuts, claiming they were necessary to stave off bankruptcy. ""This is not a caring, uncaring situation. It's like if the whole ship sinks then nobody's got a job,"" Musk said, claiming that he had been ""under constant attack"" since buying Twitter.  The ""pain level has been extremely high"" since buying Twitter, Musk said. ""Were there many mistakes made a long the way? Of course. But all's well that ends well, I feel like we're headed to a good place."" The billionaire defended Twitter's move to phase out its previous system of verifying notable accounts and personalities with a blue tick, and introduce a system where any user can pay for the tick instead. Several news organizations, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, have said they would not pay to keep their blue ticks. ""It's a small amount of money, so I don't know what their problem is,"" Musk said. ""We're going to treat everyone equally."" He said legacy blue ticks would disappear next week. Asked whether he would sell Twitter for the same amount he paid for it, Musk said he wouldn't — unless the buyer was as committed to telling the truth as he claimed to be. Last month, Musk said he thought the company was now worth $20 billion. The live interview took place in Twitter's San Francisco headquarters, and the BBC was given ""about 20 minutes' notice"" that it would be going ahead, according to the British public broadcaster. Asked why he had agreed to sit down with the BBC, Musk said: ""Spontaneity."" Addressing a row over the decision by Twitter to label the BBC's Twitter accounted as ""government-funded media,"" Musk said the tag would be updated. “I actually do have a lot of respect for the BBC,” Musk said. “We want it as truthful and accurate as possible — we’re adjusting the label to ‘publicly funded.'"" The interview took some strange turns, with Musk at one point saying he was ""no longer the CEO of Twitter"" and repeating his claim that his dog had replaced him in the top job.  The interview went for longer than expected, with James Clayton, the BBC journalist interviewing Musk, attempting to end the discussion on several occasions, but the entrepreneur insisting on answering questions from users on Twitter Spaces.

Elon Musk took over Twitter – which he has since renamed X – and ...",https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/hype-no-innovation-experts-verdict-elon-musks-grok-chatgpt-rival-2735394?ico=related_article_inline,"A year ago, two major moments shook the world of technology. Elon Musk took over Twitter – which he has since renamed X – and OpenAI released ChatGPT, an AI chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM). The twin fates of both technologies have been a study of contrasting fortunes in the 12 months since. Musk has rebranded X in his own image, to significant controversy, while ChatGPT has taken over the world, sparking the generative AI revolution. But now they’re combining, with Musk unveiling his own ChatGPT competitor, powered by data taken from X. Called Grok, and developed by xAI, the AI-focused firm Musk founded in July, the AI chatbot acts similarly to ChatGPT. You ask it questions, and it gives you answers. However, Grok “is designed to have a little humour in its responses,” Musk tweeted. He promoted the chatbot on his social media platform with a screenshot of Grok answering a question about the trial of convicted crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, designed to highlight the chatbot’s ability to provide responses based on real-time information. Grok, which is still being developed, uses data from X’s hundreds of millions of users to help shape the tone and content of its responses. In February 2023, Musk drastically curtailed the ability for third-party firms to access Twitter data over fears that chatbots like ChatGPT were being trained on posts made on the platform. “Having a live Twitter data feed is perhaps the one novel aspect, but with the way Twitter has been going since Musk took over, I’m not sure how useful or pleasant that will be,” said Noah Giansiracusa, a professor at Bentley University in the United States studying AI.  Lynette Nusbacher, a strategist and former adviser to the UK government, added: “Musk has chosen to use a corpus [of training data] that is already perverted.” Musk claims Grok, which will only be available to paying subscribers to X’s Premium+ product, is already better at completing a suite of benchmark tasks than the original version of ChatGPT, and is gaining ground on the current version of OpenAI’s chatbot. However, AI experts question the need for another chatbot with comparable skills to those that already exist. ChatGPT can query real-time information through search queries on Bing, the search engine built by Microsoft, which has invested in OpenAI. “I don’t see what the big deal is,” said Giansiracusa. He points out that Grok isn’t more powerful than other chatbots already on the market. He added: “It has a different ‘personality’, but that’s easy to accomplish in other chatbots with prompting or fine-tuning. It seems like a lot of hype and marketing over something with little to no real innovation.” Others were also circumspect about Grok’s usefulness. “I can’t think of anything else than an AI chatbot with Elon Musk’s worldview,” said one former Twitter employee who was laid off by the Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder shortly after he took over the app in October 2022, and asked not to be named. The reasons Musk has launched the chatbot appear to be numerous. For one, he has a personal enmity with OpenAI, which he helped fund between 2015 and 2018, believing they have forsworn their initial pledge to develop AI not-for-profit. Since the rise of ChatGPT, Musk has made it his business to criticise their development as much as possible, warning of the risks of the company succeeding. Musk has also criticised, without evidence, existing chatbots’ perceived liberal biases, calling them “woke”. Grok is designed to be a counterweight to that, though its speed of development, and its general world view, has some worried. “One concern is that Grok is the product of two months of development,” said Carissa Veliz, associate professor at the University of Oxford’s Institute for Ethics in AI.  “Musk is famous for wanting to do things fast, and without much concern for safety,” she said. “Will this LLM be thoroughly tested for safety before it gets released to the wider public? And what can we expect, when the creator is someone who has criticised OpenAI’s efforts to prevent ChatGPT from parroting racism and sexism?” Musk has also been criticised for going back on his stated public position just months earlier when he signed a letter calling for a six-month pause in the development of AI tools smarter than the original version of ChatGPT. He tweeted that he signed the letter “knowing it was futile”, and that he simply wanted to publicly record his demand that development should be paused. Musk did not respond to i‘s request for comment. As to whether Grok will succeed, Giansiracusa isn’t sure. He said: “It’ll likely appeal to Musk’s rabid fanbase.” Beyond that, he’s less certain.

Now, Elon Musk is investigating the cause behind it. 

                    Sam Comrie                
 
Published: Nov 8, 2023  Xbox surprised legions of players earlier this year when it left behind X’s social media integration features. The social media platform, formerly known as Twitter, is home to players sharing moments from their favorite Xbox games, whether that is via screenshots or short clips. Now, X Corp. founder Elon Musk is eager to find out why Microsoft’s gaming arm has taken away sharing functionality on Xbox consoles.

 Reporting on the news of Sony preparing to shut down X-focused features on PS4 and PS5, X account ‘X News Daily’ speculates that the platform is “aiming to become a major streaming platform, but this will be less convenient for console players now that both Xbox and PlayStation integration is gone.”


 Taking note of this, Musk himself briefly responds, explaining that “I will look into this.” As a fan of some of the best Xbox games around, like Diablo 4, it wouldn’t be a surprising move to see the platform aim to replicate the success of Twitch or Kick. Musk has streamed the Blizzard Entertainment RPG on X in the past, posting in October that he had “tested the X video game streamer system” while showing off his Diablo 4 class in one of the best RPG games of the year.


 The option to stream games to X is believed to be part of Musk’s plans to make X an “everything app”, which includes dedicated Xbox and PS5 streaming tools in the future.


 Tested the 𝕏 video game streamer system last night. It works!


 Will try to complete a Tier 100 Nightmare dungeon tonight live on this platform.

 In the same stream as his Diablo 4 play through, Musk also clarifies that “we will add in streaming for Xbox and PS5. You know, we’re not trying to do everything better than every other app, but we want to say that if you want to do something within the X system or the X platform, you can do it if you want.”


 Alarm bells could be ringing for Musk, though, as Xbox’s disengagement with sharing features also shares commonality with Sony, as PS5 X integration is also soon to be off the cards for PlayStation console owners. A notice for PS5 players recently warns owners that X sharing features will cease to work from November 13, while Xbox brought its sharing partnership with X down in April this year. With X raising the cost of API access, the tool used to merge the two platforms together, this could be a vital factor in Microsoft and Sony’s decision to leave X integration behind.


 According to a report from The New York Times, X’s worth equates to around $19 billion, a steep drop from the $44 billion Musk paid last year.


 
 
 You can still share moments from all the new Xbox games you’re currently playing via the Xbox mobile application, which obtains screenshots and videos uploaded to Microsoft’s digital storage after linking with your console. The application is also handy for checking out the best Xbox Game Pass games, too.

85,Elon Musk's X only worth less than HALF of the $44Billion he paid for platform a year ago,The Mirror,2023-10-31,The 52-year-old entrepreneur bought Twitter last October after a protracted buyout and by the following summer shocked it users by suddenly changing its name to X ...,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/elon-musks-x-only-worth-31319726,"The 52-year-old entrepreneur bought Twitter last October after a protracted buyout and by the following summer shocked it users by suddenly changing its name to X  The social media platform X, formerly know as Twitter, that Elon Musk bought only a year ago has heavily crashed in its valuation.  Based on the company’s employee equity compensation plan, it is now reportedly valued at $19 billion - less than half of the $44billion he bought it for in October, 2022. The privately-held company is giving employees RSUs at a share price of $45, according to a couple of sources close to the matter. The company had offered employees stock in March at a $20billion valuation. Staff are believed to have received an email on Monday in relation to the equity grant agreements in screenshots reportedly seen by Fortune. READ MORE: Elon Musk's surprising love life - Amber Heard, on-off singer and 11 kids with unusual names The company has faced huge hurdles since Musk took over the reigns. According to internal documents, these challenges include an 80% employee turnover rate and billions in debt accumulated from the acquisition, reports Investing.com. In addition, changes in verification and content-moderation rules have cut almost 60% in US advertising revenue. In response to its decline, X has attempted to compensate its employees. This includes distributing new stock grants in the form of restricted stock units priced at $45 per share as well as pledging cash payments of $54.20 each for outstanding shares from the previous management. However, despite the many challenges his company is facing, Musk has remained positive about X's future. On the first anniversary of his buyout, he outlined his vision for X as an all-purpose app offering multifaceted services, marking a significant transformation from ""Twitter 1.0."" This vision is also supported by X's CEO Linda Yaccarino, who encouraged employees to simply ignore critics during a company meeting. Musk had initially agreed to buy Twitter for $44 billion last April.  This buyout hit a wall, though, due to a significant downturn in the stock market that hit tech companies hard, including his own Tesla company. By July 2022, Twitter’s stock price had fallen from the $54.20 a share that Musk had agreed to pay to around $34 a share. Earlier this month it was reported that Musk was considering pulling the app from its users in Europe in response to new EU regulations. It was suggested that the billionaire would block access in the EU region over disinformation compliance issues with the international body's Digital Services Act. However, Musk has since denied the reports and said in a tweet that he has no intention of pulling out of the EU. He called out the Insider report, which was based on alleged insider sources who claimed to have heard him talking about the possibility of blocking X in Europe, as ""utterly false"" and labelled the site as ""not a real publication."""
86,Elon Musk now values X/Twitter at $19billion after buying site for $44billion,NME,2023-11-01,Elon Musk has confirmed X/Twitter is now worth $19billion – less than half of the $44billion he paid to acquire it.,https://www.nme.com/news/elon-musk-now-values-x-twitter-at-19billion-after-buying-site-for-44billion-3526798,"The new valuation is $1billion less than what he thought it was worth earlier this year Elon Musk has confirmed that the social media platform formerly known as Twitter is now worth $19billion – less than half of the $44billion he paid to acquire it. The billionaire and Tesla founder acquired the platform in April last year, where he spent $44billion in the purchase, and proceeded to enlist a complete overhaul of many of the features. Now, under two years since he took over the site – which he has since rebranded as X – it has been confirmed that the brand is now worth less than half of what he initially paid for it. The report was shared yesterday (October 30) in a new update from Fortune. In the article, it was revealed that Musk awarded all of the employees who weren’t fired in the takeover equity in the company. This, he said, was valued at $19billion – the equivalent of $45 a share. That is a 55 per cent drop in value from when he bought Twitter back in April 2022, however, according to some the report still has the chance of being an overly optimistic estimate. This comes as Rolling Stone reported that the mutual fund company Fidelity – which contributed over $300 million to Musk’s Twitter takeover – thinks the figures may be incorrect, and estimates that the company is now worth 65 per cent less than last year. on Musk account on Twitter X is displayed on a smartphone on October 16, 2023. CREDIT: Nathan Stirk/Getty Images Similarly, even if the $19billion valuation is accurate, the figure is still $1billion less than what Musk claimed he thought X/Twitter was worth back in March – when an internal email showed that he valued it at $20billion. Following his takeover of the company, Musk has made countless headlines for the changes he has implemented. These include the removal of legacy verified blue ticks and plans to put X (formerly Twitter) behind a paywall in order to deter bots. Earlier this month, he also stopped the site from displaying news story headlines, and later announced plans to hide the number of replies, retweets and likes on posts. Elsewhere, the platform was sued under its X Corp title by a Florida-based legal marketing company that claims the platform’s rebrand infringes its trademark.

An Elon Musk biopic is being developed at A24 with Darren Aronofsky attached to direct, as first reported by Puck News and confirmed by multiple outlets. The film will be based on author Walter Isaacson’s authorized biography Elon Musk. Isaacson’s book Steve Jobs also served as the basis of Danny Boyle’s Oscar-nominated 2015 film of the same name, starring Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet. Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 and shrewdly invested in Tesla a few years later before becoming CEO of the electric automaker. More recently, he purchased Twitter for $44 Billion after trying to back out of the acquisition and made massive changes to the social media platform, including charging $8 per month for a blue checkmark and renaming it to X. During Musk’s tenure as the owner of Twitter, numerous celebrities have vocally criticized him and quit the platform, including Trent Reznor, Jack White, and Elton John. Meanwhile, he was recently sued by ex-partner Grimes over custody rights to their youngest child. For Aronofsky, this will be his second consecutive film with A24 after last year’s The Whale starring Brendan Fraser. Given Aronofsky’s surrealist directing style and the subject, the Musk biopic should be a compelling watch.

Since buying Twitter for $44bn in October 2022, Musk has fired thousands of staffers, including those working in content moderation, trust and safety, and public policy. He’s opened up verification, once reserved for notable users, to anyone that pays an $8 subscription fee, making it impossible to tell who’s real and who’s not. He’s blown up messaging, restricting the platform’s ability to privately text nearly any user to only those who pay. He’s booted journalists he doesn’t like from the service, labeled NPR as “state-affiliated media”, throttled traffic to news sites, reinstated previously-banned white nationalists, resurrected Donald Trump’s account, unleashed threats and harassment on former staff members, killed the best bots, feuded with the Anti-Defamation League, deprecated headlines, toyed with putting the whole site behind a paywall, installed a CEO who will forever be known for a disastrous first public interview, and destroyed one of the world’s most recognizable brand names – Twitter – by changing it to X. The result, one year later, is a platform in the throes of enshittification. X now resembles a creature from The Walking Dead – rotting, dangerous and a shadow of its former self. Under Musk’s reign, its usage is reportedly shrinking. Advertisers are pulling back; users are signing off or decamping to rivals; and the town square that was once the world’s collective pulse, is now on fire. “The word I am looking for is ‘trashy’,” said a former Twitter reliability engineer who requested to remain anonymous for fear of Musk’s famed litigiousness. “Musk’s Twitter is trashy. My feed is filled with trash. The ads between those tweets are also trash.” The ongoing war between Hamas and Israel is the latest geopolitical crisis to expose X’s putrid guts. Hours after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, X was awash in misinformation. Accounts with thousands of followers passed off footage from military video games as scenes from the conflict. Screenshots of fake White House statements promising billions of dollars in aid to Israel went viral. Far-right influencers juiced X’s algorithms by pumping out endless streams of dangerous falsehoods for profit and engagement. Musk amplified it by recommending people follow two known antisemitic accounts to keep up with the latest Israel-Palestine news. Devoid of moderation teams, X’s official safety account suggested that people rely on crowdsourced Community Notes to figure out truth from lies (it didn’t work). Nearly two weeks after Hamas attacked, X suddenly removed The New York Times’ verification page for a few hours and then restored it with no explanation. “The only reason I am still on Twitter is because I want to see what’s going to happen to it,” the reliability engineer said. A recent analysis by NewsGuard showed that X’s verified users, who had paid for their blue checks, were responsible for 74% of Israel and Hamas war-related falsehoods that went viral on the platform. Before she was one of the thousands of employees Musk laid off from Twitter at the end of last year, Melissa Ingle worked on a team responsible for civic integrity and tackling the spread of political misinformation on the platform. She also wrote algorithms to moderate harmful content. Ingle, who is now a senior data scientist at an IT company, said she couldn’t believe how bad these problems are now. “The things that we were protecting against then are exactly the things that we’re seeing all over the site right now,” she said. “When it comes to political misinformation, you have to be on top of that stuff at all times, or it just spreads everywhere.” Twitter once played a crucial role in the Arab Spring and in amplifying the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements. In countries like India where freedom of expression has increasingly come under threat from a Hindu nationalist government, the social network formerly known as Twitter served as a much-needed space for dissent, birthing a new class of influencers who questioned the country’s government when mainstream media did not. But now, X runs on the whims of a billionaire and is among the worst places on the internet to keep up with news or make an impact. Instead of showing you posts from people you follow, the platform now defaults to a “For You” mode filled with grifters, recycled memes, idiots, AI hustlers, cat videos, car accidents and far-right influencers. Sensible, informative posts appear to get virtually no engagement – links are explicitly deprioritized, stifling the news while viral garbage floats to the top, thanks to an algorithmic tweak that Musk says optimizes for time spent on the platform above anything else. Like most journalists around the world, I used Twitter perhaps a bit too much. For years, it was one of the best places to find new voices, network and make new sources. And even though it didn’t drive a significant amount of traffic to stories, no other platform got you the digital clout that Twitter did. Of course, it wasn’t without its problems. It struggled with hate speech and harassment issues and moved too slowly to fix them. In emerging markets in particular, these problems were even worse. Like other major social media platforms, Twitter was slow to invest in local language moderation outside of the US. And its senior leadership was shockingly ignorant of cultural dynamics that fuelled hate speech outside the US. But there were still moments when it shone, like when it boxed with with nationalist governments to protect its users’ freedom of speech. In March 2021, a deadly second wave of Covid-19 rolled across my home, India, weeks after the BJP government declared that it had defeated the pandemic. Some estimates say nearly 5 million people died. New Delhi, India’s capital, broke down almost entirely – makeshift pyres burned alongside the river as cremation grounds ran out of space and hospital chains ran out of oxygen supplies. Bodies, bloated beyond recognition, floated serenely down the Ganges. The government tried its best to hide the human cost of that wave. But anyone scrolling through Twitter could see the nightmare unfolding in real time. Our timelines filled with pictures and videos from sources we could trust and pleas for oxygen, medicines and supplies from people, hospitals and even embassies amplified by thousands of retweets as people scrambled to keep each other alive. It was horrible, but it was all true. Now, I can’t trust much of anything that crosses my timeline. The community of journalists I was a part of has evaporated and decamped for smaller alternatives that have yet to live up to their potential. I have spent this year mourning the loss of that special space we had, despite the endless problems like hate speech and harassment that we also complained about constantly. A former employee once called Twitter a “honeypot for assholes”, a reputation that the company tried to fix for years before the world’s richest man snapped it up. Now, after a year of being owned by Elon Musk, only the assholes reign supreme."
90,Elon Musk issues strong statement on the cost of EV battery materials: ‘As we look ahead a few years,Yahoo Movies UK,2023-11-03,"According to Bloomberg, an easing of supply pressures has seen the cost of lithium carbonate halved, while nickel and cobalt ...",https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/elon-musk-issues-strong-statement-050000222.html,"The declining price of lithium will make a huge difference in the affordability of making and buying electric vehicles, and Elon Musk is particularly happy about it. According to Bloomberg, an easing of supply pressures has seen the cost of lithium carbonate halved, while nickel and cobalt — other important materials used in the production of EV batteries — have also seen a drop in prices. On a Tesla earnings call, company CEO Musk noted, per Bloomberg, that “lithium prices went absolutely insane there for a while,” but he added that “deflationary pressures” seemed to be prevailing. The price reductions will make production costs more affordable, making price cuts more feasible for EV producers — and prices better for customers. Tesla has already slashed the prices of its more expensive models in a bid to boost demand. The international journal Nature published details of how lithium-ion batteries are “smaller and lighter” than nickel-cadmium batteries but still provide the same power. They also “retain their charge for longer and are composed of much less toxic materials.” The possibility of better lithium batteries is seen as one of the most crucial factors in the move away from dirty energy. While the generation of power via solar and wind is well-known and increasingly common, storing that energy is a bigger problem. In cars especially, power storage is a vital factor in purchasing decisions. The ability to travel greater distances on a single charge is a huge pull factor, but having heavy batteries can be detrimental to an EV’s performance. Lighter lithium batteries, therefore, are favored. Tesla is constructing a lithium refinery in Texas, which is set to be completed in 2024, according to the Austin American-Statesman. According to Reuters, Musk said at the groundbreaking ceremony that the facility would produce enough lithium to help build around one million EVs by 2025. “As we look ahead a few years, a fundamental choke point in the advancement of electric vehicles is the availability of battery grade lithium,” Musk added.

       Elon Musk is trying to stop users from posting viral misinformation on Twitter/X by clamping down on its revenue-sharing program. For months now, Twitter/X has been rewarding users for viral tweets with real cash — even if those tweets contained misleading claims or blatantly wrong information. But on Sunday, Musk said his company would try to end the practice.   To do so, Twitter/X will lean on Community Notes, a crowdsourcing way to fact-check tweets. “Any posts that are corrected by @CommunityNotes become ineligible for revenue share,” Musk said. “The idea is to maximize the incentive for accuracy over sensationalism.” The company’s revenue-sharing program, which debuted in July, has been spotted sending five-figure payouts to top influencers, which may have prompted others to post attention-grabbing tweets in order to make money. Last week, X CEO Linda Yaccarino said the company has already paid over $20 million to creators.  But the same system has come under criticism for giving users financial incentive to post misleading, divisive, or factually wrong tweets. A recent study found that much of the misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war on Twitter/X came from verified accounts, which are eligible for the revenue-sharing program. It looks like Musk agrees there’s a problem. But the big question is whether Twitter’s Community Notes feature will be able to rein in the misinformation. Community Notes is volunteer driven and has faced its own fair share of criticism over how it can be exploited to spread misinformation or suffer from in-fighting over which fact-checks should be elevated to the top.   In response, Twitter/X says it recently improved the company's algorithms to make Community Notes “more sensitive to potentially inaccurate notes.” The company’s CEO added: “Community Notes now has over 100K contributors in 44 countries and growing. This product is not perfect, but it is improving rapidly. Notes are being seen tens of millions of times per day, and they are getting much faster.” Musk added that ""any attempts to weaponize Community Notes to demonetize people will be immediately obvious, because all code and data is open source.""

       Elon Musk’s newest startup, xAI, debuted just a few months ago, but the company is already close to shipping its first system, Musk says. ""Tomorrow, xAI will release its first AI to a select group. In some important respects, it is the best that currently exists,"" Musk tweeted today. He didn't say much else, including the scope of the AI system. But he’s repeatedly talked about developing a competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which he claims possesses a bias toward “political correctness.” (Musk helped found OpenAI but cut ties in 2018 and has been publicly critical of the company ever since.) “So yeah, I’m going to start something called TruthGPT. Or a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe,” Musk told former Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson in April. To create the chatbot, Musk hired about a dozen engineers and researchers from Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI to help him run the San Francisco-based xAI.  Musk also said the startup will harvest data on Twitter/X—another company he already owns— to train the startup’s AI programs. “We will use the public tweets —obviously not anything private— for training as well just like everyone else has,” he said in July.   By using the public tweets as training data, the startup might be able to teach its AI programs to respond with the most up-to-date human language and knowledge. But the plan has encountered resistance and boycotts from some users, who say they never gave Twitter/X explicit permission to use their tweets to train AI programs.  In the meantime, Musk has been warning of AI's potential effects on society in talks this week with podcaster Joe Rogan and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. “How could AI go wrong?” he told Rogan. “If AI gets programmed by the extinctionists—its utility function will be the extinction of humanity.” I've been with PCMag since October 2017, covering a wide range of topics, including consumer electronics, cybersecurity, social media, networking, and gaming.

94,Stephen King trolls Elon Musk over his new AI chatbot,NME,2023-11-09,"Stephen King has taken to X/Twitter to share his opinion on the announcement of Elon Musk's new AI chatbot, named Grok.",https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/film/stephen-king-elon-musk-twitter-3533424,"“This X shit’s got to go”, King previously tweeted Stephen King has seemingly mocked Elon Musk on X/Twitter over the app’s new AI chatbot. The renowned horror author, known for writing the novels behind the blockbuster movies It, The Shining and Carrie, took to the app to share his feelings about its recent name change. Last week, King, 76, posted a tweet saying, “This X shit’s got to go” referring to the controversial rebranding of the 17-year-old social media app. But on Sunday, Musk tweeted announcing his newest AI chatbot, Grok, and King responded to the tweet in a way that could be described as trolling. Big whoop. https://t.co/uaULSjT8Or — Stephen King (@StephenKing) November 5, 2023  King quoted Musk’s “Just released Grok” tweet with a simple, “Big whoop.” This seemed to amuse Musk who responded with two laughing emoji symbols and an offer, “Wanna try it?”, to which King hasn’t yet responded. 😂😂 Wanna try it? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 6, 2023  It’s not the first time King has expressed his opinion on some of the app’s changes, or started a conversation with X’s new owner and founder of SpaceX. Back in October, King complained about the new fee to keep the blue tick to show verification. It’s just one of the many radical changes Musk has made to the app, and something which many users found issue with. $20 a month to keep my blue check? Fuck that, they should pay me. If that gets instituted, I’m gone like Enron. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) October 31, 2022  King tweeted, “$20 a month to keep my blue check? Fuck that, they should pay me. If that gets instituted, I’m gone like Enron.” Musk replied to the tweet, negotiating a lower price with the Misery author: “We need to pay the bills somehow! Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers. How about $8?” I will explain the rationale in longer form before this is implemented. It is the only way to defeat the bots & trolls. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 1, 2022  Musk continued his explanations in a further tweet: “I will explain the rationale in longer form before this is implemented. It is the only way to defeat the bots & trolls.” Elsewhere, King faced divided opinion on Twitter last month when he promoted one of J.K. Rowling’s books.

X has been trying to obtain licenses in every US state to offer banking and money transfer services. Musk's wants X to be like the WeChat super app in China. Elon Musk expects X to roll out financial features by the end of next year, The Verge reported on Friday. Musk, the owner, chairman, and CTO of X — the platform formerly known as Twitter — gave his projection of the financial ambitions in an all-hands call on Thursday. The Verge obtained an audio recording of the meeting. During the all-hands call, Musk said he wants ""someone's entire financial life"" on the platform so people wouldn't need a bank account. ""If it involves money. It'll be on our platform — money or securities or whatever,"" he said. Musk is so confident about the platform's financial ambitions that he said it would blow his mind if the company doesn't roll out the features by the deadline, per The Verge. Musk's projected timeline for X to roll out financial services comes a year after Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion. The billionaire — who is the world's richest person with an estimated $200 billion fortune per Bloomberg — rebranded the platform to X earlier this year.

In June last year, Musk outlined his ambitions for Twitter to become a super app like WeChat of China — where users not just use it as a social media platform but also for payments and other services. WeChat also offers functions such as video games and meeting new friends. Musk said on the same Thursday call that X would also be a ""fully fledged"" dating site next year, Insider reported.

So, the sight of Elon Musk charging towards Wikipedia with his trademark guile and ...",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/23/why-is-elon-musk-attacking-wikipedia-because-its-very-existence-offends-him,"The X owner has no time for a democratic experiment dedicated to knowledge. He would rather yell puerile ‘jokes’ into the ether Just before the 2017 UK general election, I was introduced to the distinction between the good internet and the bad internet, democratically speaking. First, I had to learn what “civic tech” meant. In the broadest possible terms, it’s using online platforms to do socially useful things, rather than sell things, buy things or whip each other into an unspeakable fury about stuff that we didn’t care about five minutes ago. The civic tech expert Ed Saperia used as his parable the difference between Wikipedia and Facebook. Jimmy Wales’s big experiment, which started life in 1999 as Nupedia, has created an open-source collection of human knowledge in hundreds of languages that is essentially trustworthy. If a mistake creeps in through the gates of human generosity, it gets corrected in the same way. If malicious actors try to slander their foes, the punishment is not cancellation, but more like lifelong ridicule, which is proportionate, given how long a slanderous person is likely to carry on doing ridiculous things. In other words, it is the best of humanity, all natural desire to help each other with cross-pollinated knowledge concentrated in one place. Facebook, for brevity, takes the same raw material – all the people in the world – and finds the worst in it. Facebook manages to winkle out things we didn’t know we were capable of – levels of vitriol, gullibility and hysteria – in between a scare ad for dark politics and a mesmerising video of five types of mince baked around a kilo of cheese. (I am paraphrasing a bit; I don’t think civic tech gurus dwell much on the cheese.) If you could work out how these two projects became so different, you would probably have a blueprint for the next phase of the internet. Regulation sounds fanciful and boring, but socialisation? That would work: corralling the wild west into a functioning global community. I figured that the best contribution I could make was to stop ignoring that “please give us two quid” banner at the top of Wikipedia. All this was after the phrase “fake news” had been invented and repurposed by Donald Trump to toxify information everywhere. While the right minds are tackling this problem, a lot of the wrong minds have been doing so as well. As the Nobel Peace prize winner Maria Ressa has warned, online misinformation could end democracy as we know it. So, the sight of Elon Musk charging towards Wikipedia with his trademark guile and delicacy was so predictable that it was almost relaxing. He saw a collective resource that people prized and he wanted to hurt it. Why does Wales even need any money to run Wikipedia in the first place, he wondered on Sunday. You could fit the entire thing on your phone, he claimed. Eleven minutes later, he offered $1bn if it would change its name to Dickipedia. After Musk’s adventures on X, formerly Twitter, his views on what things cost and the relevance of what you can fit on your phone mostly evoke the thought: “Wow, to think I once took as read that tech bro billionaires knew what they were talking about!” The rest just make you wince. We called Twitter a sink even before Musk bought it, but that misses one fact: there were people making dick jokes that were funny about a thousand times an hour. Of the many points Musk missed when he bought Twitter, one concerned the standard of content he was seeking to govern. It’s like watching a drunk frat boy bowl up and flash Dorothy Parker. Wincing and scorn aside, Musk is after Wikipedia for a reason. The sight of something created socially that works is an insult to him. I would spend two quid a month, or more, just for that.

The billionaire - who has accused the website of showing its 'non-trivial left-wing bias' in the past - was responding to Wikipedia's donation appeal for the year. 'I will give them a billion dollars if they change their name to D–kipedia,' Musk posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday. He then jokingly asked to add that to his Wikipedia page, which he said includes the cow and poop emojis after he criticized the Wikipedia Foundation. 'Have you ever wondered why the Wikimedia Foundation wants so much money? It certainly isn't needed to operate Wikipedia,' he said. 'You can literally fit a copy of the entire text on your phone! The world's richest man, Elon Musk, has offered $1billion of that cold hard cash to the owners of Wikipedia, with the aim of crudely changing it's name to 'D***ipedia,' he wrote Sunday 'I will give them a billion dollars if they change their name to D–kipedia,' Musk posted on X, formerly Twitter, which is owned by the Tesla CEO 'So, what's the money for? Inquiring minds want to know...' Musk received a 'community note' - a fact-checking mechanism he has implemented since buying the site - correcting him and noting that in 2022 Wikimedia had $154million in revenue but $145million in expenses. 'The Wikimedia Foundation is a charitable non-profit, providing free access to Wikipedia,' the note claimed. 'While a text & English-only copy of Wikipedia is about 51GB, adding all media + supported languages brings it to 428TB.' In 2022 Wikimedia had $154million in revenue with $145million in expenses. He joked with journalist and Musk acolyte Brian Krassenstein that the offer was only for 'one year minimum. I mean, I'm a not fool lol.' In December of 2022, the billionaire CEO accused the website of showing its 'non-trivial left-wing bias' by debating deleting an article about the newly released Twitter files, which show how staff suppressed tweets and stories about Hunter Biden's laptop. The Wikipedia entry for the investigation now has a note saying it is being 'considered for deletion in accordance with Wikipedia's deletion policy'. On its deletion discussion page, editors brand the Twitter files a 'nothing burger' and 'not notable'. The billionaire - who has accused the website of showing its 'non-trivial left-wing bias' in the past - was responding to Wikipedia's donation appeal for the year He then jokingly asked to add that to his Wikipedia page, which also as he points out, includes the cow and poop emojis after he criticized the Wikipedia Foundation for its largesse He also joked with journalist and Musk acolyte Brian Krassenstein that the offer was only for 'one year minimum. I mean, I'm a not fool lol' Musk seized on the debate, saying it shows how Wikipedia, like the mainstream media, has a left-wing bias that is acting against his agenda. He wrote on Twitter: 'Most of Earth: 'The MSM is biased.' Wikipedia: 'Cite MSM source to confirm this claim.' 'Wikipedia has a non-trivial left-wing bias.' The row came after Musk fired his general counsel James A. Baker, citing his alleged involvement in suppressing the release of internal documents about the Hunter Biden scandal. 'In light of concerns about Baker's possible role in suppression of information important to the public dialogue, he was exited from Twitter today,' Musk wrote in a tweet on Tuesday. Musk added that Baker's explanation of the events surrounding the laptop saga was 'unconvincing.'

100,Elon Musk says X to have two new premium tiers,BBC,2023-10-20,"Elon Musk has said his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, will launch two new tiers of premium subscriptions ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67167804,"Elon Musk has said his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, will launch two new tiers of premium subscriptions. ""One is lower cost with all features, but no reduction in ads, and the other is more expensive, but has no ads,"" the billionaire said in a post on X. It comes as the firm started charging new users $1 in New Zealand and the Philippines for accessing the platform. Mr Musk did not provide more details on the plans. New users who opt out of subscribing will only be able to take ""read only"" actions, such as reading posts, watching videos, and following accounts, the company said in its website. It is not clear if there will be any free options. Mr Musk has long said that his solution for getting rid of bots and fake accounts on the social media platform is charging for the service.  Since taking over the firm in October last year he has looked to incentivise users to pay for an enhanced service, which is now called X Premium. Some users now opt to pay $8 per month for the blue check subscription service. Its ""Not A Bot"" subscription method aims to reduce spam, manipulation of the platform and bot activity. He has also tried to woo advertisers back to X with offers of discounts. Mr Musk's rapid changes, including mass layoffs and disbanding content moderation teams, has led to advertisers halting ads on the service. He acknowledged that the platform has taken a hit on revenue and blamed activists for pressuring advertisers. Other big tech companies have also experimented with a mix of ad-supported and subscription plans.  While Alphabet's YouTube has both paid and free, ad-supported ones, Netflix's ad-supported plans are also chargeable, though at a lower price. YouTube, which like X is populated by content from users, shares a part of its subscription revenue with creators. X, which also shares some of its ad revenue with content creators, did not disclose if content creators will be paid in ad-free subscription models. Despite Mr Musk's attempts to generate revenue on X, as the company faced criticism over lax content moderation, advertisers have not come flooding back over concerns their ads might appear next to inappropriate content. Last week, the European Commission launched an investigation into X to see whether it complies with new tech rules on illegal and harmful content following the spread of disinformation on its platform after Hamas's attack on Israel.

This particular individual specialises in incendiary incidents from all over the world and posts several times a day to just under a million followers.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/14/elon-musk-x-twitter-content-israel-disinformation-business-model,"The social network owner’s business model appears to include a slurry of unmoderated toxicity, such as footage of a murder At 4am a couple of weeks ago, Ryan Carson, a young activist for social justice, was sitting with his girlfriend at the B38 bus stop at Lafayette Avenue and Malcolm X Boulevard in New York. They were on their way home from a wedding party. Carson was suddenly accosted by an aggressive stranger who asked: “What the fuck are you looking at?” and then stabbed him to death. The murder was captured by a surveillance camera, the video from which somehow made its way to the New York Post and thence on to the internet, where it was seized upon on X, formerly known as Twitter, by one of the social network’s prolific “shitposters” (the ones X’s owner, Elon Musk, calls “creators”). This particular individual specialises in incendiary incidents from all over the world and posts several times a day to just under a million followers. Dave Lee, a Bloomberg columnist who lives in the same neighbourhood of New York as the victim, doesn’t follow this shitposter, but the platform’s algorithms made sure that he saw the video. The uploader had added an inflammatory comment on Carson’s work in public policy, “as though it had somehow led to this moment, as though he had it coming”, noted Lee. “As I rode the subway home to Bedford-Stuyvesant,” Lee wrote, “I watched as the video clocked 1m views, then 2m. Up up up. Disgusting replies flooded in by the thousands: That’s what you get for supporting woke policies; should have carried a gun; looks planned. By the time I got home, I had deleted the app from my phone.” Welcome to social media, Musk-style. When he first bought what was then Twitter, the image that came to mind was of a delicate clock being donated to a monkey. That has turned out to be an understatement. In his desperation to find a way of getting the platform to earn enough revenue to pay off the debt he incurred to buy it, Musk has become a pretty malignant monkey. Among other things, he sacked half the staff (including many of those who were responsible for moderating content), alienated advertisers, started charging for premium access – and in July instituted “creator payouts to select accounts”, many of which had followings in the hundreds of thousands (and included some of Musk’s favourite users). The guy who broadcast Carson’s murder might well be one of them. If so, God alone knows how much he would have earned just from that post. Musk, though, does. Twitter wasn’t that great long before he acquired it, but at least it had committed employees who tried hard to reduce the toxicity of its more malignant users. Under Musk, though, with his fatuous delusions about “freedom of speech”, just about anything goes. At the moment, for example, it seems to be riddled with disinformation about Hamas’s brutal invasion of Israel and QAnon-inspired fantasies about the “stolen” 2020 US presidential election, the role of the “deep state” in persecuting the January 6 insurgents, anti-vax conspiracy theories and so on. Many observers are puzzled by Musk’s apparent determination to destroy his expensive new toy. How could an ostensibly intelligent multibillionaire be so stupid, they ask? But maybe that’s the wrong question. What if Musk knows what he’s doing – that he sees a viable business in encouraging shitposting and mining the resultant ordure? That, at any rate, is the interesting hypothesis advanced in an entrancing essay by Johns Hopkins political scientist Henry Farrell, one of the sharpest dudes around. Its underlying metaphor is that of the mushroom, a fungus that thrives on being kept in the dark under a pile of manure. Farrell’s point is that “some people are quite happy to be kept in the dark, well fertilised with horseshit. And that is the foundation for a business model. Not a rapidly expanding one of the kind that could allow Twitter’s massive debt burden to ever be paid off. But it can keep on producing its cash crop, year in, year out.” It’s basically the business model that enabled the infamous conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to become a multimillionaire – at least until he came a cropper in the US courts. But for Musk to pull it off, he first has to ensure that all the users on the platform are mushrooms. After all, it’s much cheaper to run a social media company when you don’t have to employ moderators to keep it clean and legal. But for that to happen, he needs to drive off all the earnest idiots who labour under the pathetic delusion that being on X is somehow essential for the wellbeing or profitability of their organisations. Think, for example, of the endless list of public events, lectures, presentations, conferences and suchlike that open with the organiser, having explained the arrangements for evacuating the premises in case of fire, then brightly unveils the X hashtag under which they should tweet what are laughingly called their thoughts. Little do they know that, in doing this, they are doing their bit to frustrate Musk’s business strategy. Which perhaps may help to salve their consciences about using a platform even if it enables people to profit from the virality of senseless killing.

Many users of the social media platform are extremely frustrated with the sudden policy change, with some threatening to delete their accounts as a result.  X (formerly Twitter ) users will now have to pay a premium to avoid ads, Elon Musk has announced  Since taking over Twitter in 2022, Elon Musk has made a series of bold changes to the site's payment model with the stated aim of reducing the number of bots on the platform 'I'm just about done with Twitter tbh', wrote one frustrated X user in response to the announcement. Another echoed the sentiment of many users, writing: 'Yeeeahhhh I won't pay a dollar'.  And one vented: 'Musky is coming out with a two-tier subscription for Twitter and I am probably going to bail when that happens.' Other users complained that Musk appeared to be charging more money from the user base without providing any improvements to service. 'As if he [Musk] needs more moolah,' one user wrote.  Another added: 'The willingness to turn Twitter into Spirit Airlines is admirable', in reference to the budget airline often cited as including extra charges for seemingly basic services.  Musk, who took over the platform in October 2022, has been trying to boost revenue by charging users and by wooing back advertisers, who stopped buying ads after Musk fired most employees and disbanded content moderation teams.       Users of X (formerly Twitter) met the announcement with frustration as Elon Musk continues to suggest that X may become a fully paid platform  UK iOS Monthly Price - £11.00 iOS Yearly Price - £114.99 Web Monthly Price - £9.60 Web Yearly Price - £100.80  US iOS Monthly Price - $11.00 iOS Yearly Price - $114.99 Web Monthly Price - £8.00 Web Yearly Price - £84.00 Twitter Blue subscribers can write longer tweets, gain better visibility, and restrict replies to only other premium members However, Musk has not yet provided any details on how the supposed extra charges will be implemented or any timeline on when this might take place. This has left users speculating over the potential cost of the 'more expensive' service and how the change would impact those already paying for a premium Twitter Blue subscription.  This announcement comes as Twitter starts charging new users in New Zealand and the Philippines $1 (£0.82) to access basic services.  The 'Not a Bot' subscription plan required users to pay a yearly fee and verify their phone number to post, reply, retweet, or otherwise engage with other members on the site. Those who opted out of the paid subscription will still be able to create 'read-only' accounts capable of reading posts, watching videos, and following accounts. Elon Musk said that the change was aimed at reducing the number of bots on the platform - a key issue for Musk since his takeover and something that the company has struggled to control.  While estimates vary, researchers generally suggest that bots currently make up somewhere around 10 per cent of accounts on the site.  Cybra, a tech company which uses artificial intelligence to verify accounts, suggested that 11 per cent of all accounts on the site in 2022 were bots, Insider reported. During the launch of Not a Bot, X's official account tweeted that the change is 'not a profit driver' adding: 'So far, subscription options have proven to be the main solution that works at scale.'

Sky News looks back at the billionaire's first year in charge of one of the world's biggest online platforms. By  Tom Acres, technology reporter   Friday 27 October 2023 03:10, UK Start with the big idea and deal with any issues down the line. That was the assessment of Elon Musk biographer Michael Vlismas a year ago when asked how the world's richest man might go about running Twitter. The SpaceX owner had just bought the bird app for $44bn (£38bn) with a vague goal of transforming it into an ""everything app"" called X. Modelled on China's WeChat, it could become your one-stop shop for not just getting into arguments online and posting memes, but video calls, podcasts, and even banking. All while being an internet town square, committed to free speech, where anyone's views have as much cache as a celebrity, news outlet, or academic - no matter how controversial. A noble goal, many would argue. But as Vlismas had indicated, a plan light on detail. And the execution - from huge lay-offs to putting verification behind subscriptions - has been debatable at best. ""He always has a grand vision, but in this instance the details have been a quagmire for him,"" says Vlismas. ""Perhaps it's showing you can't be everything to everyone - and that's the challenge with an 'everything app'. ""It's got to be a clear vision in terms of what he wants out of it."" A tumultuous timeline Musk's own Twitter timeline was rarely dull, so perhaps it should come as no surprise that once he ruled the roost, Twitter's own timeline would follow suit. His first act (other than carrying a sink into the firm's San Francisco HQ for the sake of a bad pun) was firing executives and thousands of employees quickly suffered the same fate. Skittish advertisers, concerned about Musk's stance on content moderation, helped see revenues fall and within a month even the prospect of bankruptcy was being mooted. Musk's flagship attempt to drive up company income was to offer verification ticks as a paid-for benefit in a subscription that has expanded to include features like an edit button and longer posts. A fake Tony Blair, OJ Simpson, and very naughty Super Mario later, it was clear there were flaws in this plan to allow anyone to pay to add the once-respected blue tick to their account. According to analysis by research group AMPLYFI, which used AI to judge user sentiment on Twitter over time, the furore was ""the initial catalyst for things turning sour"" for much of the platform's audience. ""It created chaos,"" says Drew Benvie, founder of communications agency Battenhall. ""People don't know if they're talking to the real deal."" Ahead of a year that will include a US presidential election, and with ever-improving AI deepfakes, it's an issue that could become even more serious. Other changes have included reinstating banned accounts like those of Andrew Tate and Donald Trump, raising further concerns about the proliferation of hate speech on the platform. The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a group X has sued over its damning assessments of its content moderation standards, says Musk has welcomed back a host of bad actors ""with open arms"". Speaking to mark the Muskiversary, CCDH founder Imran Ahmed condemned it as a ""grave betrayal of users, advertisers and the wider public"". That, coupled with the gutting of the company's trust and safety teams, damaged Twitter's reputation as a place to seek out verified news - an issue brought home by the Israel-Hamas war. And then, of course, came rebranding Twitter into X. A name so embedded in modern society that ""tweet"" had entered the Oxford and Cambridge dictionaries, now one which would have once done nothing but arouse suspicion in your browsing history. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  'He has decimated the business' Musk said Twitter's transition from talking shop to everything app meant the name no longer made sense, and has claimed the rebranding reflects his ambitions. Of course, some may have spotted an obvious trend and concluded he simply likes the letter X. Not only is it part of the name of his successful rocket company, but one of his children; his AI start-up; and an internet banking firm he co-founded that became PayPal. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free Social media expert Beth Caroll, of Wunderman Thompson, is sceptical of Musk's apparent plans. ""There's a vague possibility he could have this bigger picture idea, this super app like a WeChat, and if he were to deliver that then he might have a viable product,"" she says. ""But for now he has just decimated the business."" Indeed, earlier this year the company was valued at less than a third of the $44bn Musk paid for it. Even the hiring of Linda Yaccarino, an experienced figure from NBCUniversal, as chief executive has done little to repair the monetary or reputational damage. It's worth remembering, Caroll says, that Musk did try awfully hard to back out of buying Twitter, and all the challenges he's faced are perhaps a sign of why. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Can Musk really have it all? Yet despite it all, for its remaining users - whether enthusiastic or reluctant - X remains best at this particular type of social media, where real-time updates reign supreme.  For Dr Annmarie Hanlon, lecturer in digital and social marketing at Cranfield School of Management, would-be rivals from the ""clunky"" Mastodon to Meta's ""basic"" Threads have failed to offer a comparable experience. ""The everything app is still a work in progress,"" she says. ""But when Threads opened, everyone said 'this is the death of Twitter'. And it hasn't been."" Of course, given the contempt Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have for each other, don't expect the Meta boss to abandon his company's new app anytime soon. And when it comes to ""the death of Twitter"", Musk would happily claim responsibility, with X the phoenix rising from its ashes. But unlike the rockets of SpaceX (well, most of them), biographer Vlismas doubts how far it can fly.  ""With SpaceX, the grand vision is colonising Mars,"" he says. ""But the core purpose is launching rockets into space and it's very effective at that. ""If you wanted to do anything else with it, it dilutes that purpose. ""The longer X is a bit muddled like this, the worse it is. And the more people will turn away.""

            Latest Market News 


 
      It’s been one year to the day since Elon Musk completed his purchase of Twitter for $44 billion and set the company, along with its employees and users, off on a whiplash-inducing series of twists and turns.
   
      Twelve months on, the company barely resembles its former self — and not only because Musk renamed it “X” and did away with its iconic blue bird branding. Through a dizzying and haphazard barrage of changes, Musk has transformed a profitable company once regarded as the world’s go-to source for breaking news and political commentary into a widely ridiculed platform that’s fighting just to break even and crippled by debt; that’s struggling to manage spam and disinformation; that’s alienated some of its biggest advertisers and users; and that’s casting about for purpose.
   
      Even as Musk — and new CEO Linda Yaccarino — push their vision for X as an “everything app,” the company has seemingly no clear path back to prominence or respectability, or to recouping Musk’s massive investment.
   
      Driving the transformation has been a relentless stream of layoffs, resignations and policy reversals, as well as messy product rollouts and unfulfilled promises. The company faces a series of legal challenges brought by everyone from former employees to company contractors and landlords that have further complicated its outlook. X is also the subject of multiple regulatory investigations by the US Federal Trade Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission and EU officials that could potentially lead to penalties, both for the company as well as Musk himself.
   
Musk’s X cashes in on ‘superspreaders’ of Israel-Hamas misinformation, new report finds
 
      X claims engagement is up, but the company appears to use different metrics than it did prior to the Musk takeover, making a true comparison difficult. Visits to the company’s website are down 14% compared to last September, far outstripping the 3.7% decline industrywide over the same period, according to a report this month by the internet monitoring firm Similarweb.
   
      Yaccarino said in a statement Thursday that she is “incredibly proud of the work our team has been doing to accelerate the future of X.” The X CEO highlighted some of the new products and features launched over the past year, including the ability for companies to post job listings, longer posts, and audio and video calls for Premium users, which rolled out this week. She said that X is “a place where everyone can freely express themselves, so long as they do so within the bounds of the law,” and added that safety remains a “critical priority” for the platform.
   
      “If we can achieve all of this in just 12 months, just imagine the scope of our ambition for next year,” Yaccarino said.
   
      X is now facing perhaps its biggest test yet under new ownership amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war — and numerous tech watchdogs and civil society groups have raised alarms about false claims and propaganda linked to the conflict on the platform. And as next year’s elections in the United States and elsewhere raise fears about the further spread of misinformation campaigns, X’s value to the public conversation appears increasingly in doubt.
   
      All of this unfolded over the course of just 365 days. But for many, likely including beleaguered users who have decamped for alternatives such as Threads, Mastodon and BlueSky, it’s felt more like a decade. Here’s a (non-exhaustive) account of how Musk has fundamentally changed Twitter since he made one of the most consequential acquisitions of the social media age.
   
      In a series of rolling layoffs in the months after his takeover, Musk axed what he would later describe as roughly 80% of the company’s headcount.
   
      Few departments were left untouched by the layoffs. They affected positions in some of the company’s most critical areas: policy, trust and safety, communications, ethical AI, search and more. The result was a hollowed-out workforce charged with maintaining rickety systems that had already been described as brittle, and which Musk further shrunk in an effort to cut costs. Under Musk, the company’s technical infrastructure proved increasingly prone to meltdowns, resulting in a series of glitches earlier this year affecting users’ ability to use the site.
   
Twitter layoffs continue under Elon Musk
 
      Along the way, Musk fired — or accepted the resignations of — key members of Twitter’s old guard, including its former CEO and CFO, as well as its general counsel, policy chief, chief privacy officer, chief information security officer, director of product management and head of trust and safety. Even some of the people who rose to become Musk’s trusted lieutenants at the company have already left.
   
      The workforce cuts have prompted repeated questions, including from US lawmakers and regulators, about the platform’s ability to respond to threats to security and privacy, along with elections, misinformation and hate speech. And thousands of former employees have accused Musk of providing fewer severance benefits than they were promised, and some also allege he’s delayed severance benefits and payments to cover executives’ work-related legal fees.
   
      In his zeal to restore what he describes as “free speech” to X, Musk has made numerous policy and product decisions that have altered what users can see on the platform.
   
      He reversed Twitter’s ban on former President Donald Trump based on an unscientific poll of his followers, after previously saying the decision would be up to a “content moderation council” that never materialized. He also reinstated the suspended accounts of white supremacists and conspiracy theorists. He temporarily suspended several journalists from Twitter for their reports on a third-party account devoted to tracking Musk’s private jet (despite previously criticizing the platform’s suspension practices).
   
      Under Musk’s leadership, the company removed specific protections for transgender people from Twitter’s hateful conduct policy. X made it easier for politicians and political candidates to qualify for newsworthiness exemptions from Twitter’s rules, when they would otherwise have their content restricted or removed. The platform overturned a 2019-era ban on political and issue advertising, and issued an updated, “zero-tolerance” policy on violent speech that was nevertheless vaguer and more subjective than what it replaced. And it updated Twitter’s privacy policies to say the company may allow users to opt-in to having their biometric information and job and education history collected by the platform.
   
      But perhaps no change has been as significant as Musk’s move to replace Twitter’s legacy verification (“blue check”) badges with a new form of verification that no longer carries the explicit assurance of authenticity.
   
      Days after his takeover, Musk debuted — then un-debuted, and later revived — a subscription feature that granted any user a blue verification badge if they paid for the platform’s $8 per month subscription plan. Critics warned that the system would lead to impersonation on a massive scale, and undermine a feature that once helped users to trust what they saw on the platform.
   
Elon Musk wants Twitter users to pay to be verified. It could create a new set of headaches for the company
 
      Sure enough, when the feature was first launched, Twitter faced a wave of verified impostors pretending to be everyone from Nintendo to LeBron James. After the platform revoked the badges of accounts who’d been verified under the old system, Musk offered to personally pay for verification for James and several other frustrated, high-profile users.
   
      Under the new system, users who paid for verification have their posts boosted by the platform’s algorithm. And more recently, X rolled out an advertising revenue share program for verified users, rewarding those that drive engagement with payouts — creating potential financial incentives for engagement farmers and misinformation peddlers who share inflammatory or misleading claims.
   
      As it dismantles old ways of thinking about content moderation, X leaders have repeatedly touted “Community Notes,” an expanded version of the “Birdwatch” user-generated moderation system that Twitter launched in 2021. X said this week that Community Notes now has more than 100,000 volunteer user-moderators in 44 countries who are participating in adding contextual labels to content on the platform.
   
      But numerous reports have suggested that Community Notes is struggling to meet its mission, burdened by issues like delays in users adding labels and bad actors attempting to game the system. (Yaccarino said in Thursday’s statement that Community Notes are getting faster, and that “this product is not perfect, but it is improving rapidly.”)
   
      In the meantime, Musk has also antagonized and pushed away many journalists who previously contributed to the spread of reliable information on the platform. Most notably, NPR and PBS abandoned the platform entirely in April after X labeled them as “state-affiliated media,” a designation the broadcasters said misleadingly implied they receive substantial backing from government entities or are not editorially independent. The platform later changed the label to “government-affiliated media” and then did away with it altogether, but the outlets have not returned.
   
      Many of Musk’s content and product decisions have also led to what civil society groups have reported as a troubling spread of hateful speech on the platform.
   
      In the early days of Musk’s takeover, many of Twitter’s largest advertisers — including the likes of General Mills and the Volkswagen Group — paused their spending over concerns about X’s layoffs, content moderation capabilities and general uncertainty about the platform’s future.
   
      The mass advertiser pullback tanked the company’s revenue, and it still has yet to fully recover. Musk has lashed out over the brand revolt, accusing his critics of deliberate sabotage and even going so far as to sue one watchdog group, the Center for Countering Digital Hate, and threatening to sue the Anti-Defamation League, alleging they damaged the brand with claims about surging hate speech on X.
   
      For its part, X has claimed hate speech is down and has touted new brand safety controls that purport to allow advertisers to restrict what kinds of content their ads can run next to. But even those safety offerings appeared to run into some early road bumps.
   
      The company’s leaders have offered conflicting views on the state of its finances — making it unclear when and if X’s business can be revived.
   
X is ‘close to breakeven’ says CEO Linda Yaccarino
 
      Musk said in July that the company remained cash flow negative because of a 50% decline in ad revenue and heavy debt load. A month later, Yaccarino said many top advertisers had returned and the company was “close to breakeven.” The next month, Musk said US advertising revenue was “still down 60%.” Weeks later, Yaccarino said the company could return to profitability early next year.
   
      Meanwhile, the banks that lent to Musk to finance his takeover are still struggling to offload the debt due in part to the billionaire’s chaotic leadership, the Wall Street Journal reported this week.
   
      Yaccarino’s ascension to CEO in June signaled Musk’s commitment to winning back advertisers; her track record as an NBCU ad executive, along with the cheery persona she projected on X, seemed to foretell a brighter future for the company. But as Musk has continued to make off-hand announcements about the company’s roadmap, at times seemingly taking Yaccarino by surprise, outsiders have widely wondered about the true extent of Yaccarino’s authority and influence within the company.
   
      In an interview last month, Yaccarino stressed that she does have autonomy from Musk as CEO. “Elon works on the technology and dreams up what’s next,” she said. “I bring it to market.”
   
      Through it all, Musk has become the platform’s most consistent main character, weighing in on the largest issues of the day whether he is informed about them or not. When Paul Pelosi was brutally attacked in his own home, Musk baselessly amplified fringe conspiracy theories about the assault. He recommended that X users monitor the Israel-Hamas conflict by following an account known for spreading disinformation, before later deleting his post. He has obliquely defended “Dilbert” creator Scott Adams over racist comments and has condemned the financier George Soros, a frequent target of antisemitic conspiracy theories.
   
      Musk appears to harbor an obsession with his own popularity on the platform, reportedly pressuring engineers to boost his own posts in users’ feeds after complaining his posts got fewer views than President Joe Biden’s during the Super Bowl.
   
Elon Musk publicly mocks Twitter worker with disability who is unsure whether he’s been laid off
 
      In other contexts, Musk has leveraged his ownership of Twitter to promote politicians he personally favors, such as by helping to launch Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ presidential campaign by way of a live Spaces event plagued by technical glitches. A week after that event, Musk held another Spaces event to promote Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the vaccine skeptic and another presidential hopeful, and he promoted an interview between former Fox host Tucker Carlson and another republican contender, Vivek Ramaswamy. He has also hosted Benjamin Netanyahu, the conservative Israeli prime minister for a live discussion on X.  Musk has said he’s willing to host candidates from across the ideological spectrum, but so far few if any politicians whom Musk disagrees with have been promoted in similar events.
   
      And, in an attempt to prove that former Twitter executives deliberately discriminated against conservatives on the platform, Musk provided a handpicked group of journalists with selective access to company records. The resulting reports, known as The Twitter Files, purported to reveal a nefarious campaign of suppression. However, the internal communications actually corroborated existing accounts of how Twitter struggled to handle a 2020 New York Post article involving Hunter Biden and his laptop. Musk’s own lawyers later would go on to dispute the insinuations and allegations in The Twitter Files as they tried to prevent Trump from pursuing a case against the company in court.
   
      Musk has also used the platform to promote his other companies and to hit back at his detractors — everyone from former employees to various regulatory bodies scrutinizing his ownership of the platform.
   
      It is perhaps Musk’s all-consuming presence that has most undermined what users used to love about Twitter. The platform was once a place to hear from lots of different kinds of voices; where any given user might be leading the day’s “discourse” with the newsiest, most entertaining or controversial bit of content; where there was indeed sometimes toxicity, but it was generally overpowered by useful, up-to-the-minute news and commentary. Now, it’s the Musk show, and users increasingly seem inclined to tune out.

106,Elon Musk nods to biggest EV competition after Tesla’s 7% decline in third-quarter: ‘Their cars are highly competitive’,Yahoo Style UK,2023-11-02,Tesla’s 7% quarterly decline in electric vehicle deliveries gave Chinese automaker BYD some competitive legroom — and now ...,https://uk.style.yahoo.com/elon-musk-nods-biggest-ev-050000066.html,"Tesla’s 7% quarterly decline in electric vehicle deliveries gave Chinese automaker BYD some competitive legroom — and now Tesla CEO Elon Musk has called the Warren Buffet-backed company a formidable opponent. Tesla reported 2023 third-quarter deliveries of about 435,000 vehicles, falling short of Wall Street expectations of 455,000. Overall, the company produced 430,488 cars during the quarter — most of these were Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. This was a production decline from the previous quarter’s 480,000 vehicles. In a statement, Tesla said the decrease in production was due to downtimes because of necessary factory upgrades. Meanwhile, BYD delivered 431,603 fully-electric EVs in the third quarter, inching closer to Tesla. The company sold almost 950,000 fully electric EVs in 2022 compared to Tesla’s 1.3 million. Though Tesla is widely considered to be the global leader in EV production, a number of other companies are stepping up to the challenge. And the more the merrier — EVs release far fewer planet-warming gases than traditional cars and are an important part of the equation when it comes to transitioning to a cleaner transportation model. Plus, greater competition will likely drive more tech innovation and greater affordability for consumers. A decade ago, Musk laughed aloud when asked if he considered BYD a competitor. He has since changed his tune, tweeting, “That was many years ago. Their cars are highly competitive these days.” Tesla is also embroiled in an EV pickup rivalry with Rivian. Tesla even alleged in 2021 that at least 40 of its former employees had stolen battery technology and shared it with Rivian. Meanwhile, EV startup Lucid Motors is aiming to stake its claim in the market with the Lucid Air Sapphire, which it calls a “luxury electric super-sports sedan.” Though it seems that many companies would love to catch up to Tesla, “Chinese automakers are the most competitive in our experience,” Musk tweeted. In response, one person tweeted, “Competition is always good for the growth and advancement of technology.

The latest investigation adds to a pile of probes into Musk's company, including one that alleged they set up a secret team to suppress complaints from customers. Musk's electric vehicle company revealed in federal filings they have received subpoenas 'regarding certain matters associated with personal benefits, related parties, vehicle range and personnel decisions.' The latest investigation into Tesla, comes on the heels of the manufacturer's earning call, where the world's richest man struggled to explain the poor economic performance.   During an earnings call last week, Musk was 'close to tears' and 'blamed high interest rates' as profits fell to $1.85 billion, sending shares tumbling 15 percent at the time. Tesla revealed it has received said the Justice Department is investigating claims it lied about driving ranges Tesla owner Elon Musk was 'close to tears' defending his company's poor performance in an investor meeting. His company is now the target of several DOJ investigations The latest probe alleges Musk ordered the automaker to 'rig its electric cars' dashboards' to show an inflated range they could travel before running out of charge. The distance electric vehicles can travel before needing to charge has long been a sticking point of acceptance across the car-buying market.   The DOJ investigation also claimed a 'diversion team' was set up to suppress thousands of complaints from owners disappointed by their vehicle's performance. Employees were reportedly tasked with canceling as many service appointments as possible related to driving range problems.  Tesla owners have filed a lawsuit against the company alleging automatic software updates cut their cars driving range by 20 percent, forcing some to spend $15,000 on new batteries.  In April, a shocking report said Tesla employees would regularly share personal videos of customers that were recorded on the car's integrated cameras. Staffers said those who shared the funniest clips were rewarded with promotions and the use of company cars.  A SEC filing by Tesla said, 'during the second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain misappropriated data including, purportedly, among other things, non-public Tesla business and personal information.' Tesla said they notified all the individuals potentially affected by a data leak and a class action lawsuit against the company over it could have negative impacts on business. 'If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur in these or other possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand,' said the company. Federal data shows there have been at least 42 investigations into Tesla crashes since 2016, including 23 fatalities, two which were pedestrians and two motorcyclists. Tesla owners have filed a lawsuit against the company alleging automatic software updates cut their cars driving range by 20 percent  The DOJ is also probing Musk over Tesla perks he received since 2017, including company resources to build a secret home Investigations from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration all involve cases where driver systems such as Autopilot or so-called 'Full Self-Driving' were suspected of being used. In January, Tesla disclosed that the Justice Department had requested documents related to its Autopilot and 'Full Self-Driving' features. The DOJ is probing Musk over Tesla perks he received since 2017, including company resources to build a secret home.   The SEC has also opened a civil investigation into the claim company funds were used to build a glass mansion near the company Texas headquarters. Dubbed 'Project 42' and described inside the company as a mansion for Musk, the plans involved a dramatic glass-walled building near Tesla's gigafactory in Austin, the Journal previously reported.  DailyMail.com has reached out to Tesla for comment.

Sky News looks back at the billionaire's first year in charge of one of the world's biggest online platforms. By  Tom Acres, technology reporter   Friday 27 October 2023 03:10, UK Start with the big idea and deal with any issues down the line. That was the assessment of Elon Musk biographer Michael Vlismas a year ago when asked how the world's richest man might go about running Twitter. The SpaceX owner had just bought the bird app for $44bn (£38bn) with a vague goal of transforming it into an ""everything app"" called X. Modelled on China's WeChat, it could become your one-stop shop for not just getting into arguments online and posting memes, but video calls, podcasts, and even banking. All while being an internet town square, committed to free speech, where anyone's views have as much cache as a celebrity, news outlet, or academic - no matter how controversial. A noble goal, many would argue. But as Vlismas had indicated, a plan light on detail. And the execution - from huge lay-offs to putting verification behind subscriptions - has been debatable at best. ""He always has a grand vision, but in this instance the details have been a quagmire for him,"" says Vlismas. ""Perhaps it's showing you can't be everything to everyone - and that's the challenge with an 'everything app'. ""It's got to be a clear vision in terms of what he wants out of it."" A tumultuous timeline Musk's own Twitter timeline was rarely dull, so perhaps it should come as no surprise that once he ruled the roost, Twitter's own timeline would follow suit. His first act (other than carrying a sink into the firm's San Francisco HQ for the sake of a bad pun) was firing executives and thousands of employees quickly suffered the same fate. Skittish advertisers, concerned about Musk's stance on content moderation, helped see revenues fall and within a month even the prospect of bankruptcy was being mooted. Musk's flagship attempt to drive up company income was to offer verification ticks as a paid-for benefit in a subscription that has expanded to include features like an edit button and longer posts. A fake Tony Blair, OJ Simpson, and very naughty Super Mario later, it was clear there were flaws in this plan to allow anyone to pay to add the once-respected blue tick to their account. According to analysis by research group AMPLYFI, which used AI to judge user sentiment on Twitter over time, the furore was ""the initial catalyst for things turning sour"" for much of the platform's audience. ""It created chaos,"" says Drew Benvie, founder of communications agency Battenhall. ""People don't know if they're talking to the real deal."" Ahead of a year that will include a US presidential election, and with ever-improving AI deepfakes, it's an issue that could become even more serious. Other changes have included reinstating banned accounts like those of Andrew Tate and Donald Trump, raising further concerns about the proliferation of hate speech on the platform. The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a group X has sued over its damning assessments of its content moderation standards, says Musk has welcomed back a host of bad actors ""with open arms"". Speaking to mark the Muskiversary, CCDH founder Imran Ahmed condemned it as a ""grave betrayal of users, advertisers and the wider public"". That, coupled with the gutting of the company's trust and safety teams, damaged Twitter's reputation as a place to seek out verified news - an issue brought home by the Israel-Hamas war. And then, of course, came rebranding Twitter into X. A name so embedded in modern society that ""tweet"" had entered the Oxford and Cambridge dictionaries, now one which would have once done nothing but arouse suspicion in your browsing history. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  'He has decimated the business' Musk said Twitter's transition from talking shop to everything app meant the name no longer made sense, and has claimed the rebranding reflects his ambitions. Of course, some may have spotted an obvious trend and concluded he simply likes the letter X. Not only is it part of the name of his successful rocket company, but one of his children; his AI start-up; and an internet banking firm he co-founded that became PayPal. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free Social media expert Beth Caroll, of Wunderman Thompson, is sceptical of Musk's apparent plans. ""There's a vague possibility he could have this bigger picture idea, this super app like a WeChat, and if he were to deliver that then he might have a viable product,"" she says. ""But for now he has just decimated the business."" Indeed, earlier this year the company was valued at less than a third of the $44bn Musk paid for it. Even the hiring of Linda Yaccarino, an experienced figure from NBCUniversal, as chief executive has done little to repair the monetary or reputational damage. It's worth remembering, Caroll says, that Musk did try awfully hard to back out of buying Twitter, and all the challenges he's faced are perhaps a sign of why. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Can Musk really have it all? Yet despite it all, for its remaining users - whether enthusiastic or reluctant - X remains best at this particular type of social media, where real-time updates reign supreme.  For Dr Annmarie Hanlon, lecturer in digital and social marketing at Cranfield School of Management, would-be rivals from the ""clunky"" Mastodon to Meta's ""basic"" Threads have failed to offer a comparable experience. ""The everything app is still a work in progress,"" she says. ""But when Threads opened, everyone said 'this is the death of Twitter'. And it hasn't been."" Of course, given the contempt Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have for each other, don't expect the Meta boss to abandon his company's new app anytime soon. And when it comes to ""the death of Twitter"", Musk would happily claim responsibility, with X the phoenix rising from its ashes. But unlike the rockets of SpaceX (well, most of them), biographer Vlismas doubts how far it can fly.  ""With SpaceX, the grand vision is colonising Mars,"" he says. ""But the core purpose is launching rockets into space and it's very effective at that. ""If you wanted to do anything else with it, it dilutes that purpose. ""The longer X is a bit muddled like this, the worse it is. And the more people will turn away.""

Here, we take a look at his love life and the 11 kids that will inherit his immense fortune By Elon Musk is known for being the richest person in the world with an estimated fortune of $225.3 billion (£185 billion), and one day all of that wealth is going to be passed down to his kids. The businessman, who has owned social media site X - previously known as Twitter - for one year today, welcomed his 11th child this month. The latest addition to his family means Elon now has over a dozen children with three different women, including Canadian author Justine Musk, singer Grimes and employee Shivron Zilis. The father-of-11 has also dated some very famous faces in the spotlight over the years, including actresses Amber Heard and Talulah Riley. Read more Elon Musk teases new Twitter subscription service with 'no ads' and 'lower cost'  Justine Musk was Elon's college sweetheart and his first wife. The pair met while at Queen's University in Ontario, Canada, in the nineties and welcomed their first son Nevada in 2002, two years after marrying. Sadly, Nevada tragically died from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) when he was just 10 weeks old. ""There is nothing worse than losing a child,"" Elon said at the time. ""My firstborn son died in my arms. I felt his heartbeat."" The couple went on to have five more children together; a set of twins in 2004 and a set of triplets in 2006. But their relationship didn't last and they divorced in 2008. In a piece for Marie Claire in 2010, Justine opened up about their marriage claiming that she was just a ""starter wife"" for Elon. ""It was a dream lifestyle, privileged and surreal,"" she said. ""But the whirlwind of glitter couldn't disguise a growing void at the core. Elon was obsessed with his work."" Elon started dating actress Talulah Riley and proposed just six weeks after filing for divorce from Justine. The pair went on to marry in 2010. Their marriage only lasted two years before they divorced in 2012, but the couple reconciled and married for the second time in 2013. However, in 2016 their marriage ended for good and they got their second divorce.  Despite divorcing him twice, Talulah is still on good terms with Elon. Speaking about what their marriage was like, she told The Independent: ""Elon was great. He had me alongside for all of that. So it wasn't like I was stuck in a mansion in Bel Air like a trophy wife, which would not have been fun. I did, of course, witness that for others. But luckily, that was not my fate.""  Following his final split from Riley, Elon went on to date Aquaman actress Amber Heard in 2016, shortly after her divorce from Johnny Depp. But in his defamation lawsuit in 2019, Johnny accused Amber of cheating on him with Elon, claiming the pair actually started their relationship in March 2016, a month after he and Amber married.  In 2020, it was also claimed in legal depositions that Elon had had a three-way hook-up with Amber Heard and model Cara Delevingne. Despite the allegations, Elon has denied the threesome and also denied that Amber had an affair with him. He told Page Six: ""Cara and I are friends, but we've never been intimate. She would confirm this. Also, I wish to confirm again that Amber and I only started going out about a month after her divorce filing. I don't think I was ever even in the vicinity of Amber during their marriage!"" Amber and Elon's relationship didn't last very long, they split after less than a year in 2017 due to their busy work schedules. In April 2018, Elon began dating singer Grimes, whose real name is Claire Boucher. The pair announced they welcomed their first son in May 2020, who they famously named X Æ A-12, but they had to change it to X Æ A-Xii. A year later, the pair confirmed they had separated but said they wanted to continue having children together, with Grimes telling Vanity Fair they ""wanted at least three or four"". Speaking about their split on social media at the time, she wrote: ""Me and E have broken up *again* since the writing of this article haha, but he's my best friend and the love of my life, and my life and art are forever dedicated to The Mission now."" Elon told Page Six: ""We are semi-separated but still love each other, see each other frequently and are on great terms."" Announcing the secret birth of their daughter, Exa Dark Sideræl Musk, who they call Y, to Vanity Fair in March 2022, Grimes confirmed that she was back together with Elon as she referred to him as her ""boyfriend"". But just hours after the story was published, Grimes confirmed that they had split once again. Then in September 2023, it was revealed they had welcomed a third child, a son named Techno Mechanicus, who Elon calls Tau.  In July 2022, news broke that Elon had secretly fathered twins with a woman called Shivon Zilis, a top executive at his company Neuralink. In November 2021, she and Elon welcomed twins together, just weeks before he welcomed his second child with Grimes. It's not known what type of relationship Elon has with Shivon, but their secret children were revealed after court documents filed in April showed that they had requested for the twins to have their father's last name.

The owner of X, formerly Twitter, recommended two accounts on Sunday. He wrote: “For following the war in real-time, @WarMonitors and @sentdefender are good. It is also worth following direct sources on the ground. Please add interesting options in the replies below.” The @WarMonitors account told a user in June “go worship a jew lil bro” while both accounts helped to spread a false claim in May that an explosion had occurred at the Pentagon. Emerson T Brooking, a researcher at the Atlantic Council’s digital forensic research lab, said the @sentdefender account regularly posted “wrong and unverifiable things”. Musk has since deleted his post and disputed a War Monitor post describing Gaza fighters as “martyrs”. He wrote: “While reporting both sides is fair, please use maximally accurate words or I must withdraw my recommendation to follow your account.” Fake social media accounts are spreading false information about the Israel-Hamas conflict, with X and TikTok among the affected platforms, according to disinformation specialists. One in five social media accounts participating in online conversations about the Hamas attacks and their aftermath are fake, according to Cyabra, an Israeli analysis firm. Cyabra, which has monitored US election disinformation and tracked bot accounts on Twitter historically, found that approximately 30,000 fake accounts have been spreading pro-Hamas disinformation or gathering sensitive details about their targets. The company said the fake accounts – many of them automated bot accounts not operated by human hand – were particularly active on X and TikTok but were also appearing on other platforms. A journalist at BBC Verify, the corporation’s factchecking and disinformation unit, said there had been a “deluge” of false posts on X since the attacks, including from an account pretending to be a BBC reporter. Shayan Sardarizadeh posted on X that untrue posts from verified accounts, which pay for a blue tick, had been boosted across the platform. He said X’s crowd-sourced factchecking function, community notes, could not cope with the number of false posts. “I’ve been factchecking on Twitter for years, and there’s always plenty of misinformation during major events. But the deluge of false posts in the last two days, many boosted via Twitter Blue [now X Premium], is something else. Neither factcheckers nor Community Notes can keep up with this.” Thread: Online misinformation about the conflict between Hamas and Israel - day threeThis video doesn't show a salvo of rockets fired by Hamas towards Israel.It's from the Syrian war, and was shared online in 2020. pic.twitter.com/62xm6tpGu7 An account imitating the Jerusalem Post, since suspended, published a false claim on X that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had been taken to hospital, while footage from the Syrian conflict has been falsely labelled as being from Gaza.

Rating: On Oct. 11, 2023, SpaceXMania.com published an article claiming that Elon Musk tweeted he would rather break his leg than see Taylor Swift during an NFL game, presumably in reference to her cameos during NFL TV coverage due to her relationship to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. The article claimed: Elon Musk: “I’d Rather Break My Leg Than See Taylor Swift During An NFL Game” In a surprising revelation on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, Elon Musk commented on pop superstar Taylor Swift’s recent appearances at NFL games, stating, “I’d rather break my leg than see Taylor Swift during an NFL game.” The billionaire and tech tycoon’s comment quickly became one of the platform’s top trending topics, with fans and critics alike weighing in on the unexpected sentiment. A Facebook account for SpaceXMedia, SpaceX Lovers, shared the article in a post that attracted comments from users who seemed to believe the story was real and support Musk's alleged comment. But, the article was not an account of real events — that is, it did not describe an actual tweet from Musk about Swift. It was intended to be satirical. SpaceXMania included a ""satire"" label above the article's headline and a disclaimer at the bottom reading, ""Note: This is 100% Satire and not real news.""

Is this the end of the world's ""public town square""?  On October 27, 2022, the world's richest man, Elon Musk, officially took ownership of Twitter Inc., tweeting, ""The bird is freed."" Shortly thereafter commenced the firing of top executives, a series of controversial layoffs (about half of its 7,500 staff) and the rebranding of one of the world's best-known brands to ""X."" Launched in Silicon Valley in 2006, Twitter started out as a microblogging platform that allowed users to share 140-character posts, or ""tweets."" By December 2022, Twitter had over 368 million active users worldwide, according to data from eMarketer/Insider Intelligence, and was credited with facilitating social protest movements from the Arab Spring and Black Lives Matter to the #MeToo movement. Twitter is by no means the biggest social media platform in terms of the number of active users — it trails Meta's Facebook and Instagram and others by far — but it has long punched above its weight in terms of influence. Political leaders, companies, news media organizations, journalists and celebrities have all used the platform to communicate and brand-build among a largely media-savvy global community. Before closing his $44 billion (€41.5 billion) deal to buy Twitter, Musk proclaimed the platform served as ""the de facto public town square"" and questioned its commitment to freedom of speech. ""Failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy. What should be done?"" Musk asked his tens of millions of followers.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Despite promising not to turn Twitter into a ""free-for-all hellscape,"" Musk's answer was to fire large numbers of content moderators, dissolve its trust and safety council and reinstate the accounts of right-wing extremists and conspiracy theorists, including white nationalist Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and Andrew Anglin, the founder of the white supremacist website The Daily Stormer. Its press department was closed in November 2022 and now answers all press inquiries with a poop emoji. In the weeks following the takeover, a study by researchers at Tufts University in the US found that ""post-Musk takeover, the quality of the conversation has decayed, with more extremists and purveyors of hateful content testing the boundaries of what Twitter might allow."" Now, one year on, critics say the so-called ""public town square"" has become flooded with hate speech and misinformation.  All this is important because ""what we find on social media translates into real-world outcomes,"" says Raphaela Andres, a researcher at the Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research in Mannheim (ZEW) and co-author of a study examining the impact of legislation to combat hate speech on Twitter. The Center for Countering Digital Hate says hate and discrimination have ""skyrocketed"" on the platform under Musk and now campaigns for big brands to stop advertising on the site. In response, Musk filed a lawsuit accusing the CCDH of damaging its relationship with advertisers. He's also threatened to sue the Anti-Defamation League, a US-based civil rights group, saying the ADL was trying to ""kill"" the social media platform by ""falsely accusing it and me of being antisemitic."" By May 2023, market analysts at Fidelity, an asset management fund that owns a stake in X Holdings Corp., found that Twitter had lost around a third of its purchase value since Musk's takeover. In July, Musk freely admitted the company had lost almost half of its advertising revenue since he took the helm and marketing consultancy. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Another big change under Musk has been the introduction of fees for the famous ""blue checks"" used to verify users' identities. Suddenly the blue check was available to anyone willing to pay for it, and those who refused had their verification removed. Sacha Altay is an experimental psychologist working on misinformation and (mis)trust at the University of Zurich. He says that while it's clear that the spread of hate speech and misinformation has increased on Twitter, there are very few studies comparing the phenomenon across different platforms. ""[Musk] did a lot of things that, of course, did not improve the quality of the discussion, but it's difficult to tell whether it is really worse than on other platforms,"" Altay told DW. ""Is it worse than on TikTok? Maybe, but I don't think we have really good data to be able to speak to that.""  On the specific issue of misinformation, Altay says it has been a problem on Twitter since the very beginning and that it's mainly spread not by bots but by people with real-world power and influence. ""Before, with the blue check, it was already bad, now it's just worse. A lot of misinformation already came from 'blue-check people' like politicians,"" Altay says. In response to the introduction of the Digital Services Act (DSA) in the EU, which sets forth rules for preventing the spread of harmful content, banning or limiting certain user-targeting practices, and sharing some internal data with regulators, rumors circulated that Musk was considering removing the service from Europe.  In September, Musk took on the German government. He shared a call to vote for the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) suggesting that Europe is being overrun by refugees and the German government is to blame, as it finances the rescue of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea. ""Is the German public aware of this?"" Musk tweeted. To this, the official account of the German Foreign Office responded, ""Yes, it's called saving lives."" As the ""public town square"" becomes ever more flooded with hate speech and misinformation, the question arises of whether it's time to pack up and leave — and if it is, then where to? Some of Germany's more high-profile politicians, such as Lower Saxony's Premier Stephan Weil or the center-left Social Democrats' co-chair Saskia Esken. wiped their private accounts. But most German politicians and media outlets continue to have a presence on the platform.  One exception is the US non-profit National Public Radio, or NPR. After X labeled it as ""US state-affiliated media"" in April 2023, NRP, which had 8.7 million followers, left Twitter. Six months later, Harvard's Nieman Foundation reported on a memo circulated to NPR staff saying traffic had dropped by just a single percentage point as a result of leaving the platform. In a recent Medium blog post, influential Canadian-British blogger, journalist and author Cory Doctorow wrote, ""The problem with Twitter isn't that this important service is run by the wrong mercurial, mediocre billionaire: it's that hundreds of millions of people are at the mercy of any foolish corporate leader."" ""I don't think [Twitter's] over, I don't think it will die,"" says Andres, the ZEW researcher. ""I think there will be different alternatives coming up like Mastodon, Blue Sky. I don't expect them to become as big as Twitter, I think we won't have one overarching platform anymore. I hope that at some point the people can communicate between those platforms … and I think that's the direction that we will go."" Edited by: Rina Goldenberg"

How Elon Musk turned Twitter upside down,Metro,2023-10-21,"On October 26, 2022, the world’s richest man Elon Musk carried a large porcelain kitchen fixture into Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters. ‘Let that sink in,’ he famously tweeted ...",https://metro.co.uk/2023/10/21/elon-musk-bought-twitter-a-year-ago-and-it-has-been-a-rollercoaster-19695629/?ico=zone-widget_home_platform,"By Jasper Hamill, Science and technology reporter On October 26, 2022, the world’s richest man Elon Musk carried a large porcelain kitchen fixture into Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters.  ‘Let that sink in,’ he famously tweeted, after showing up to work with an actual sink and announcing that he was the new owner of Twitter.  Now, after 12 rollercoaster months, the impact of his decision has definitely sunk in.  Musk was already a huge social media star when he decided to buy Twitter in April 2022, beginning a complex acquisition process. He tried to pull out after claiming the social network had failed to crack down on spambots – automated accounts which mimic human profiles in order to spread content on social media – but a judge forced him to go through with the $44 billion sale. Then he moved quickly, sacking senior staff including former CEO Parag Agrawal and starting a long series of layoffs in which employees were fired by email and others were given their marching orders after criticising the Tesla and SpaceX founder on Twitter. What came next was a dramatic overhaul of the social network, scrapping the blue tick and replacing it with a paid scheme in which users could verify their account starting at £9.60 a month.  It was the first salvo in a string of sometimes controversial updates which included a bid to limit the number of tweets users could view in one day.  By September 2023, Musk was suggesting all users would have to pay to access his social network, and earlier this week began charging new users in New Zealand and the Philippines $1 a year for basic accounts. Entering Twitter HQ â let that sink in! pic.twitter.com/D68z4K2wq7 However, perhaps the most talked-about update came in July, when he decided to scrap the name Twitter and rename his social network X – leaving users confused about what to call tweets in the billionaire’s brave new world. It also gave way to the photo opp of paparazzi’s dreams when Musk stopped traffic to pull down the old Twitter sign from its San Francisco HQ, which at one point with the sign half removed, only the words ‘twit’ and ‘er’ were left visible. The awkward juxtaposition served as a neat visual representation of the incredulous reaction sparked by his decision to rebrand Twitter – a much-loved and iconic social network famed for its blue bird and ‘fail whale’ icons. Reflecting on the last 12 months of Elon’s Twitter takeover, Dr Annmarie Hanlon, senior lecturer in digital and social media marketing at Cranfield School of Management, tells Metro.co.uk how Twitter was once ‘the breaking news channel and a place you could hear a wide range of opinions’.  However, she warns that the platform’s future now looks ‘increasingly uncertain and volatile’ and calls on the billionaire to ‘build the community rather than destroy it’.  ‘For many the hasty rebrand to “X” left the platform with a malevolent and uninviting aesthetic,’ she continued.  ‘Some regard its appearance as a force for bad, instead of an intended force for good. Musk’s takeover of Twitter has profoundly impacted user experience, namely through a surge in hate speech, misinformation, and bots across the platform.  ‘Restoring civility and trust should be his top priority. Users and brands want a safe, constructive platform.’ Just a few weeks after buying Twitter, Musk asked users to vote on whether there should be an ‘amnesty’ for people who had been banned from the site, as long as they were not spammers or had broken the law. After the vote, he then allowed figures such as Kanye West, Andrew Tate, Donald Trump and the far-right extremist Nick Fuentes back onto the platform.  It was a move that prompted outcry from many campaigners who claim that hate speech has proliferated on Twitter and X over the last 12 months.  At the end of 2022, analysts from the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) alleged that the number of tweets containing the n-word had tripled since Musk’s takeover. However, Musk claimed the opposite was true and that hate speech had been reduced on his watch. His company X Corp is now suing CCDH, claiming it cost the platform ‘tens of millions of dollars’ in advertising revenue. CCDH did not respond to our requests for further comment.  The fault lines of the free speech debate were never more obvious following Hamas terrorists’ attack on Israel earlier this month, prompting the EU to open a formal investigation into X in relation to the spread of ‘terrorist and violent content’ relating to the conflict – and disinformation.  Again, Musk questioned the allegations and wrote: ‘Our policy is that everything is open source and transparent, an approach that I know the EU supports. Please list the violations you allude to on X, so that that [sic] the public can see them. ‘Merci beaucoup.’ Linda Yaccarino, appointed CEO of X in May after Musk posted a poll asking if he should step down, did provide a more comprehensive response. Following the attacks, Countdown maths whizz Rachel Riley posted: ‘Twitter is a cesspit, even worse than before Musk took over.’ However, Musk still has many supporters who back his crusade for free speech.  On the day of Hamas’s attack, Dominic Cummings, Brexit architect and grand vizier to Boris Johnson, posted: ‘Today reminds me how happy I am @ElonMusk bought Twitter – if you look at mainstream news, including BBC, you see censorship and propaganda everywhere to limit damage to Hamas.’ Metro.co.uk approached Cummings for comment but he did not respond.  Michael Fertik, a well-known Silicon Valley venture investor who is the founder and managing director of venture capital firm Heroic Ventures, tells Metro.co.uk: ‘The question is not whether Elon has run Twitter and X better than an armchair commentator on X would have done. It’s whether he ran it better than the apparently self-unaware woke junta did before he bought it. Air Force officer goes public with terrifying UFO encounter: 'It's coming right for us' Pentagon UFO boss steps down after explosive admission £160,000 flying car you have to build yourself sails through first flight Scientists create 'Frankenstein' chimera monkey that glows green ‘The answer is, so far, a resounding yes.  ‘Freer speech is winning again. And economically, he had the guts to reduce an obviously enormously bloated staff, which loss-making companies should probably do more often. I don’t love all of his off-the-cuff “philosophy”, but probably neither does he, after sleeping on it.’ Ever since the Musk takeover, his political and ideological opponents have threatened to leave X and sign up to other platforms, such as Mastodon. Mark Zuckerberg even launched a Twitter competitor, Threads, which does not appear to have been the success its founder hoped for.  So far, the expected exodus has not taken place. In June 2023, Musk posted figures showing that the number of monthly users of X had reached a ‘new high’ and soared to more than 540 million. Recent figures from the analytics and business intelligence firm GWS revealed that X’s average daily user numbers have ‘remained steady’ in both the US and UK since early July. It continues to average around 22 million active users each day in the US and 6 million active users each day in the UK. Daily active users of Meta’s Threads have ‘fallen significantly’ in both markets. Dr Paul Carter, CEO of GWS, tells Metro: ‘Elon Musk’s major overhaul of Twitter’s branding, adopting the X name and logo, might have attracted controversy, especially at a time when the company faces the looming threat of a well-funded rival in Threads.  ‘However, real-time mobile data from social media users across the UK and the US shows Twitter continues to hold steady despite external threats. ‘The same, however, cannot be said for its main new rival Threads and its parent company Meta. The mass exodus from one platform to the other just hasn’t occurred.’ Dr Alex Gunz, lecturer in marketing at Alliance Manchester Business School, said Twitter is protected from competition by a phenomenon known as a ‘network lock-in’ effect.  ‘The most valuable aspect about social media platforms is the fact that everyone else is there too,’ he says. ‘This herd effect seems to have helped Twitter to stay afloat since Musk’s takeover. Membership has shrunk somewhat, but the exodus never hit a critical mass.’ This situation could change if enough people decide to jump ship and move to a different social network.  ‘If enough users are dissatisfied with Twitter and turn to a sufficiently plausible alternative, then the trickle of migration could well hit a tipping point,’ Dr Gunz continued. ‘If enough people move to a new place, then the lock-in goes with them, and so does Twitter’s monopoly.’ Although the user base has not yet deserted X, it faces ‘a significant challenge when it comes to attracting and retaining users’, Arden University’s Dr Syed Tarek tells Metro. ‘With Elon Musk’s recent approach of prioritising blue tick subscribers over ads, it’s possible that many non-subscribers, who are responsible for creating and consuming the majority of the platform’s content, may feel alienated,’ says Dr Tarek, deputy head of school of leadership and management at the private university. ‘It seems that X users are actively seeking alternatives, but it’s likely that the platform will experience a gradual decline rather than a sudden collapse. There’s a clear need for other platforms to catch up to Twitter’s capabilities before users commit to the switch for the long-term.’ While Elon wants to turn X into a ‘super app’ – the name of ‘one app to rule them all’ services like WeChat in China, which enables users to do everything from sharing photos to making payments – the road ahead looks far from smooth for the social media site. Kirsty Minns, executive creative director and partner at Mother Design, tells Metro.co.uk that Elon’s unique management style poses its own risks.  ‘He appears to be using the same “break it til you make it” playbook seen in the early days of both Tesla and SpaceX – but the big problem is that this playbook applies to start-ups, not a globally recognised brand with an already established set of values,’ she says.  ‘Twitter already meant something to people, they’d given it a purpose. Now, it appears that users are not at the centre of the brand and Musk has total freedom to do what he likes, without any accountability”. A hint of a potential challenge ahead came in August 2023, when Musk announced plans to collect and store users’ biometric data for safety, security and identification purposes.  Alex Laurie, SVP at the digital identity platform ForgeRock, told Metro.co.uk about one example of a potential problem which could push users into moving to another social network. He said that a ‘subtle change’ to X’s privacy policy like this suggests Elon Musk is capable of ‘acting on whims without thinking things through’.  Laurie says: ‘This could cause serious revenue issues for X as our own research, conducted earlier this year, shows that 44% of UK users would stop using X if it implemented a requirement for identity verification. Given existing consumer distrust of social media companies, especially when handling credentials and online identities, we may witness an acceleration in user drop-off if X implements this decision.’ The biometric data issue is just one example of the many challenges Musk faces as he strives to build the first super app in the West.  As we move into the second year of Musk’s ownership of X, little is certain about its future and it is more or less impossible to predict the plans of its owner.  ‘What’s next?’ Olivia Wedderburn, executive social influence director at TMW Unlimited, a creative agency based in London, tells Metro. ‘It’s hard to say, but my bet is in the cold hard ground.’

Those who fail to comply will face fines of up to $18 million or 10 percent of annual global revenue, potentially billions of pounds for the most prominent firms. In the most extreme cases, tech bosses could even face prison.

Mr Yousaf, who was Scottish justice secretary at the time, took part in a Holyrood debate on challenging racism following the murder of George Floyd in May 2020. He said in the clip: ""Some people have been surprised or taken aback by my mention on my social media that at 99 percent of the meetings that I go to, I am the only non-white person in the room.

Here, we take a look at his love life and the 11 kids that will inherit his immense fortune Elon Musk is known for being the richest person in the world with an estimated fortune of $225.3 billion (£185 billion), and one day all of that wealth is going to be passed down to his kids. The businessman, who has owned social media site X - previously known as Twitter - for one year today, welcomed his 11th child this month. The latest addition to his family means Elon now has over a dozen children with three different women, including Canadian author Justine Musk, singer Grimes and employee Shivron Zilis. The father-of-11 has also dated some very famous faces in the spotlight over the years, including actresses Amber Heard and Talulah Riley.  Justine Musk was Elon's college sweetheart and his first wife. The pair met while at Queen's University in Ontario, Canada, in the nineties and welcomed their first son Nevada in 2002, two years after marrying. Sadly, Nevada tragically died from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) when he was just 10 weeks old. ""There is nothing worse than losing a child,"" Elon said at the time. ""My firstborn son died in my arms. I felt his heartbeat."" The couple went on to have five more children together; a set of twins in 2004 and a set of triplets in 2006. But their relationship didn't last and they divorced in 2008. In a piece for Marie Claire in 2010, Justine opened up about their marriage claiming that she was just a ""starter wife"" for Elon. ""It was a dream lifestyle, privileged and surreal,"" she said. ""But the whirlwind of glitter couldn't disguise a growing void at the core. Elon was obsessed with his work."" Elon started dating actress Talulah Riley and proposed just six weeks after filing for divorce from Justine. The pair went on to marry in 2010. Their marriage only lasted two years before they divorced in 2012, but the couple reconciled and married for the second time in 2013. However, in 2016 their marriage ended for good and they got their second divorce.  Despite divorcing him twice, Talulah is still on good terms with Elon. Speaking about what their marriage was like, she told The Independent: ""Elon was great. He had me alongside for all of that. So it wasn't like I was stuck in a mansion in Bel Air like a trophy wife, which would not have been fun. I did, of course, witness that for others. But luckily, that was not my fate.""  Following his final split from Riley, Elon went on to date Aquaman actress Amber Heard in 2016, shortly after her divorce from Johnny Depp. But in his defamation lawsuit in 2019, Johnny accused Amber of cheating on him with Elon, claiming the pair actually started their relationship in March 2016, a month after he and Amber married.  In 2020, it was also claimed in legal depositions that Elon had had a three-way hook-up with Amber Heard and model Cara Delevingne. Despite the allegations, Elon has denied the threesome and also denied that Amber had an affair with him. He told Page Six: ""Cara and I are friends, but we've never been intimate. She would confirm this. Also, I wish to confirm again that Amber and I only started going out about a month after her divorce filing. I don't think I was ever even in the vicinity of Amber during their marriage!"" Amber and Elon's relationship didn't last very long, they split after less than a year in 2017 due to their busy work schedules. In April 2018, Elon began dating singer Grimes, whose real name is Claire Boucher. The pair announced they welcomed their first son in May 2020, who they famously named X Æ A-12, but they had to change it to X Æ A-Xii. A year later, the pair confirmed they had separated but said they wanted to continue having children together, with Grimes telling Vanity Fair they ""wanted at least three or four"". Speaking about their split on social media at the time, she wrote: ""Me and E have broken up *again* since the writing of this article haha, but he's my best friend and the love of my life, and my life and art are forever dedicated to The Mission now."" Elon told Page Six: ""We are semi-separated but still love each other, see each other frequently and are on great terms."" Announcing the secret birth of their daughter, Exa Dark Sideræl Musk, who they call Y, to Vanity Fair in March 2022, Grimes confirmed that she was back together with Elon as she referred to him as her ""boyfriend"". But just hours after the story was published, Grimes confirmed that they had split once again. Then in September 2023, it was revealed they had welcomed a third child, a son named Techno Mechanicus, who Elon calls Tau.  In July 2022, news broke that Elon had secretly fathered twins with a woman called Shivon Zilis, a top executive at his company Neuralink. In November 2021, she and Elon welcomed twins together, just weeks before he welcomed his second child with Grimes. It's not known what type of relationship Elon has with Shivon, but their secret children were revealed after court documents filed in April showed that they had requested for the twins to have their father's last name.

 Start with the big idea and deal with any issues down the line. That was the assessment of Elon Musk biographer Michael Vlismas a year ago when asked how the world's richest man might go about running Twitter. The SpaceX owner had just bought the bird app for $44bn (£38bn) with a vague goal of transforming it into an ""everything app"" called X. Modelled on China's WeChat, it could become your one-stop shop for not just getting into arguments online and posting memes, but video calls, podcasts, and even banking. All while being an internet town square, committed to free speech, where anyone's views have as much cache as a celebrity, news outlet, or academic - no matter how controversial. A noble goal, many would argue. But as Vlismas had indicated, a plan light on detail. And the execution - from huge lay-offs to putting verification behind subscriptions - has been debatable at best. ""He always has a grand vision, but in this instance the details have been a quagmire for him,"" says Vlismas. ""Perhaps it's showing you can't be everything to everyone - and that's the challenge with an 'everything app'. ""It's got to be a clear vision in terms of what he wants out of it."" A tumultuous timeline Musk's own Twitter timeline was rarely dull, so perhaps it should come as no surprise that once he ruled the roost, Twitter's own timeline would follow suit. His first act (other than carrying a sink into the firm's San Francisco HQ for the sake of a bad pun) was firing executives and thousands of employees quickly suffered the same fate. Skittish advertisers, concerned about Musk's stance on content moderation, helped see revenues fall and within a month even the prospect of bankruptcy was being mooted. Musk's flagship attempt to drive up company income was to offer verification ticks as a paid-for benefit in a subscription that has expanded to include features like an edit button and longer posts. A fake Tony Blair, OJ Simpson, and very naughty Super Mario later, it was clear there were flaws in this plan to allow anyone to pay to add the once-respected blue tick to their account. According to analysis by research group AMPLYFI, which used AI to judge user sentiment on Twitter over time, the furore was ""the initial catalyst for things turning sour"" for much of the platform's audience. ""It created chaos,"" says Drew Benvie, founder of communications agency Battenhall. ""People don't know if they're talking to the real deal."" Ahead of a year that will include a US presidential election, and with ever-improving AI deepfakes, it's an issue that could become even more serious. Other changes have included reinstating banned accounts like those of Andrew Tate and Donald Trump, raising further concerns about the proliferation of hate speech on the platform. The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a group X has sued over its damning assessments of its content moderation standards, says Musk has welcomed back a host of bad actors ""with open arms"". Speaking to mark the Muskiversary, CCDH founder Imran Ahmed condemned it as a ""grave betrayal of users, advertisers and the wider public"". That, coupled with the gutting of the company's trust and safety teams, damaged Twitter's reputation as a place to seek out verified news - an issue brought home by the Israel-Hamas war. And then, of course, came rebranding Twitter into X. A name so embedded in modern society that ""tweet"" had entered the Oxford and Cambridge dictionaries, now one which would have once done nothing but arouse suspicion in your browsing history. 'He has decimated the business' Musk said Twitter's transition from talking shop to everything app meant the name no longer made sense, and has claimed the rebranding reflects his ambitions. Of course, some may have spotted an obvious trend and concluded he simply likes the letter X. Not only is it part of the name of his successful rocket company, but one of his children; his AI start-up; and an internet banking firm he co-founded that became PayPal.

 Social media expert Beth Caroll, of Wunderman Thompson, is sceptical of Musk's apparent plans. ""There's a vague possibility he could have this bigger picture idea, this super app like a WeChat, and if he were to deliver that then he might have a viable product,"" she says. ""But for now he has just decimated the business."" Indeed, earlier this year the company was valued at less than a third of the $44bn Musk paid for it. Even the hiring of Linda Yaccarino, an experienced figure from NBCUniversal, as chief executive has done little to repair the monetary or reputational damage. It's worth remembering, Caroll says, that Musk did try awfully hard to back out of buying Twitter, and all the challenges he's faced are perhaps a sign of why. Can Musk really have it all? Yet despite it all, for its remaining users - whether enthusiastic or reluctant - X remains best at this particular type of social media, where real-time updates reign supreme.  For Dr Annmarie Hanlon, lecturer in digital and social marketing at Cranfield School of Management, would-be rivals from the ""clunky"" Mastodon to Meta's ""basic"" Threads have failed to offer a comparable experience. ""The everything app is still a work in progress,"" she says. ""But when Threads opened, everyone said 'this is the death of Twitter'. And it hasn't been."" Of course, given the contempt Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have for each other, don't expect the Meta boss to abandon his company's new app anytime soon. And when it comes to ""the death of Twitter"", Musk would happily claim responsibility, with X the phoenix rising from its ashes. But unlike the rockets of SpaceX (well, most of them), biographer Vlismas doubts how far it can fly.  ""With SpaceX, the grand vision is colonising Mars,"" he says. ""But the core purpose is launching rockets into space and it's very effective at that. ""If you wanted to do anything else with it, it dilutes that purpose. ""The longer X is a bit muddled like this, the worse it is. And the more people will turn away.""

Musk, the owner of Tesla, Space X and the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, reacted to a 45-second clip of Yousaf listing all the senior public posts in Scotland held by white people, which was posted on X by an anonymous account called End Wokeness. The account, which has a paid-for blue verification mark, accused Yousaf, who is Scotland’s first ethnic minority first minister, of “openly despising white people”. It said: “Why would Scotland’s parliament and King select a guy who hates almost 100% of the country?” Musk replied: “What a blatant racist!” What a blatant racist! Musk was quickly challenged on X, while Yousaf responded by posting a gif of an Asian shopkeeper from the BBC Scotland sitcom Still Game doing a shimmying dance in his shop with the words “racists foaming at the mouth at my very existence”. Racists foaming at the mouth at my very existence.Me: pic.twitter.com/DsKRWRhnIy Numerous posts pointed out that Yousaf had been arguing that Scotland’s public sector and institutions were not demonstrating a clear commitment to racial diversity given nearly every one was run by white people. The Ferret news website subjected the post, which reused a clip from an account called ChurchillsCigar, to its factchecking service and found it was false. It said the extract was a highly selective excerpt of a broader statement, a conclusion reposted by critics of Yousaf’s government. The excerpt of Yousaf’s statement has been repeatedly amplified in Scotland by far-right nativist groups who claim it was racist. Audience members and protesters have also accused him of racism at events. Yousaf has been widely praised for his handling of the Israel-Hamas crisis, hosting meetings with Jewish leaders and the widow of a Jewish man murdered by Hamas and issuing joint statements condemning the violence. His wife, Nadia El-Nakla, is half-Palestinian and his first wife was white. The clip was taken from May 2020 when Yousaf was speaking to MSPs on a motion in support of anti-racist activism after the death of George Floyd, where he discussed the racism he had experienced since being elected. “Some people have been surprised or taken aback by my mention on my social media that at 99% of the meetings that I go to, I am the only non-white person in the room,” he told the chamber. “Why are we so surprised when the most senior positions in Scotland are filled almost exclusively by people who are white?” He then listed all the senior judicial, policing and legal posts in his justice portfolio held by white people, and said the same could be found in health, another portfolio he held. “Almost every trade union in the country, headed by people who are white people,” he added. “In the Scottish government, every director general is white. Every chair of every public body is white. That is not good enough.” A spokesperson for Yousaf said on Friday: “The first minister has been on the receiving end of racist hate, abuse and death threats his entire life, and has stood firm against hatred and bigotry, of any kind, throughout. “Sadly, much of the racist abuse and threats of violence the first minister faces are directed his way on X. Mr Musk should use his position to tackle racism and hatred that goes unchecked on the social media platform he owns.”"

That statement has proven to be one of the few certainties about his ownership of the influential social media platform, which has tipped the business into a state of constant flux, with advertisers slashing spending, user numbers down, regulators circling and the staff at less than 50% of what it used to be. From dumping a world-renowned brand to attempting to overhaul the company’s business model, Musk has changed Twitter more in the past year than any other executive in the 16 years prior. Musk acquired Twitter on 27 October 2022. The biggest single change in a tumultuous 12 months was rebranding Twitter as X, a long-mooted move for an entrepreneur who has harboured ambitions to create an “everything app” that handles messaging, social networking, audio, video, payments and online shopping. Shortly before he completed the $44bn (£36bn) takeover, Musk signalled what was coming when he described the deal as an “accelerant to creating X, the everything app”. Nonetheless, the sudden dumping of the Twitter brand in July this year took the tech world by surprise. Compared with Facebook and Instagram’s multibillion-person combined user base, Twitter was a modest platform with 238 million daily users – but it was influential and well-known. According to X’s new chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, speaking at a conference last month, the social network now has between 200 million and 250 million users, although she indicated later during her appearance that the number is 225 million – which would indicate a decline. Visits to X dropped 10% on the prior month to 5.8bn in September, according to data firm Similarweb. Bruce Daisley, the former head of Twitter’s European operations, said the rebranding move had damaged a business that was in “brand heaven”. “There was plenty wrong with the product, but the brand was in the top tier of companies in the world,” he said. “Names as diverse as Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian, The Rock and Greta Thunberg would all use the name and help promote the platform. Musk destroyed all of that.” If the rebranding of Twitter signalled a shift in the company’s business model, there was a need for change anyway due to the pressure on its main revenue stream. Advertising accounted for nearly 90% of Twitter’s $5.1bn in annual revenue in 2021. That total has slumped due to an advertiser exodus triggered by fears over moderation standards on the platform and general concerns about Musk’s leadership. In a post last month, Musk said US advertising revenue had fallen 60%, a situation which he blamed on pressure from the Anti-Defamation League, which campaigns against antisemitism and bigotry. With quarterly debt payments of $300m and a fall in the main source of cash to pay it, the company needs to find money elsewhere – if it can. It is against this backdrop that Musk has sought to overhaul the platform’s subscription product, formerly known as Twitter Blue but now branded as X premium. The X rebrand has carried promises of turning the business into an “everything app” modelled on Tencent’s WeChat, dominant in China, that carries out a multitude of tasks from messaging to payments and food deliveries. But even before completing the takeover – a tortuous process in itself – Musk had signalled that he aimed to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising via a subscription drive, which he also hoped would reduce the number of automated accounts vexing the social network. To this end, he oversaw a botched relaunch of the Blue product in November, which resulted in a slew of impersonator accounts operated by pranksters who took up the offer of a verified account checkmark – and all the chaos that could cause if, for instance, you’re not really George W Bush – for $8 a month. Since then, the subscription service has relaunched again with perks, including the verified checkmark and greater prominence on the platform for your posts. According to one estimate from Travis Brown, a software developer who tracked Twitter Blue sign-ups, the number of subscriptions had reached more than 600,000 by April this year, or more than $5m a month in extra revenue which is not enough to cover a multibillion-dollar advertising slump. Last week Musk went a step further, following up on hints that he was going to charge to access the site by rolling out a $1 annual charge to new users in New Zealand and the Philippines. The policy was dubbed “Not a Bot” by X, following the logic that spammers won’t want to pay up for every troll account they launch. Musk also indicated that two new subscription tiers will be coming: one with “higher cost” that features no ads; and another “lower cost” option with all the extra features, but no reductions in ads. Bruce Daisley, the former head of Twitter’s European operations, says that trying to diversify away from advertising is “strategically a good call” but it has been badly handled. “With the changes he has made, not least bringing in paid verification, he has served to reduce the quality of the platform. When you include the capricious decision-making, advertisers have said: ‘We don’t want to be part of that.’” One of Musk’s first acts as owner of Twitter was firing approximately 50% of the platform’s 7,500 staff. Evan Hansen, then a director of curation at the platform, was among the thousands of people axed abruptly by an owner who had claimed before the takeover that the platform had a “very far-left” bias. “He believed that our team was biased … that the entire moderation team was actively promoting liberal conversations and being partial with conservative ones,” says Hansen, who had had a long career as a respected tech journalist before joining Twitter in 2016. Hansen says his team would “nourish a variety of viewpoints” via features such as Twitter Moments or ensure that readers “experienced perspectives that they would otherwise not encounter”. That service included demoting toxic trending subjects or putting a representative tweet in hashtag timelines to explain why certain subjects were trending. Referring to the social network now, Hansen says: “Our work is completely gone.” Musk has reinstated previously banned users such as Donald Trump and the misogynist influencer Andrew Tate, while also arbitrarily banning tech journalists who crossed his path. In September, Musk posted on his X account that he had disbanded X’s election integrity team ahead of more than 70 elections around the globe in the coming year. Musk and Yaccarino are pushing X’s crowd-sourced fact-checking feature, Community Notes, as a key element of its moderation systems. But doubts have been raised over its ability to cope with a deluge of misinformation related to the Israel-Hamas war. The social network’s approach to content moderation, and general concerns about Musk’s leadership, have hurt the business by warding off advertisers. Farhad Divecha, owner and managing director of the London-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, says X’s standing among advertisers has plummeted. Since that initial wave of firings, X’s workforce was reduced further to about 1,500, Musk said in April. “The past 12 months have seen Twitter go from a solid third or fourth option – after Google, Meta and occasionally LinkedIn – for digital advertising to the bottom of the pile,” he said. “Changes to brand safety, opening up the network to extremists under the guise of free speech, requiring advertisers to pay for verification, and firing a lot of the staff have sent signals that the platform doesn’t care about brand safety or advertisers.” X’s handling of hateful or misleading content has come under further scrutiny in the wake of the Hamas attack on Israel. Thierry Breton, the EU commissioner responsible for the bloc’s Digital Services Act, has written to Musk alleging that the platform is “being used to disseminate illegal content and disinformation in the EU”. Meta (the owner of Facebook and Instagram) and TikTok have also been warned about Israel-Hamas coverage on their platforms, but X’s issues threaten to compound its problems with advertisers. Musk fired Twitter’s chief executive, Parag Agrawal, as soon as the billionaire completed the deal and took over running the platform. Tumult ensued. In a nod to the damage done to the cornerstone of X’s business model, in May Musk appointed a renowned advertising industry executive as CEO. Yaccarino, then head of global advertising at media and entertainment conglomerate NBCUniversal, is highly respected within her field. She has moved to repair the company’s relationship with advertisers by reinstating a “client council” for marketing and ad agency executives but admitted she has found the job hard. “It’s hard. It’s hard on me. It’s hard on my family, my children, my parents,” she told the Financial Times. Yaccarino told a conference in September that X would be profitable next year (the platform is historically loss-making), that engagement from users was up “dramatically” and that advertisers were coming back, despite indicating that daily users numbers had dropped to around 225 million. Banks expect to take a $2bn hit, according to The Wall Street Journal. Musk remains heavily involved in running X, with an executive role focused on product design, new technology and tweeting a lot. Yaccarino needs to ensure that advertisers are around to fund Musk’s planned transformation. She also has regulatory pressures to deal with. The US Department of Justice is investigating whether the “chaotic environment” at the platform under Musk violated a government order requiring an overhaul of its data security and privacy practices, while the US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the Tesla CEO’s actions ahead of the deal. “It’s a new day at X,” Yaccarino said in September. Some users, advertisers and former employees, however, are nostalgic for the old days."

			EV makers are increasingly competing on price as the market becomes more crowded
		 Tesla has cut the price of its entry-level Model 3 car in Britain in the latest effort to boost demand for its electric vehicles amid growing competition and sluggish sales. The car maker began selling a new version of the Model 3 on Tuesday for £39,990, £3,000 cheaper than the previous cheapest version.  Tesla has repeatedly cut prices in the US this year and reduced UK prices in January as it faces a sales war with incumbent manufacturers and a generation of Chinese car makers. Electric car companies have also faced questions over demand after Rishi Sunak recently delayed a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Tesla recently overhauled its Model 3 line, increasing the car’s range and changing its design, along with controversial tweaks such as removing the indicator stalks in favour of putting the controls on the steering wheel. The new design is reportedly cheaper to produce, allowing the company to cut prices without sacrificing profit margins. Tesla has kept the price of its family-sized Model Y the same at £44,990. The vehicle was Britain’s best-selling electric car last year, and the best-selling model of any car in June this year. Earlier this month Tesla revealed disappointing sales for the third quarter of the year, posting a quarterly decline in sales. The company delivered 435,059 cars in the period, down from 466,140 in the previous three months. Mr Musk is due to reveal how the sales drop has affected Tesla’s financials on Wednesday evening, when the company unveils quarterly results. He has suggested he could keep cutting prices during “turbulent times” for the electric car market. In the US, Tesla recently cut the price of its Model 3 and Model Y close to record lows amid growing competition. Sales in the US have been boosted by substantial subsidies on electric car purchases. Tesla released its updated Model 3 in the US and Europe last month but the new vehicle will not be delivered to customers in the UK until early next year due to production delays related to the driver sitting on the right-hand side of the vehicle. Tesla has stopped manufacturing its high-end Model S and X with the right-hand side configuration."

In the 365 days since the South African-born billionaire took over one of the most influential social media platforms globally, he’s spent the time “remoulding” the site into his image. Doing away with the vast majority of the 8,000 employees he inherited, Musk embarked on a bizarre and public attempt to cut costs, after a legal battle led to him paying $44billion for the site. Whilst seeing the businessman as an “incredibly talented and brilliant man”, ex-employees were left shocked at how he conducted himself. One compared him to a juvenile with his “immature” sense of humour, but others claimed the billionaire could be “very intentionally cruel”. The Mirror has spoken to ex-employees of the site, and media experts to reflect on Elon Musk’s very public takeover of Twitter, now known as X, and the year of chaos and change that followed.  The takeover began nine months before it was eventually finalised. In January 2022, Elon Musk began buying up Twitter stock. Manu Cornet, a software engineer who joined Twitter in 2021 after 15 years at Google, described this as “the first ominous signs”. In of itself, there is nothing unusual with a billionaire “sloshing” their money around. But a few months later outgoing CEO and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey described Elon Musk as the “singular solution” - something he would later admit was a mistake. In April of that year, Musk was invited to become a board member, and initially agreed to purchase the company - but what followed was intense legal wrangling as the billionaire tried to seemingly pull out of the deal over concerns about bots on the site, and Twitter tried to make him follow through with it. Over the coming months, Melissa Ingle, a former content moderator at Twitter who specialised in political disinformation, described the “uncertainty” that filled the company from spring through to Autumn. Speaking to The Mirror about the one year anniversary of Musk's takeover, she said: “We'd just experienced a change in leadership from Jack Dorsey, one of the founders, to Parag Agrawal, and the entire time was surreal. “Throughout this six month period, we were also countersuing him so that he would have to pay $1bn if he backed out of the deal, per the conditions of the purchase. We were simultaneously suing him and leadership was pretending everything was fine. We would have regular company meetings and they acted like it was no big deal.” Acting like it was “no big deal” was something Manu echoed as well, as the company seemed to downplay any change in its future - oblivious that it was soon to undergo some of the rockiest times of its short life. Meanwhile, Twitter and Musk sued and countersued one another, throughout the summer.  Everything took a turn in October, when media reports began to emerge claiming Musk was planning to let go 75 per cent of Twitter’s staff. Employing around 8,000 people, Twitter had a far smaller headcount than its rivals in Meta (Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp) and TikTok. “Twitter was about 1/10 the size of Facebook or Instagram and much smaller than TikTok, but it seemed like every journalist and politician was on it. It had a huge influence,” Melissa told The Mirror. It was this influence that made the site so powerful, and attracted it to the likes of Musk, who eventually reportedly had his engineers make a special system so his voice was the loudest in the world’s largest chatroom. During this time, the deal seemed to be edging ever closer, but employees were left in limbo. Manu described it as a “weightlessness” as they set targets and made plans for the next year, not knowing how if they would be there. For the likes of Melissa, Musk had long voiced his opposition to how Twitter moderated content on the platform, walking the seemingly-impossible tightrope of allowing freedom of speech and preventing it spilling into hate. Melissa said: “He [Musk] had already spoken openly about his dislike of our content moderation policies and we all felt like we had targets on our backs … we were very worried that entire time about the future of our jobs.” During this time, in the final run up to when Musk would formally take over Twitter, he dialled into a company-wide call - but left current Tweeps (Twitter staff) apparently less than impressed. He was described, alternatingly, as “dishevelled” and “disinterested”. Manu said it looked like his personal chef was working in the background throughout the call. Then came the fateful day, one year ago today, Elon Musk concluded the controversial and chaotic process to buy Twitter - and would go on to run the company the same way. A lot was said about the process to buy Twitter, and how willingly along with it Musk went. But in the end, he had control of one of the globe’s most powerful and influential social media platforms. Leading politicians made game changing announcements on the platform, journalists broke the latest stories, scientists shared their findings, and people connected across the world. Amidst the seriousness of the situation, and the concern and “panic” inside Twitter for some employees, the very next day, Elon Musk turned up at Twitter with a sink - for a joke. He tweeted: Employees had mixed impressions and feelings about the takeover. Generally, many people saw Musk as being a very good businessman, but there were concerns about his suitability to run a platform like Twitter, which required more than just being a good engineer, but a delicate understanding of the balances between free speech and hate, and how to entertain, and keep safe, a global community. Melissa admitted she’s “never seen anything like it”, referring to his takeover, but some employees the Mirror spoke to tried to remain optimistic. Manu met Musk on that fateful day, and even handed over a cartoon he’d drawn, poking fun at the new Twitter boss. But the meeting was “anticlimactic” with Musk coming across as “socially awkward”. He said: “It was really anticlimactic, it didn’t really change my views in anyway, he was really similar to how he is in videos, or interviews, he was a little bit socially awkward, he was hard to read, the way he responded in the line to the cartoon it felt like maybe he was forced to buy Twitter,”. The cartoon he gave to Musk read: “You break it, you buy it!” and Musk told Manu: “Well I bought it anyway”. Some Twitter employees feared the worst, whilst others tried to remain optimistic. Manu described how Musk issued “mandates” that led to people working late into the evenings, and weekends. Manu even slept overnight at the office - something he wasn’t alone in doing. However, what followed - and the manner in which it was done - lost sympathy left with many employees, and irreparably changed the company forever. Staff were informed that the next morning they would receive an email, this would either be into their work email, in which case they had a job, or their personal email, in which case they were fired. The worst of the rumours about the mass-redundancies were true, and Musk was set to cull most of the company. At the time, a number of tech companies were undergoing similar lay-offs due to contractions, and past bloated, over-hiring practices. But none executed them quite like Musk did. It wasn’t quite clear, internally, or externally, if there was any reason behind the firings. Manu said they appeared random, following a widely reported “code review”. He saw his team’s most productive engineer “by a long run” let go. As for Melissa, working in battling political disinformation, half of her department were let go, even though the US midterms, at this point, were just four days away. Melissa survived the first round of lay-offs, but Manu wasn’t so lucky. Mid-meeting he described being locked out of his computer and email, and began worrying he had been hacked. It was only when he opened up his email that he realised what had happened. He’d received a message informing him his time at Twitter was up. He’d been let go. Melissa said she “survived” until ten days later, on November 12, when out shopping with her 12-year-old daughter and her friend, she received a message saying “one of more of your access tokens has been removed”. She immediately knew she’d been fired, even though no one told her. But worse was to follow.  Melissa said: “I felt awful, I was terrified about how I would survive. I'm a single parent living in one of the most expensive cities in the world and I already work two jobs (I also teach data science at night). I wasn't sure I'd be able to keep living in my home, let alone afford a nice Christmas for my kids."" Alongside that, Melissa began experiencing a deluge of hate after she spoke out to media. People attacked her ""relentlessly"" even leading to ""detailed death threats"". She added: ""One person told me how and where he would murder me. It was very scary.” In successive rounds of lay-offs, Manu said 85 per cent of Twitter’s 8,000 staff were let go. This included entire teams, such as the content moderation team, communications team, and more. Such was the chaos of the lay-offs, that some people were quickly brought back on board after it emerged they were key in keeping vital aspects of the site running. Manu added: “I do like that he brought the sink, but the next day when he fired thousands of people it’s not quite as funny anymore”. The year since has been “disastrous” Professor Shakuntala Banaji, a professor of media and culture at LSE told the Mirror. From the impacts of firing most of your staff, to the “flight of advertisers” leaving the site, taking their money with them, and Twitter seeing an alleged rise in hate speech and trolling. One study found that hate speech increased overall, and especially in users who had been hateful before. The Center for Countering Digital Hate published a number of reports detailing an increase in anti-LGBTQ hate speech and climate misinformation - and Musk would later threaten to sue them. Further studies showed a rise in Anti-Semitic hate, and slurs, and a BBC analysis of reinstated accounts found a third appeared to violate Twitter's guidelines. The former employees The Mirror spoke to said they could only watch as the site they had given so much to build up, became something they found unrecognisable. Professor Banaji, whose work touches on disinformation, misinformation and fake news, democracy, the internet, social media and civic participation, said: “This is reflected in advertising flight. Major companies have withdrawn their revenue in response to increased vulnerability and the unprecedented rise of hate speech.” Those left at Twitter are alternatively passionate Musk fans. In his year in charge, Musk has rushed through a swathe of changes to the site. He’s torn up and remade the verification system, letting anyone pay for a blue badge, and vastly changed who is shown on people’s timelines. Melissa said: “Musk has really remoulded Twitter in his own image. He's removed most content moderation rules. Hate speech is no longer a reason for a suspension or ban. To me, the site just ""feels"" bad … I used to love watching breaking news come in or election night returns. Now, I just don't trust it at all.” Manu echoed this as well, highlighting the rise in disinformation and “fake stuff”. He also touched on the strange change of name, calling Twitter ‘X’ instead. Professor Banaji argued that the site was “consistently less safe now than it was a year ago” and raised concerns, echoed elsewhere, about the impact Twitter’s changing policies would have on democracies - given social media’s outsized influence on voter habits and turnouts. In terms of numbers, the data crunched by GWS Magnify, shared with the Mirror, showed that Twitter’s active daily users is down 16 per cent from since the app rebranded as X. Despite this, the average time a user engages with the platform actually went up 7 per cent. Amidst the chaos, a number of rival platforms have emerged including Meta-run Threads - but none of them have come close to dethroning Musk’s Twitter, which, as Manu pointed out, despite losing most of its staff, overhauling its policies, and having a very public and chaotic takeover, is still running, and still used by millions every day.

October 27 marks the first anniversary of the billionaire’s 44 billion dollar (£36 billion) takeover of the social media giant. Since then, Mr Musk has laid off more than half the company’s staff and changed its name, as well as been embroiled in a string of controversies over content moderation, his belief in absolute free speech and the reinstating of accounts which had been banned for breaching site rules on hate speech. What the average person wants when they read something on their screen is to understand whether it's fact or fiction, and at the moment Twitter is not the place for anybody to figure that out The platform has also been dogged by outage and performance issues and come under scrutiny from regulators around the world over its work to stop the spread of harmful content. When asked about Mr Musk’s year at the firm, social media commentator Drew Benvie, founder and chief executive of communications agency Battenhall, said he “couldn’t imagine it going any worse”. He said that although there had already been a shift in how people were using social media because of the rise of misinformation in recent years, Mr Musk’s changes to X since his takeover had “made it worse”. In particular, he highlighted the decision to change the site’s verification system so that rather than the platform awarding verified status to accounts who could prove their authenticity, it can now be purchased by anyone who pays for it. “What used to happen in organised disinformation would be for them to create, through software, thousands if not hundreds of thousands of accounts which promote one another and look real – now Mr Musk has made that worse, when he thought he was making it better,” Mr Benvie told the PA news agency. “He allowed you to buy the verification badge rather than be awarded it. “What the average person wants when they read something on their screen is to understand whether it’s fact or fiction, and at the moment Twitter is not the place for anybody to figure that out.” According to figures from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), hate speech has surged on the platform since Mr Musk’s takeover. Research from the group published in September showed that 86% of 300 hateful posts reported to X moderators were still online a week after they were flagged, despite some containing what the CCDH called content “glorifying antisemitism, anti-Black racism, neo-Nazism, white supremacy and other racism”. Mr Benvie said that in terms of both personal and brand safety on the platform, Mr Musk had “an awful lot to answer for”. He also warned that with new social media regulation coming into force around the world, it would not be impossible to foresee a scenario where X gets caught up in a “cycle of fines” before “shutting down”. Fellow social media expert, Matt Navarra, described Mr Musk’s year at the site as “chaotic, expensive and hugely damaging”. He told PA that Mr Musk’s decision-making had “decimated” the company’s brand and reputation, and badly damaged public trust in the site as a place to “get news” or even just be “relied upon”. It's not going to be the X, or Twitter, that people want or know. That bird is dead He also warned that the site’s worsening relationship with advertisers would pose problems for the company down the line as it is now reliant on finding other revenue streams in order to pay off debts. Mr Navarra said he did not think X would “disappear” but warned that its user base could become more extreme. “I think it will be a pretty unpleasant place to be for a mainstream audience,” he said. “I think that it’s going to be more of the same in the next 12 months – we can expect more people to migrate out of there, but we might see a levelling off of the decline in terms of users, because I think a different type of community and user will be attracted to the platform. “I think that will drive the mainstream out and bring the extreme in. “I don’t think that’s a particularly healthy, sustainable future for X, and certainly, it’s not going to be the X, or Twitter, that people want or know. That bird is dead.” PA Wire Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later? Start your Independent Premium subscription today.

""One is lower cost with all features, but no reduction in ads, and the other is more expensive, but has no ads,"" the billionaire said in a post on X. It comes as the firm started charging new users $1 in New Zealand and the Philippines for accessing the platform. Mr Musk did not provide more details on the plans. New users who opt out of subscribing will only be able to take ""read only"" actions, such as reading posts, watching videos, and following accounts, the company said in its website. It is not clear if there will be any free options. Mr Musk has long said that his solution for getting rid of bots and fake accounts on the social media platform is charging for the service.  Since taking over the firm in October last year he has looked to incentivise users to pay for an enhanced service, which is now called X Premium. Some users now opt to pay $8 per month for the blue check subscription service. Its ""Not A Bot"" subscription method aims to reduce spam, manipulation of the platform and bot activity. He has also tried to woo advertisers back to X with offers of discounts. Mr Musk's rapid changes, including mass layoffs and disbanding content moderation teams, has led to advertisers halting ads on the service. He acknowledged that the platform has taken a hit on revenue and blamed activists for pressuring advertisers. Other big tech companies have also experimented with a mix of ad-supported and subscription plans.  While Alphabet's YouTube has both paid and free, ad-supported ones, Netflix's ad-supported plans are also chargeable, though at a lower price. YouTube, which like X is populated by content from users, shares a part of its subscription revenue with creators. X, which also shares some of its ad revenue with content creators, did not disclose if content creators will be paid in ad-free subscription models. Despite Mr Musk's attempts to generate revenue on X, as the company faced criticism over lax content moderation, advertisers have not come flooding back over concerns their ads might appear next to inappropriate content. Last week, the European Commission launched an investigation into X to see whether it complies with new tech rules on illegal and harmful content following the spread of disinformation on its platform after Hamas's attack on Israel.

			Bastion of online free speech struggles to contain disinformation amid severe staff cuts
		 Twitter has been flooded with online fake news and disinformation about the conflict between Israel and Hamas as the policies put in place by owner Elon Musk buckle under their first major test. Twitter, now rebranded as X, has been deluged with doctored videos and bot accounts since Hamas’s massacre of hundreds of Israelis on Oct 7. The platform, which Musk has tried to re-forge as a bastion of online free speech, has struggled to contain the situation after its billionaire owner cut thousands of staff and rolled back previous moderation policies. Musk was warned by European Union officials that his site was being used to “disseminate illegal content and disinformation”. Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal market tsar, wrote to Musk demanding a response within 24 hours on the social network’s response to false information. “I remind you that following the opening of a potential investigation and a finding of non-compliance, penalties can be imposed,” Breton said.On Wednesday, Michelle Donelan, the Technology Secretary, met with Meta, Google, Twitter, Snapchat and TikTok, demanding the technology companies step up efforts to take down posts glorifying Hamas and protect children from violent images. She said Hamas supporters had been able to “spread their monstrous content with people around the world” which “haunts us all, not least our children”. She added tech companies “can and must do more to stop supporters of Hamas pushing wicked terrorism and antisemitism to the world”. She ordered the companies to write to her with their plans. All of the major social networks have been racing to take down posts that break their rules around spreading disinformation. But Twitter’s response has come in for particular scrutiny following Musk’s sweeping changes to how the site handles false claims. Since buying the business a year ago, Musk has slashed the size of the company’s moderation team and resorted instead to asking Twitter users to verify information on the site through a process known as Community Notes. Responding to the EU’s Breton on Twitter, Musk said: “Our policy is that everything is open source and transparent, an approach that I know the EU supports.” But the limits of this system are plain to see. On Twitter, it is not hard to find obviously false videos. Among widely shared posts are videos of old conflicts or footage from video games. One video, from the game Arma 3, showed helicopters being shot down, which several accounts claimed were Israeli losses. The video was viewed 230,000 times. This video, viewed 230,000 times, is not footage of a Hamas militant shooting down an Israeli helicopter. It's from the video game Arma 3. pic.twitter.com/bj8h7zbGKb While large numbers of posts have been flagged as misleading, these user generated warnings are failing to stem the flow of misinformation. In many cases, copies of the same fake videos spread widely on other accounts without a label. Twitter has started paying accounts that get more views on their posts, creating an incentive to share claims that will garner more attention. Meanwhile, Musk’s new system of user verification provides accounts with a “blue tick” if they pay a monthly subscription. It means any user can add to their authority if they have the money. The system was previously limited to high profile users, news sources and journalists. On Saturday, a fake document that purported to show an order from the White House to send $8bn (£6.5bn) in aid to Israel was spread rapidly by “blue tick” accounts. Professor Sander van der Linden, director of Cambridge University’s Social Decision-Making Lab, says Twitter’s crowd-sourced community notes feature is “no match for the deluge of disinformation they are facing”. He claims cutbacks have meant the platform has “reduced their capabilities under the banner of ‘unmoderated free speech’.” Musk has reduced Twitter’s headcount by over 80pc since his takeover last November. In a post on Twitter, the company’s safety team said it had “actioned tens of thousands of posts” and “taken action to remove several hundred accounts attempting to manipulate trending topics”. In the past couple of days, we’ve seen an increase in daily active users on @X in the conflict area, plus there have been more than 50 million posts globally focusing on the weekend’s terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas.As the events continue to unfold rapidly, a cross-company… The challenge of fake news is not unique to Twitter. On TikTok, videos falsely purporting to show a massive landing of Hamas paratroopers were widely available with a quick search. Some were first posted over a week before Saturday’s first attacks and showed an event in Egypt. TikTok added a label to the video, which unhelpfully simply states: “The actions in this video are performed by professionals.” After The Telegraph flagged one such video, it was removed. While many false claims are spread unintentionally, there are concerns that efforts to amplify fake news may be coordinated by bad actors. Rafi Mendelsohn, of Israeli social media monitoring company Cyabra, believes as many as a fifth of accounts that are commenting, liking or sharing posts about the conflict may be fake across all social media. Some accounts have sat dormant for years, before posting thousands of times about the conflict in a matter of days. Speaking from his home in Israel, where rocket fire can be heard in the distance, Mendelsohn says: “The scale of what we are seeing is akin to a state actor influence operations campaign.” While such manipulation can be sophisticated, fake accounts are a known problem that social media companies have struggled to get a grip on. Cyabra previously helped Musk analyse the level of fake accounts on Twitter prior to his takeover. But Mendelsohn notes: “The level of fake profiles on Twitter is much the same as it was previously.” Musk’s personal judgement on fake news has also been questioned. The billionaire told users to follow two anonymous accounts that have been later accused of spreading misinformation and in one case, anti-Semetic material. He later deleted the tweet. A German government organisation set up to tackle hate speech on Wednesday said it would quit Musk’s app in protest over what it said was a rise in discriminatory posts. The Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency said: “In our opinion, X is no longer an acceptable environment.” Musk risks a clash with the EU if he fails to get a grip on the problem under sweeping new tech laws introduced by the bloc. Britain will soon have new Online Safety Laws that can impose fines for harmful content too. Damian Collins, the Conservative MP and former Digital Minister, says social networks can be punished if they fail to take down illegal disinformation, such as state-sponsored fake news networks. He says: “Ofcom will have regulatory powers to take actions against them and levy large fines.” Failure to stop illegal disinformation that is likely to incite violence or glorify terror can also lead to fines once the laws come into force. A government spokesman said the Online Safety Bill “will force all companies in scope to take down any illegal misinformation and disinformation if they become aware of it on their services”. They said: “The largest online platforms will also be legally required to remove misinformation and disinformation if it is prohibited in their terms of service.” Amid the confusion, Musk has simply resorted to urging his followers to try to stick to verified information. “As always, please try [to] stay as close to the truth as possible,” he said on Saturday. For many users, it is harder than ever to get a sense of reality when scrolling on Twitter. Eliot Higgins, founder of the investigative news site Bellingcat, said in a post on the social network: “Musk has created a fundamental issue with Twitter’s credibility in moments of crisis.”"

And Benjamin Netanyahu just dropped in to see him. A parade of foreign leaders on recent US trips, including on official state visits at the White House's invitation, have added sit-downs with Elon Musk to their schedules. This year, the world's richest man has met with, to name a few, the heads of France, Italy, India, South Korea - and, in just the past two days, Turkey and Israel. Yet while the mercurial billionaire is more highly sought after than ever, there is no love lost between him and the Biden administration. And as the outspoken contrarian's political reach expands, including by wading into sensitive geopolitical issues, there is growing unease for some over Mr Musk's power and access.   Some foreign leaders are seeking an economic and electric vehicle industry boost from a new Tesla factory or an infrastructure investment from SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet services. Others have discussed X, the Musk-owned platform formerly known as Twitter, and the future of artificial intelligence. French President Macron has courted the tech mogul three times since December, a charm offensive driven by the desire for a new Tesla gigafactory in his country. Similar entreaties have come from Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in June and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan this past Sunday in New York. And though Mr Musk had just been in New York ahead of this week's United Nations General Assembly, Israeli PM Netanyahu flew to California for an AI conversation with him on Monday. The latter discussion took place against the backdrop of Mr Musk's simmering feud with the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish civil rights organisation. The ADL and other groups have released findings that suggest hate speech has grown dramatically on X since he bought the site last year and changed its moderation rules. Mr Netanyahu - who has previously tweeted admiration for Mr Musk's ""genius & impact on humanity"" - encouraged him in their live-streamed conversation on Monday to ""find the balance"" between protecting free speech and punishing hate speech. It was not the first time he has had to answer for concerns with X since he took over. His sit-down with Indian PM Modi in June came on the heels of ex-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's allegation that the Indian government had threatened to shut down the site if it did not comply with orders to take down content. Those in the pre-Musk era of the company had largely pushed back against such demands, but Mr Musk said he could not do so. ""If we don't obey local government laws, we will get shut down so the best we can do is to hew close to the law in any given country, but it is impossible for us to do more than that or we'll be blocked and our people will be arrested,"" he told reporters after the Modi meeting. While many of these meetings have ostensibly focused on Mr Musk's significant business interests, they come as he wields - and increasingly asserts - influence over global geopolitics. Recent statements from the South African-born US citizen have been interpreted in some corners as an affront to US interests, as well as those of the broader global West. Last week, he left Taiwanese officials fuming with apparently offhand comments on Beijing's 'One-China' policy, suggesting the self-governed island is ""analogous to like Hawaii or something like that, an integral part of China that is arbitrarily not part of China"". Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu shot back on X: ""Listen up, Taiwan is not part of the PRC & certainly not for sale!"" The spat gave fuel to claims by Musk critics that he is quick to acquiesce to the demands of other countries, even when they are US adversaries. ""Hope Elon Musk can also ask the CCP to open X to its people,"" Mr Wu wrote. ""Perhaps he thinks banning it is a good policy, like turning off Starlink to thwart Ukraine's counterstrike against Russia."" The Starlink claim - that the entrepreneur ""secretly told his engineers to turn off coverage"" to prevent a Ukrainian sneak attack on the Russian naval fleet in Crimea - concerned US allies. But amid strong pushback from Mr Musk, author Walter Isaacson began walking back the claim as his book was hitting shelves, writing on X that Starlink coverage up to Crimea was never in fact enabled. Neither Mr Isaacson nor Mr Musk responded to requests for comment from the BBC. The Isaacson book, however, claims elsewhere that, before Mr Musk made his decision, Russia's ambassador to the US ""explicitly told him that a Ukrainian attack on Crimea would lead to a nuclear response"". And after he tweeted out a peace proposal last year that led one Ukrainian official to question whether he had ""been hacked by Russians"", political scientist Ian Bremmer dropped a bombshell on X. ""elon musk told me he had spoken with putin and the kremlin directly about ukraine. he also told me what the kremlin's red lines were,"" he wrote. Mr Musk denied the allegation, but Mr Bremmer doubled down: ""i've long admired musk as a unique and world-changing entrepreneur, which i've said publicly. he's not a geopolitics expert."" The next month, when asked if Mr Musk was a threat to US national security, President Biden replied that his ""cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at"". That is the tip of the iceberg in a frosty relationship - the White House tends to avoid mention of Tesla in its public comments on the electric vehicle industry, talking instead about unionised car-makers, while Mr Musk tangles online with top Democrats, says he can ""no longer support"" the party and flirts with Republican presidential challengers. Ashlee Vance, a Musk biographer who has covered him for more than a decade, argues that Mr Musk has been feeling frustrated and under-appreciated. ""This is a guy who likes to get a lot of [expletive] done, he thinks he's right, and he never likes things getting in his way,"" Mr Vance told the BBC. ""He was already this material wildcard, [the Biden administration] poured gasoline on the fire and they now have zero goodwill with which to try to rein him in."" The runaway success of Tesla and SpaceX have helped transform Mr Musk from genius innovator to celebrity icon. ""In the span of about 25 years, you could argue he has accomplished more than any other human being,"" said Mr Vance. ""He stands out in history of doing this across different industries on an unparalleled scale."" This video can not be played Watch: Musk takes son to meet Turkish President Erdogan But Mr Musk's growing wealth and political evolution over the past few years has also dovetailed with a more divisive and polarising public image, driven in part by his always-online, troll-happy persona on X. ""He's always been this guy who was very sure of his opinions on things and not afraid to express them,"" Mr Vance said. ""He used to play both sides to benefit his companies. He was pretty methodical, didn't talk about politics too much and, anytime he was talking about politics, it was around an issue like climate change."" Since 2017 or 2018, however, the billionaire has begun to caricature his public persona, he says. ""He says whatever comes to his mind. He's alienating people for no reason. He's sort of undermining himself at a time when his companies are actually doing really well."" ""In person, he's actually not the Twitter character at all,"" Mr Vance continued. ""Over time, he's become more sociable, he's extremely rational and interesting, and he's a very different person.""  Noam Cohen, a former New York Times tech columnist and author of The Know-It-Alls: The Rise of Silicon Valley as a Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ball, takes a slightly different view. He believes that Mr Musk's singular ambition and vision have made him an over-achiever in business as well as a ""quasi-governmental"" force. In his telling, Mr Musk has combined ""the physical"" - large factories, lots of employees and valuable products - with ""the digital"" - control over how information spreads. And no other tech titan, whether like Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos, has matched that, according to Mr Cohen. This video can not be played Watch: 'Overwhelming consensus' to regulate AI, says Elon Musk ""If he didn't buy Twitter, would we be talking about him? If he was just a multinational corporation, it would be normal that, if he wants factories in China, he meets with China."" And yet, he adds, Mr Musk has fallen into many of the same pitfalls as his Silicon Valley peers. ""They basically see the world the same way: you're out for yourself, there's no social safety net, you've got to work hard and the best rise to the top,"" Mr Cohen said. ""It's a combination of greed, and a basic mindset that sees intelligence as being the most important factor and the smartest people should run the world."" Mr Cohen says the fact that Mr Musk and other unelected moguls can make unilateral decisions with significant geopolitical consequences is a warning about wealth concentration and waning democracy. ""Is it acceptable for him to be in a position where he can decide whether the satellites go on or not? Is it acceptable for him to lay the public square?"" he asked. ""Just because you're good at programming or business, why would that mean you're good at making rules for how the world should work?""

Starship, as it's known, will be a fully reusable transport system capable of carrying up to 100 people to the Red ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-55564448,"This video can not be played Watch the moment Starship's launch was halted Elon Musk is developing a vehicle that could be a game-changer for space travel. Starship, as it's known, will be a fully reusable transport system capable of carrying up to 100 people to the Red Planet. Mr Musk's private spaceflight company SpaceX tried to get Starship airborne on Monday, April 17 but postponed the launch because of a pressurisation issue.  SpaceX could try to launch again later this week. This article takes an in-depth look at the project. The founding ethos of SpaceX was to make life multi-planetary. He says that settling humans on other worlds, such as Mars, could preserve civilisation if Earth were to experience a cataclysm, such as a large asteroid impact.   ""History is going to bifurcate along two directions. One path is we stay on Earth forever, and then there will be some eventual extinction event,"" Musk said in 2016. ""The alternative is to become a spacefaring civilisation and a multi-planet species, which I hope you would agree is the right way to go."" The SpaceX founder has often spoken about his dream of building cities on Mars. He believes that settlements would need large numbers of people in order to become self-sustaining. Realising this dream requires a vehicle that's up to the task. Starship is a rocket and spacecraft combination that could ferry more than 100 people a time to the Red Planet. The system is designed to be fully and rapidly reusable. Being fully reusable means the principal hardware elements are not discarded in the sea or allowed to burn up, as happens with some other launch systems, but return to the ground so they can be flown again.  Rapid reusability means that after coming back from space, Starship can be re-filled with propellant and be ready to launch again in a short period of time - like an aircraft. This reduces the cost of the whole enterprise. At launch, the spacecraft, called Starship, will sit atop a rocket called Super Heavy. The combined system will stand 120m (394ft) -tall and is also referred to as Starship. Let's take the spacecraft first. With its nosecone and landing fins, the stainless-steel vehicle resembles the rocket-ships from the golden age of science fiction.  At the rear of the 50m (160ft) -long craft are six highly efficient Raptor engines, developed over the course of a decade by SpaceX. The combustion takes place in stages, and the engine's design cuts the amount of propellant that's wasted. Towards the middle of the vehicle are the propellant tanks. These feed liquid methane (CH4) and liquid oxygen (O2) to the Raptors. Methane is the fuel and oxygen acts as an oxidiser - a chemical that makes the fuel burn. The combination is dubbed methalox.  The choice of fuel is unusual for rocket engines, but methane can generate plenty of thrust. It's also a prudent choice in light of Musk's designs on Mars. The SpaceX founder says that CH4 could be synthesised from Martian subsurface water and from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), using a chemical process known as the Sabatier reaction. Re-fuelling Starship for the return trip to Earth using Martian resources would confer a level of self-sufficiency, making journeys both more feasible and cost-effective. Towards the front of the spacecraft - which is sometimes referred to as the upper stage - is a huge payload compartment that will be able to haul large cargo or people to destinations in deep space. Now, let's turn to the rocket. Measuring 70m (230ft) -long, Super Heavy will be filled with cryogenic (chilled) methalox. It will be powered by around 33 Raptor engines (this specification has changed several times) and should achieve more than 70 Meganewtons (16 million lbs) of maximum thrust. It should be able to lift at least 100 tonnes of payload, and possibly as much as 150 tonnes, to low-Earth orbit. This will make Super Heavy more powerful than the immense Saturn V launcher used for the Apollo Moon missions in the 1960s and 70s. As it ascends from the launch pad, the combined Starship system will begin to pitch over towards the intended orbit.  When the upper stage separates in space, Super Heavy flips over while falling back towards Earth.  Steel structures called ""grid fins"" attached to the sides of the booster, will help steer the rocket stage back towards its launch pad so it can be flown again. SpaceX has an ambitious plan to then catch the falling booster using its launch tower. This tower provides engineers and crew members with access to the spacecraft and rocket while they are sitting on the pad before launch.  A pair of steel arms will extend out from the launch tower. The spent booster falls onto these arms. The tower has been dubbed ""Mechazilla"" because of its resemblance to a creature from the Godzilla movies. Meanwhile, the Starship upper stage could be inserted into a ""parking orbit"" after separation, allowing it to be re-filled with propellant. ""If you just fly [Starship] to orbit and don't do any refilling, it's pretty good â you'll get 150 tonnes to low-Earth orbit, and have no fuel to go anywhere else,"" Musk explained in 2017. ""If you send up tankers and re-fill in orbit, you could re-fill the tanks up all the way to the top, and get 150 tonnes [of payload] all the way to Mars."" To re-fuel, the spacecraft would dock with another Starship - already circling the Earth - that acts solely as a propellant depot. For long-haul trips to Mars and back - which could take up to nine months each way - Musk is looking to install around 40 cabins in the payload area near the front of the upper stage. ""You could conceivably have five or six people per cabin, if you really wanted to crowd people in. But I think mostly we would expect to see two or three people per cabin, and so nominally about 100 people per flight to Mars,"" Musk said. The payload bay would also host common areas, storage space, a galley and a shelter where people could gather to shield from solar storms, where the Sun belches out harmful charged particles into space. Starship will also play a key role in Nasa's Artemis programme, which aims to establish a long-term human presence on the Moon. In April 2021, the US space agency awarded SpaceX with a $2.89bn contract to develop Starship into a lander capable of delivering astronauts to the lunar surface this decade. The version tailored for Artemis flights would not possess the heat shield or flaps that are necessary for a return journey to Earth. Instead, the Starship Human Landing System would remain in space after its initial launch from Earth, so that it could eventually be used for multiple trips between lunar orbit and the Moon's surface. The uncrewed, or cargo, version of Starship features a payload bay that opens up like the mouth of a crocodile. This would allow it to be used for launching satellites. SpaceX says the huge payload capacity opens up possibilities for new types of robotic science mission, including telescopes larger than the James Webb observatory - the successor to Hubble which launched in December 2021. The system could also be used for space tourism: Elon Musk has promised a trip around the Moon in 2023 to the Japanese online retail billionaire Yusaku Maezawa. It could also carry out high-speed journeys between different destinations on Earth. Musk says that Starship could eventually carry people to destinations in the ""greater Solar System"", including gas giants such as Jupiter. But this remains a long-term objective. In order to bring other spacecraft back to the ground, engineers have relied on parachutes, or designed the vehicle so that it can land on a runway. But the Starship upper stage takes a different approach. When it is ready to land on Earth, the ship initially re-enters the atmosphere at a 60-degree angle and then ""belly-flops"" to the ground in the horizontal position. This mode of return relies entirely on the atmosphere to slow the vehicle's descent. The downside is that, in this configuration, Starship is inherently unstable. The vehicle therefore uses four steel landing flaps, positioned near the front and rear of the vehicle, to control its descent. This is much like a skydiver uses their arms and legs to control a free-fall. ""It's quite different from anything elseâ¦ we're doing a controlled fall,"" Elon Musk says.  ""You're trying to create drag rather than lift - it's really the opposite of an aircraft."" As Starship approaches the ground, it should be slow enough to execute an engine burn that flips the vehicle into a vertical position. It then uses the Raptors as retro-rockets to guide the vehicle down to a safe touchdown on its landing legs. Musk says this general approach could be used to bring Starship down safely on any planetary surface in the Solar System. Eventually, however, Starships returning to Earth - and perhaps other destinations - might not have to do the flip manoeuvre. The ships could instead be captured as they approach the ground by the launch tower's steel arms - just like the Super Heavy booster. Musk explained on Twitter: ""Ship will be caught by Mechazilla too. As with booster, no landing legs. Those are only needed for Moon and Mars until there is local infrastructure.""  In the last few years, SpaceX has tested various prototypes of the upper stage at its Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas. The company started off in 2019 with a 39m-tall ""test article"" called Starhopper - which bore a passing resemblance to a water tower - and flew it to 150m above ground. This video can not be played SN15 launched with improvements in its structures, avionics, software, and engines The first prototype to feature a nosecone and flaps - Starship serial number (SN8) - flew to an altitude of 12.5km in December 2020. It belly flopped back to Earth, giving SpaceX valuable engineering data about the final part of the vehicle's return from space. However, SN8 approached the landing pad a little too fast and hard, causing it to crumple and explode. Three more test articles exploded before Starship SN15 achieved success with a soft landing in May 2021. In February, SpaceX engineersconducted a key test on the rocket system, what's called a ""static fire"", simultaneously igniting 31 out of 33 of the engines at the base of the vehicle's lower-segment. The firing lasted only a few seconds, with everything clamped in place to prevent any movement. Mr Musk tweeted that the team had turned off one engine before the test and that another engine stopped itself, leaving 31 engines firing overall. But, he added, it was ""still enough engines to reach orbit"" The FAA granted a license that would allow SpaceX to perform a test flight for the rocket, which is scheduled for 17 April.  ""After a comprehensive license evaluation process, the FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental, policy, payload, airspace integration and financial responsibility requirements,"" the FAA said in a statement on Friday, adding that the license was valid for five years.

129,"One year after Musk acquired Twitter: Traffic, revenue down across the board",Mashable,2023-11-02,"X's traffic, revenue, and users are way down a year after Elon Musk's take over. Has Musk let that sink in? Credit: Twitter account of Elon Musk/AFP via Getty Images It's Oct. 27, 2023 ...",https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-x-one-year-numbers,"It's Oct. 27, 2023: Exactly one year after Elon Musk took over Twitter.  Much has changed. For one, the platform isn't even called Twitter anymore. Musk changed the name to ""X."" Mashable's Chris Taylor just published a piece looking at some of Musk's biggest decisions that altered the course of the company. In this piece, however, we're going to focus strictly on numbers and the astounding effects of Musk's decisions – and it's not looking too good. The most striking of X's plunging metrics is its daily active user count, a figure that the company has historically focused on to signal growth. In November 2022, around a month after his acquisition, Musk boasted that the platform was growing from more than 254 million daily active users before his takeover to nearly 260 million a month later. However, during an interview at a tech conference last month, X CEO Linda Yaccarino shared that the platform currently has 245 million daily active users per month, a loss of roughly 3.7 percent. In a series of slides that Musk posted last November, he promoted other platform metrics like ""new user sign-ups"" and ""active minutes."" According to the slide, the platform, then still known as Twitter, was pulling in an average of two million new user sign-ups per day. In addition, Musk claimed then that users spend eight billion active minutes on the platform. However, in a new blog post from Yaccarino commemorating the one year anniversary of Musk's take over, the company's data shows drops in those metrics too. According to the post, new daily sign ups are at 1.5 million and active minutes spent on the platform has dropped to 7.8 billion. That's a drop of 500,000 daily sign-ups and 200 million active minutes. Using data from mobile analytics firm Sensor Tower, the Wall Street Journal also found that X is the only major social media platform to experience a loss in daily active mobile users over the past year. Usage has dropped by 16 percent over the past 11 months. Furthermore, when it comes to X's mobile apps, downloads are down, too. But the overall picture here is a much more interesting story. Musk's takeover actually did provide a bump in downloads of X's mobile app for three straight quarters when compared to before the acquisition. However, in the most recent quarter, which includes the period in which Musk changed the name from Twitter to X, mobile app downloads drastically decreased by 38 percent – the platform's lowest app download numbers since 2019. And it's not just a mobile decline either. According to the web analytics firm SimilarWeb, traffic to X's website is down by 14 percent when compared to last year. None of these numbers compare to the decline in X's advertising revenue, however. Musk has struggled to keep advertisers around since the earliest days of his leadership. In his first weeks at the helm, half of the company's biggest advertisers stopped running ads on the platform due to Musk's content moderation decisions and his questionable antics. A report from Reuters earlier this month found that advertising revenue at Musk's company declined every single month since the takeover. Over a 10 month period ending in August, Twitter's overall revenue was down by a whopping 60 percent. One metric where the company did grow was in X Premium subscribers. However, there's more to that, which doesn't paint such a rosy picture. When Elon Musk took over the platform, the subscription service, then known as Twitter Blue, wasn't really a focus of the company. It was treated more like an experiment and had tens of thousands of paying users. Today, with Musk and company depending on X Premium to make-up for billions of dollars in lost ad revenue, third-party estimates say it's pulling in nowhere near that.  In August, Mashable reported on data collected by Travis Brown, an independent researcher that tracks X Premium subscriptions, which found that there were just under one million subscribers. Today, it seems likely there are around 1 million X Premium subscribers in total paying the company $8 per month. But, those totals are far and away from the billions of dollars that X needed to make up from advertisers that left. Compared to Snapchat, a social media competitor who also launched its own paid subscription service last year around the same time as X, Musk's platform isn't looking so good. Snapchat recently announced it had signed up 5 million paying users for its subscription service in just around 12 months. While things aren't looking great for X, it's still chugging along. For now. Musk paid $44 billion for the company and he overpaid by a lot. He's also shared multiple times that the company has yet to become cash-flow positive. And investors are going to see some sort of return on investment at some point. How much longer can Musk's X keep chugging along? We'll probably soon find out.

In response to the post, made by an account named ""End Wokeness"", Mr Musk wrote: ""What a blatant racist!"" As of Friday morning, the post had been seen by more than 500,000 accounts. In the emotional speech in 2020, the now First Minister recited the final words of Mr Floyd before his death while being restrained by police officer Derek Chauvin, which was captured on video and sparked worldwide protests calling for racial equality. Mr Yousaf went on to highlight that the people he dealt with on a daily basis in his portfolio were all white. Reciting the names of the heads of the legal profession, the courts and the police in Scotland at the time, Mr Yousaf punctuated them with the word ""white"", before moving on to the medical profession, trade unions and directors general of the Scottish Government. He concluded by saying: ""That is not good enough."" In a cryptic post on the platform early on Friday, Mr Yousaf uploaded a Gif of Still Game character Navid dancing to depict his feelings, alongside the comment: ""Racists foaming at the mouth at my very existence."" The original post which Mr Musk replied to was made by a prominent right-wing account which has 1.5 million followers and said: ""Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf openly despises white people. ""Why would Scotland's Parliament and King select a guy who hates almost 100% of the country?"" A spokesman for the First Minister said: ""The First Minister has been on the receiving end of racist hate, abuse and death threats his entire life, and has stood firm against hatred and bigotry, of any kind, throughout. ""Sadly, much of the racist abuse and threats of violence the First Minister faces are directed his way on X - formerly known as Twitter.

131,‘Musk destroyed all that’: Twitter’s business is flailing after a year of Elon,The Guardian,2023-10-28,"Advertisers are spending less, regulators are circling, staff is at less than 50% of what it used to be and user numbers are down Elon Musk wrote within hours of buying Twitter that he “didn’t ...",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/27/elon-musk-x-twitter-takeover-revenue-users-advertising,"Advertisers are spending less, regulators are circling, staff is at less than 50% of what it used to be and user numbers are down Elon Musk wrote within hours of buying Twitter that he “didn’t do it because it would be easy”. That statement has proven to be one of the few certainties about his ownership of the influential social media platform, which has tipped the business into a state of constant flux, with advertisers slashing spending, user numbers down, regulators circling and the staff at less than 50% of what it used to be. From dumping a world-renowned brand to attempting to overhaul the company’s business model, Musk has changed Twitter more in the past year than any other executive in the 16 years prior. Musk acquired Twitter on 27 October 2022. The biggest single change in a tumultuous 12 months was rebranding Twitter as X, a long-mooted move for an entrepreneur who has harboured ambitions to create an “everything app” that handles messaging, social networking, audio, video, payments and online shopping. Shortly before he completed the $44bn (£36bn) takeover, Musk signalled what was coming when he described the deal as an “accelerant to creating X, the everything app”. Nonetheless, the sudden dumping of the Twitter brand in July this year took the tech world by surprise. Compared with Facebook and Instagram’s multibillion-person combined user base, Twitter was a modest platform with 238 million daily users – but it was influential and well-known. According to X’s new chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, speaking at a conference last month, the social network now has between 200 million and 250 million users, although she indicated later during her appearance that the number is 225 million – which would indicate a decline. Visits to X dropped 10% on the prior month to 5.8bn in September, according to data firm Similarweb. Bruce Daisley, the former head of Twitter’s European operations, said the rebranding move had damaged a business that was in “brand heaven”. “There was plenty wrong with the product, but the brand was in the top tier of companies in the world,” he said. “Names as diverse as Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian, The Rock and Greta Thunberg would all use the name and help promote the platform. Musk destroyed all of that.” If the rebranding of Twitter signalled a shift in the company’s business model, there was a need for change anyway due to the pressure on its main revenue stream. Advertising accounted for nearly 90% of Twitter’s $5.1bn in annual revenue in 2021. That total has slumped due to an advertiser exodus triggered by fears over moderation standards on the platform and general concerns about Musk’s leadership. In a post last month, Musk said US advertising revenue had fallen 60%, a situation which he blamed on pressure from the Anti-Defamation League, which campaigns against antisemitism and bigotry. With quarterly debt payments of $300m and a fall in the main source of cash to pay it, the company needs to find money elsewhere – if it can. It is against this backdrop that Musk has sought to overhaul the platform’s subscription product, formerly known as Twitter Blue but now branded as X premium. The X rebrand has carried promises of turning the business into an “everything app” modelled on Tencent’s WeChat, dominant in China, that carries out a multitude of tasks from messaging to payments and food deliveries. But even before completing the takeover – a tortuous process in itself – Musk had signalled that he aimed to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising via a subscription drive, which he also hoped would reduce the number of automated accounts vexing the social network. To this end, he oversaw a botched relaunch of the Blue product in November, which resulted in a slew of impersonator accounts operated by pranksters who took up the offer of a verified account checkmark – and all the chaos that could cause if, for instance, you’re not really George W Bush – for $8 a month. Since then, the subscription service has relaunched again with perks, including the verified checkmark and greater prominence on the platform for your posts. According to one estimate from Travis Brown, a software developer who tracked Twitter Blue sign-ups, the number of subscriptions had reached more than 600,000 by April this year, or more than $5m a month in extra revenue which is not enough to cover a multibillion-dollar advertising slump. Last week Musk went a step further, following up on hints that he was going to charge to access the site by rolling out a $1 annual charge to new users in New Zealand and the Philippines. The policy was dubbed “Not a Bot” by X, following the logic that spammers won’t want to pay up for every troll account they launch. Musk also indicated that two new subscription tiers will be coming: one with “higher cost” that features no ads; and another “lower cost” option with all the extra features, but no reductions in ads. Bruce Daisley, the former head of Twitter’s European operations, says that trying to diversify away from advertising is “strategically a good call” but it has been badly handled. “With the changes he has made, not least bringing in paid verification, he has served to reduce the quality of the platform. When you include the capricious decision-making, advertisers have said: ‘We don’t want to be part of that.’” One of Musk’s first acts as owner of Twitter was firing approximately 50% of the platform’s 7,500 staff. Evan Hansen, then a director of curation at the platform, was among the thousands of people axed abruptly by an owner who had claimed before the takeover that the platform had a “very far-left” bias. “He believed that our team was biased … that the entire moderation team was actively promoting liberal conversations and being partial with conservative ones,” says Hansen, who had had a long career as a respected tech journalist before joining Twitter in 2016. Hansen says his team would “nourish a variety of viewpoints” via features such as Twitter Moments or ensure that readers “experienced perspectives that they would otherwise not encounter”. That service included demoting toxic trending subjects or putting a representative tweet in hashtag timelines to explain why certain subjects were trending. Referring to the social network now, Hansen says: “Our work is completely gone.” Musk has reinstated previously banned users such as Donald Trump and the misogynist influencer Andrew Tate, while also arbitrarily banning tech journalists who crossed his path. In September, Musk posted on his X account that he had disbanded X’s election integrity team ahead of more than 70 elections around the globe in the coming year. Musk and Yaccarino are pushing X’s crowd-sourced fact-checking feature, Community Notes, as a key element of its moderation systems. But doubts have been raised over its ability to cope with a deluge of misinformation related to the Israel-Hamas war. The social network’s approach to content moderation, and general concerns about Musk’s leadership, have hurt the business by warding off advertisers. Farhad Divecha, owner and managing director of the London-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, says X’s standing among advertisers has plummeted. Since that initial wave of firings, X’s workforce was reduced further to about 1,500, Musk said in April. “The past 12 months have seen Twitter go from a solid third or fourth option – after Google, Meta and occasionally LinkedIn – for digital advertising to the bottom of the pile,” he said. “Changes to brand safety, opening up the network to extremists under the guise of free speech, requiring advertisers to pay for verification, and firing a lot of the staff have sent signals that the platform doesn’t care about brand safety or advertisers.” X’s handling of hateful or misleading content has come under further scrutiny in the wake of the Hamas attack on Israel. Thierry Breton, the EU commissioner responsible for the bloc’s Digital Services Act, has written to Musk alleging that the platform is “being used to disseminate illegal content and disinformation in the EU”. Meta (the owner of Facebook and Instagram) and TikTok have also been warned about Israel-Hamas coverage on their platforms, but X’s issues threaten to compound its problems with advertisers. Musk fired Twitter’s chief executive, Parag Agrawal, as soon as the billionaire completed the deal and took over running the platform. Tumult ensued. In a nod to the damage done to the cornerstone of X’s business model, in May Musk appointed a renowned advertising industry executive as CEO. Yaccarino, then head of global advertising at media and entertainment conglomerate NBCUniversal, is highly respected within her field. She has moved to repair the company’s relationship with advertisers by reinstating a “client council” for marketing and ad agency executives but admitted she has found the job hard. “It’s hard. It’s hard on me. It’s hard on my family, my children, my parents,” she told the Financial Times. Yaccarino told a conference in September that X would be profitable next year (the platform is historically loss-making), that engagement from users was up “dramatically” and that advertisers were coming back, despite indicating that daily users numbers had dropped to around 225 million. Banks expect to take a $2bn hit, according to The Wall Street Journal. Musk remains heavily involved in running X, with an executive role focused on product design, new technology and tweeting a lot. Yaccarino needs to ensure that advertisers are around to fund Musk’s planned transformation. She also has regulatory pressures to deal with. The US Department of Justice is investigating whether the “chaotic environment” at the platform under Musk violated a government order requiring an overhaul of its data security and privacy practices, while the US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the Tesla CEO’s actions ahead of the deal. “It’s a new day at X,” Yaccarino said in September. Some users, advertisers and former employees, however, are nostalgic for the old days."
132,EU warns Elon Musk over ‘disinformation’ on X about Hamas attack,The Guardian,2023-10-13,Failing to moderate content such as fake news could incur fine of 6% of X revenues or EU blackout under new laws The EU has issued a warning to Elon Musk over the alleged disinformation about the ...,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/10/eu-warns-elon-musk-over-disinformation-about-hamas-attack-on-x?ref=upstract.com,"Failing to moderate content such as fake news could incur fine of 6% of X revenues or EU blackout under new laws  The EU has issued a warning to Elon Musk over the alleged disinformation about the Hamas attack on Israel, including fake news and “repurposed old images”, on X, which was formerly known as Twitter. The letter arrives less than two months after sweeping new laws regulating content on social media seen in the EU came into force under the Digital Services Act. If Musk, the owner of X, does not comply he can face a fine of 6% of his revenues from X or a total blackout in the EU. Thierry Breton, the commissioner responsible for the act, wrote to Musk to urge him to ensure “a prompt, accurate, and complete response” to the request to contact Europol, the EU police enforcement agency, and “relevant law enforcement agencies” within the next 24 hours. Breton reminded Musk that he needed to have “proportionate and effective mitigation measures to tackle the risks to public security and civic discourse stemming from disinformation”. “Following the terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas against Israel, we have indications your platform is being used to disseminate illegal content and disinformation in the EU,” wrote Breton. “Public media and civil society organisations widely report instances of fake and manipulated images and facts circulating on your platform in the EU, such as repurposed old images of unrelated armed conflicts or military footage that actually originated from video games. This appears to be manifestly false or misleading information,” he said. “Let me remind you that the Digital Services Act sets very precise obligations regarding content moderation,” Breton said, adding that changes in X’s public interest policies raised questions about his compliance to the new rules. Musk quit a voluntary code of practice set up by the EU earlier this year to enable social media companies to put in place systems to comply with the new laws. Facebook, Google, TikTok and other companies are participating in the code of practice and are removing disinformation under the new rules. He responded to Breton on X saying: “Please list the violations you allude to on X, so that the public can see them.” In a reference to the law’s requirement that platforms regulate their own content under the new laws Breton replied: “Up to you to demonstrate that you walk the talk.” Breton’s strongly worded letter told Musk: “First, you need to be very transparent and clear on what content is permitted under your terms and consistently and diligently enforce your own policies. This is particularly relevant when it comes to violent and terrorist content that appears to circulate on your platform. Your latest changes in public interest policies that occurred over night left many European users uncertain. “Second, when you receive notices of illegal content in the EU, you must be timely, diligent and objective in taking action and removing the relevant content when warranted. We have, from qualified sources, reports about potentially illegal content circulating on your service despite flags from relevant authorities.” Under the new laws social media companies must respond to complaints about illegal content within 24 hours. They can dispute complaints by users, but there is an appeal process for consumers. There are concerns in Brussels that Twitter is not responding within 24 hours to complaints about disinformation or other illegal content such as hate speech within the required time. Breton asked Musk to “urgently ensure that your systems are effective” and to report back immediately to the EU over the crisis measures he has taken. “Given the urgency, I also expect you to be in contact with the relevant law enforcement authorities and Europol, and ensure that you respond promptly to their requests,” Breton added. In its briefings to press on the Digital Services Act, the EU has explained that those who are not participating in the voluntary code of practice will not be eligible to argue “mitigating” factors if it comes to punitive measures taken in Brussels. Breton told Musk: “We will include your answer in our assessment file on your compliance with the DSA. I remind you that following the opening of a potential investigation and a finding of non-compliance, penalties can be imposed.” X came under scrutiny in the past few days after concerns were raised about fake posts and Elon Musk’s recommendation of war coverage from accounts that have made false claims or antisemitic comments. Musk recommended two accounts on Sunday, writing: “For following the war in real-time, @WarMonitors and @sentdefender are good. It is also worth following direct sources on the ground. Please add interesting options in the replies below.”"

Billionaires like nothing more than casting themselves as popular liberators, but the acquisition fitted the pattern of his ever-expanding empire. Musk has colonised areas of the economy from which public funding and regulation have been in retreat. His carmaker, Tesla, is shaping the future of transport; SpaceX, meanwhile, has in many ways replaced Nasa on the final frontier (so far this year it has launched 75 spacecraft). Musk told himself and the world that he had acquired Twitter (now renamed X) to create “a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner”. The subtext of that naive homily was: what’s the point in being the one of richest men in the world if you can’t corner the market in free speech? One year on, Musk has, step by step, reshaped his platform in his own erratic image. The traditional wisdom of Twitter was: “Each day on Twitter there is one main character. The goal is never to be it.” Musk has inverted that message. The site’s algorithm ensured that his voice is the most prominent on a daily basis (he has 160.5 million followers). When he took over, the anxiety was that he would remove the checks and balances that had been implemented in response to the crisis in American democracy seen after the election of Donald Trump, and in populist governments across the world. Social media had accepted its culpability in profiting from division. In the event Musk has, in plain sight – and to an often sycophantic audience, mesmerised by his billions – doubled down on that fear, restoring a platform for conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers, personally amplifying attacks on what he delights in calling “legacy” (ie fact-checked) media and public servants, implementing strategies that amplify the set of corrosive attitudes pushed by Trump and the American right: the demonising of refugees, the imaginary “LGBT” agenda to sexualise children, the “war on woke”. Musk’s tweeting activity features more rocket launches than a North Korean propaganda film but, read collectively over the course of this year, also delivers insights into the ever-hardening politics of a man whose unnerving ambition is to own “the world’s consciousness”. 26 October 2022 ‘Let that sink in!’ Musk arrived at Twitter HQ in San Francisco carrying a bathroom sink. The tech bro “joke” was that tech bro “jokes” and much else besides were now allowed on “liberated” Twitter. The implications of that new less-than-serious ownership were established a couple of days later when Musk replied to a post by Hillary Clinton that expressed outrage at conspiracy theories surrounding the brutal attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of the speaker of the House of Representatives. Musk intervened to amplify those theories, linking to an article on a notorious fake news site, the Santa Monica Observer. How we chuckled. 20 November ‘The people have spoken. Trump will be reinstated. Vox Populi, Vox Dei’ Musk began unbanning Twitter accounts that had been removed after the 6 January insurrection, beginning, symbolically, with former president Trump’s. During his first visit to Twitter HQ, he had insisted that there was no truth in rumours that he would lay off 75% of its 7,500 staff. He was true to his word. He laid off about 80%, including the vast majority of those who policed the site for hate speech and conspiracy. He also dissolved the trust and safety council, an advisory group created in 2016 to address problems of child exploitation, suicide and self-harm on the platform. During that month’s elections in Brazil, in which misinformation fomented another insurrection against a democratic result, Musk was reportedly making ad hoc calls on guideline breaches himself. 12 December ‘The woke mind virus is either defeated or nothing else matters’ Until about 2020 Musk had supported Democratic causes: he donated money to the Obama and Hillary Clinton presidential campaigns. That loose conviction seems to have been undone by Covid restrictions. “This is fascist,” he said. “This is not democratic. Give people back their goddam freedom.” The rightward shift in his politics coincided with the fact that his eldest child, Vivian, had come out as a trans woman (she changed her surname in 2022, saying in a courtroom filing, “I no longer wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form”). Musk blamed the breakdown in their relationship on “communist” indoctrination at a private school she attended in Los Angeles. Among documents disclosed during Musk’s acquisition of Twitter were texts from his ex-wife, British actor Talulah Riley, which urged: “Please do something to fight woke-ism. I will do anything to help! xx.” 15 January 2023 ‘Instagram makes people depressed & Twitter makes people angry. Which is better?’ In his authorised biography, Walter Isaacson suggested that that Musk had misunderstood Twitter. “He thought of it as a technology company,” Isaacson wrote, “when in fact it is an advertising medium based on human emotions and relationships.” This tweet gestured toward that misconception. Musk, who identifies himself as having Asperger syndrome, struggles to understand why the rest of humanity does not share his philosophy of infinite possibility. The vitriol he monetises on Twitter appears a constant challenge to his $250bn optimism. One defence, as the Wall Street Journalsubsequently reported, was that Musk was self-medicating with ketamine, the horse-tranquilliser party drug, whose side-effects include disassociation and hallucination. In response to the article, Musk tweeted that from what he’d seen with friends, “ketamine taken occasionally is a better option” than prescribed antidepressants. Eight million people viewed that endorsement. 3 February ‘ Starting today, Twitter will share ad revenue with creators for ads that appear in their reply threads’ Amid reports that Twitter was losing $4m a day, Musk launched a plan to boost advertising revenue by encouraging users to subscribe and create content in order to access a minuscule share of profits. This Uber-style model of maximum revenue with minimum responsibility exposed the flaw of “citizen journalism”. In the absence of any viable system of fact-checking or transparent accountability, the model seemed inevitably weighted towards the kind of extreme opinion and unhinged content that guaranteed the most hits and likes. 28 March ‘Trying my best for the humans’ Musk appears to be driven by a sense, nurtured in a lifetime of video-game playing, that he alone can save the world from climate change or AI catastrophe. At the centre of that belief is his Mars mission and the dream of a “multiplanet civilisation”. One mantra that emerges from Isaacson’s book is: “If I don’t make decisions, we die.” Thousands of faithful followers on Twitter love nothing more than reinforcing those cultish fantasies. This tweet came in response to a message describing Musk as “one of the most selfless of humans”. Isaacson believes that Musk wanted to buy Twitter because he had been bullied as a kid both by his father and at school and “now he could own the playground”. 9 April ‘All news is to some degree propaganda. Let people decide for themselves’ Musk undermined the authority of independent news sources with the mission and resources to provide accurate journalism – the BBC, NPR in America – by adding the line “state-sponsored media” to their posts, grouping them with blatant propaganda from Russia Today and the Chinese government. Though that policy was revised after protest, the mission, it seemed, was to give all information equal weight. How people could “decide for themselves” what was true from that avalanche of competing, unsourced news was not explained. 16 May ‘Soros reminds me of Magneto’ By comparing the investor George Soros, to Magneto, the supervillain in X-Men comic books, Musk referred to the antisemitic tropes of the alt-right. When investigative journalist Brian Krassenstein argued that “Soros, a Holocaust survivor [like Magneto], gets attacked nonstop for his good intentions” Musk suggested that Soros “hates humanity”. He did not disclose that Soros Fund Management had the day before sold its entire stake in Tesla. 20 June ‘I’m up for a cage match if he is lol’ When Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg launched a competitor to Twitter called Threads, Musk challenged him to a cage fight. Zuckerberg, who reportedly spends his leisure time practising jiu-jitsu, accepted. Musk has so far not come up with a date for the fight, claiming a back injury. The juvenile exchange was a reminder of the words Musk whispered into the ear of his first wife Justine, by her account, at their wedding reception dance: “I’m the Alpha in this relationship.” If the cage fight ever does take place, it is to be hoped that no one anywhere tunes in to the livestream. 23 July ‘X goes live’ Musk has had a superstitious obsession with the letter X since he invested in the online bank X.com. The letter now features in all his companies and is part of the ludicrous name of his son with the artist Grimes: X Æ A-12. Rebranding Twitter – and dropping the blue bird which was among the most effective symbols in corporate history – was, at best, an example of his unlimited faith in his own instincts. The sinister X branding was claimed as the first step toward his long-term goal of creating a universal “everything app” on which the world would communicate, bank and shop. If Musk had wanted to look like a real-life Bond villain, he could hardly have been more explicit. 25 August ‘Next-level’ Trump signalled his return to Twitter by posting the mugshot from his booking at Fulton County Jail on charges of election interference. Musk retweeted that with the words “Next-level”. To give a flavour of Twitter in the coming election year, he also heavily promoted an interview between sacked Fox News provocateur Tucker Carlson and Trump, which was said to have had 265m views. Carlson has been interviewing a series of far-right leaders for X, including Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Argentina’s extreme populist candidate Javier Milei. “You have to be prepared and fight the culture wars every day … ” Milei told him. “Very interesting talk that goes far beyond Argentina,” Musk tweeted. 29 September: ‘Went to Eagle Pass border crossing to see what’s really going on’ Pre-empting another Trump campaign, Musk spent much of September in a cowboy hat, concentrating the anxieties of his followers on the porous southern border, by livestreaming reports of illegal immigration at Eagle Pass in Texas. His stilted vox pops with local sheriffs were punctuated with frequent appeals to his screen: “Is this working?” The reports suggested that he really wanted to be a local radio reporter when he grew up, but still had a way to go. 8 October ‘For following the war in real-time, @WarMonitors and @sentdefender are good’ Just how much Musk had to learn about news was shown by this since-deleted tweet after the 7 October Hamas atrocities. The recommended sites were both quickly shown to have spread fake news and @WarMonitors had made antisemitic comments. In the following days, X was flooded with unverifiable content, which overwhelmed its new “community notes” feature, (in which an approved group of users adds fact-checked commentary to unreliable tweets). Musk was reduced to posting lame threats to sites he had promoted: “Please use maximally accurate words or I must withdraw my recommendation to follow your account.” The war sharpened focus on the EU’s new Digital Services Act, which has powers to hold social media to account for failure to take steps to prevent the spread of misinformation. Unlike Facebook and Google, Musk has refused to sign X up to the code of practice, but that will not protect it from huge fines or a potential blackout. On Wednesday, Thierry Breton, the commissioner responsible for the act, contacted Musk, demanding that he contact Europol to explain the breaches. The entrepreneur was otherwise engaged promoting his favourite new T-shirt, which asked: “What would Orwell think?” No doubt he would have seen Musk coming."

The billionaire has also laid off more than half the company’s staff and introduced a new subscription model in an effort to find new revenue streams as advertisers flee the site, and sparked a number of controversies. Here is a look back at some of the key moments of Mr Musk’s tenure so far. – 2022: Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in! pic.twitter.com/D68z4K2wq7 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 26, 2022 – October 27: Mr Musk tweets a video of himself walking into Twitter HQ carrying a sink with the caption “let that sink in” as he takes control of the company after a protracted and often tense takeover process. Then, in his first act as owner, Mr Musk sacks several top executives. – November 4: Twitter begins laying off more than half its global workforce by sending out blanket emails to staff as part of what the company calls necessary cost-cutting – legal action from staff around the world follows claiming breaches of employment law. – November 9: After Mr Musk promised an overhaul of verification on the site, Twitter starts adding grey “Official” badges to prominent accounts, only for these to then disappear hours later. – November 10: Twitter Blue, the updated paid-for subscription which allows anyone to buy a blue tick verified badge for their account, starts rolling out in select countries. It is paused a day later after a number of incidents of impersonation, with bad actors posing as verified public figures and tweeting offensive and inappropriate content. Mr Musk later says it will return once improvements have been made. – November 16: In an email to the company’s remaining staff, the billionaire tells workers they must agree to be more “hardcore” and work longer, more intense hours in order to build “Twitter 2.0”. Mr Musk says staff who do not agree to this ultimatum will be let go. – November 18: More Twitter staff flee the company as the “hardcore” work deadline passes and the company temporarily closes its offices around the world as concerns surface about the site’s ability to stay online amid the exodus. – November 20: The Twitter boss reinstates the account of former US president Donald Trump after asking Twitter users to vote on the issue. Mr Trump had been banned since a pro-Trump mob attacked the US Capitol on January 6 2021 as Congress was poised to certify Joe Biden’s election victory. – November 24: Mr Musk says he is granting an “amnesty” to other previously suspended accounts after hosting a Twitter poll on the issue, allowing them to return to the site, something online safety experts say would lead to new waves of abuse and harassment on the platform. – November 29: It is discovered that Twitter has quietly ended the enforcement of its rules which prevented the spread of misinformation around Covid-19 and vaccines. – November 30: Amid rising concerns around Twitter’s content moderation approach, EU officials warn Mr Musk that Twitter must comply with its new online safety rules or face being banned. – December 1: Mr Musk says he has “resolved” a “misunderstanding” with Apple after he had claimed the iPhone maker was threatening to remove Twitter from its App Store. He had also criticised the company’s app store fees and accused the company of hating free speech. – December 2: Kanye West, who had been reinstated to Twitter as part of Mr Musk’s amnesty, is suspended again for posting antisemitic content. – December 9: Sir Elton John says he is leaving Twitter over concerns about misinformation being allowed to flourish under Mr Musk’s free speech rules. – December 12: Twitter Blue relaunches with a higher monthly price for iPhone users as Mr Musk looks to offset Apple’s App Store developer fees. The grey “Official” badges also make another return. – December 13: Twitter’s Trust and Safety Council, an advisory group of nearly 100 independent civil, human rights and other organisations that helps the firm combat harmful content on the site, is dissolved. – December 16: Twitter suspends the accounts of a number of journalists who had written about Mr Musk and his banning of an account that used publicly available information to track the flights made by his private jet. – December 18: The site says it will no longer allow links to certain other social media platforms to be posted – including Facebook and Instagram, as well as possible rivals such as Mastodon. However, tweets about the new policy and a webpage linked to it are later deleted and Mr Musk apologises. – December 19: Mr Musk says he will abide by a new poll in which he asks if he should step down as the head of Twitter. He warns users that they should be be careful what they wish for. That poll saw 57.5% of people say he should leave his role, with more than 17.5 million votes cast. – 2023: I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter! @LindaYacc will focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design & new technology. Looking forward to working with Linda to transform this platform into X, the everything app. https://t.co/TiSJtTWuky — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 12, 2023 – February 9: Twitter is hit by a substantial outage that tells users they have exceeded the rate limit and cannot see new posts or tweet themselves. Another two outages hit the site in early March as some suggest staff cuts are effecting the firm’s ability to keep the platform online. – March 24: Twitter confirms it will begin removing “legacy checkmarks” given out as part of the old verification system, as they are replaced by those who have paid for the verified badge as part of Twitter Blue. But confusion reigns for several weeks as blue ticks remain in place for some high-profile figures. – May 11: Mr Musk confirms he has appointed a mystery woman to take over from him as chief executive of Twitter. It is later revealed to be NBC Universal executive, Linda Yaccarino. – June 1: Figures from financial services firm Fidelity suggest Twitter may be worth a third of what Mr Musk paid for it in October 2022 thanks to Musk’s chaotic tenure so far. – June 22: As officials in the EU and Australia warn Twitter over its handling of online hate content, Mr Musk challenges Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg to a cage fight after rumours circulate that Meta is preparing to launch a Twitter rival called Threads. Mr Zuckerberg later says he has “moved on” from the bizarre online feud. – July 6: Meta launches Threads and hits 10 million users within hours of going live. The launch comes just days after Twitter began limiting the number of posts users could see in a day, a decision Mr Musk claims is to combat “system manipulation and data scraping” but is condemned by experts as a bizarre move for a social media platform needing active users. If a good enough X logo is posted tonight, we’ll make go live worldwide tomorrow — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 23, 2023 July 24: Mr Musk confirms Twitter is rebranding as X and unveils a new logo to replace the bird icon that had been in place since the platform’s creation. Mr Musk has the Twitter sign removed from the company’s San Francisco headquarters, but the work is temporarily halted over permit issues. Meanwhile, the ‘X’ logo he has placed on the building’s roof is also quickly removed over similar permit issues. July 30: Kanye West’s account is reinstated on the platform after a nearly eight-month suspension for violating its rules around inciting violence. The rapper was suspended in December 2022 for a range of erratic posts which included one image which appeared to show a swastika and a Jewish star. He has previously been suspended in October 2022 over antisemitic posts. September 5: Mr Musk threatens to sue campaign group the Anti-Defamation League over lost revenue for the platform, claiming it and others have lobbied advertisers to leave the site and decimated its income stream. September 19: Mr Musk hints during a panel appearance that all X users could be asked to pay to use the platform in the future – a month later the company begins a trial in New Zealand and the Philippines where new users are charged an annual fee of one US dollar in order to post on the site. October 10: The EU’s digital chief warns X and Mr Musk over misinformation spreading on the platform linked to the Israel-Hamas conflict. It later opens an investigation into the firm on the issue, while X says it has removed hundreds of Hamas-linked accounts in response to the concerns.

The regulators published a 35-page analysis, predicting that 28,000 hazardous fragments from de-orbiting satellites could survive reentry over the next 12 years. Musk plans to have at least 42,000 Starlinks in orbit in the coming years - the most of any company. SpaceX's Starlinks would represent more than 85 percent of the expected risk to people on the ground and aviation from falling debris in the timeframe, the report claims. Musk's SpaceX is not taking the allegations lying down - the company's principal engineer called the analysis 'preposterous, unjustified and inaccurate' in a letter to the FAA and Congress. A new Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) report warns Elon Musk's Starlink satellites could kill or seriously injure someone by 2035 Here, 60 Starlink satellites can be seen stacked together over Earth before their deployment on May 24, 2019 SpaceX principal engineer David Goldstein said the report relied on 'deeply flawed analysis,' according to CNN. 'To be clear, SpaceX's satellites are designed and built to fully demise during atmospheric reentry during disposal at the end of life, and they do so,' the letter reads. The company also criticized the Aerospace Corporation, a nonprofit that compiled the data, for not contacting SpaceX for more information.  The letter also states that 325 Starlink satellites have been deorbited since February 2020, and no debris has been found. The Aerospace Corporation issued a statement Tuesday, saying it approached SpaceX two years ago 'to do an independent assessment of collective risks associated with satellite re-entry, based upon the projection of all planned operators under U.S. regulation in 2021. 'The data included existing and planned constellations through 2035. The greatest percentage of satellites were those in Low Earth Orbit.'  Musk's SpaceX is not taking the allegations lightly - the company's principal engineer called to analysis preposterous, unjustified and inaccurate' in a letter to the FAA and Congress NASA has said peppering low Earth orbit with a large number of satellites could 'impact science and human spaceflight missions.' But the report warns it could lead to space debris falling from orbit and surviving re-entry Along with potential human casualties, the report states that air travel could also be threatened by falling space debris.  Footage posted by an X user shows thousands of little orange dots, representing the satellites orbiting the planet and illustrating the vast scale of his investment.  'The probability of an aircraft downing accident (defined in the Aerospace report as a collision with an aircraft downing object) in 2035 would be 0.0007 per year,' the document reads. SpaceX launched Starlink satellites in May 2019, sending over 5,000 mass-produced objects into space. The company announced reaching over 2 million subscribers in September 2023 and plans to deploy 12,000 satellites - a goal that could be raised to 42,000. The SpaceX Starlink is a low-orbit satellite that provides internet with unlimited data and quick broadband speeds. The satellites offer users fixed-location or portable internet options for a hefty price. Internet provider T-Mobile provides broadband for $50 monthly with no installation fee - while Starlink charges up to $2,500 for installation and can cost users up to $250 a month. New research showed that low-frequency radio waves - like those produced by Musk's machines - are leaking into the sky, making it difficult for scientists to make astronomical observations. Scientists are also concerned that Musk's 'space junk' could cause an extreme collision event.  The 'Kessler syndrome' - proposed by NASA scientist Donald Kessler in 1978 - said that if there is too much space junk in the Earth's orbit, then the objects could collide and make MORE space junk. This would result in Earth's orbit becoming unstable.

This year, the world's ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-66777096?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"He is ""very impressed"" with Emmanuel Macron. Narendra Modi can count him as ""a fan"". And Benjamin Netanyahu just dropped in to see him. A parade of foreign leaders on recent US trips, including on official state visits at the White House's invitation, have added sit-downs with Elon Musk to their schedules. This year, the world's richest man has met with, to name a few, the heads of France, Italy, India, South Korea - and, in just the past two days, Turkey and Israel. Yet while the mercurial billionaire is more highly sought after than ever, there is no love lost between him and the Biden administration. And as the outspoken contrarian's political reach expands, including by wading into sensitive geopolitical issues, there is growing unease for some over Mr Musk's power and access.   Some foreign leaders are seeking an economic and electric vehicle industry boost from a new Tesla factory or an infrastructure investment from SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet services. Others have discussed X, the Musk-owned platform formerly known as Twitter, and the future of artificial intelligence. French President Macron has courted the tech mogul three times since December, a charm offensive driven by the desire for a new Tesla gigafactory in his country. Similar entreaties have come from Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in June and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan this past Sunday in New York. And though Mr Musk had just been in New York ahead of this week's United Nations General Assembly, Israeli PM Netanyahu flew to California for an AI conversation with him on Monday. The latter discussion took place against the backdrop of Mr Musk's simmering feud with the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish civil rights organisation. The ADL and other groups have released findings that suggest hate speech has grown dramatically on X since he bought the site last year and changed its moderation rules. Mr Netanyahu - who has previously tweeted admiration for Mr Musk's ""genius & impact on humanity"" - encouraged him in their live-streamed conversation on Monday to ""find the balance"" between protecting free speech and punishing hate speech. It was not the first time he has had to answer for concerns with X since he took over. His sit-down with Indian PM Modi in June came on the heels of ex-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's allegation that the Indian government had threatened to shut down the site if it did not comply with orders to take down content. Those in the pre-Musk era of the company had largely pushed back against such demands, but Mr Musk said he could not do so. ""If we don't obey local government laws, we will get shut down so the best we can do is to hew close to the law in any given country, but it is impossible for us to do more than that or we'll be blocked and our people will be arrested,"" he told reporters after the Modi meeting. While many of these meetings have ostensibly focused on Mr Musk's significant business interests, they come as he wields - and increasingly asserts - influence over global geopolitics. Recent statements from the South African-born US citizen have been interpreted in some corners as an affront to US interests, as well as those of the broader global West. Last week, he left Taiwanese officials fuming with apparently offhand comments on Beijing's 'One-China' policy, suggesting the self-governed island is ""analogous to like Hawaii or something like that, an integral part of China that is arbitrarily not part of China"". Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu shot back on X: ""Listen up, Taiwan is not part of the PRC & certainly not for sale!"" The spat gave fuel to claims by Musk critics that he is quick to acquiesce to the demands of other countries, even when they are US adversaries. ""Hope Elon Musk can also ask the CCP to open X to its people,"" Mr Wu wrote. ""Perhaps he thinks banning it is a good policy, like turning off Starlink to thwart Ukraine's counterstrike against Russia."" The Starlink claim - that the entrepreneur ""secretly told his engineers to turn off coverage"" to prevent a Ukrainian sneak attack on the Russian naval fleet in Crimea - concerned US allies. But amid strong pushback from Mr Musk, author Walter Isaacson began walking back the claim as his book was hitting shelves, writing on X that Starlink coverage up to Crimea was never in fact enabled. Neither Mr Isaacson nor Mr Musk responded to requests for comment from the BBC. The Isaacson book, however, claims elsewhere that, before Mr Musk made his decision, Russia's ambassador to the US ""explicitly told him that a Ukrainian attack on Crimea would lead to a nuclear response"". And after he tweeted out a peace proposal last year that led one Ukrainian official to question whether he had ""been hacked by Russians"", political scientist Ian Bremmer dropped a bombshell on X. ""elon musk told me he had spoken with putin and the kremlin directly about ukraine. he also told me what the kremlin's red lines were,"" he wrote. Mr Musk denied the allegation, but Mr Bremmer doubled down: ""i've long admired musk as a unique and world-changing entrepreneur, which i've said publicly. he's not a geopolitics expert."" The next month, when asked if Mr Musk was a threat to US national security, President Biden replied that his ""cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at"". That is the tip of the iceberg in a frosty relationship - the White House tends to avoid mention of Tesla in its public comments on the electric vehicle industry, talking instead about unionised car-makers, while Mr Musk tangles online with top Democrats, says he can ""no longer support"" the party and flirts with Republican presidential challengers. Ashlee Vance, a Musk biographer who has covered him for more than a decade, argues that Mr Musk has been feeling frustrated and under-appreciated. ""This is a guy who likes to get a lot of [expletive] done, he thinks he's right, and he never likes things getting in his way,"" Mr Vance told the BBC. ""He was already this material wildcard, [the Biden administration] poured gasoline on the fire and they now have zero goodwill with which to try to rein him in."" The runaway success of Tesla and SpaceX have helped transform Mr Musk from genius innovator to celebrity icon. ""In the span of about 25 years, you could argue he has accomplished more than any other human being,"" said Mr Vance. ""He stands out in history of doing this across different industries on an unparalleled scale."" This video can not be played Watch: Musk takes son to meet Turkish President Erdogan But Mr Musk's growing wealth and political evolution over the past few years has also dovetailed with a more divisive and polarising public image, driven in part by his always-online, troll-happy persona on X. ""He's always been this guy who was very sure of his opinions on things and not afraid to express them,"" Mr Vance said. ""He used to play both sides to benefit his companies. He was pretty methodical, didn't talk about politics too much and, anytime he was talking about politics, it was around an issue like climate change."" Since 2017 or 2018, however, the billionaire has begun to caricature his public persona, he says. ""He says whatever comes to his mind. He's alienating people for no reason. He's sort of undermining himself at a time when his companies are actually doing really well."" ""In person, he's actually not the Twitter character at all,"" Mr Vance continued. ""Over time, he's become more sociable, he's extremely rational and interesting, and he's a very different person.""  Noam Cohen, a former New York Times tech columnist and author of The Know-It-Alls: The Rise of Silicon Valley as a Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ball, takes a slightly different view. He believes that Mr Musk's singular ambition and vision have made him an over-achiever in business as well as a ""quasi-governmental"" force. In his telling, Mr Musk has combined ""the physical"" - large factories, lots of employees and valuable products - with ""the digital"" - control over how information spreads. And no other tech titan, whether like Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos, has matched that, according to Mr Cohen.

If he was just a multinational corporation, it would be normal that, if he wants factories in China, he meets with China."" And yet, he adds, Mr Musk has fallen into many of the same pitfalls as his Silicon Valley peers. ""They basically see the world the same way: you're out for yourself, there's no social safety net, you've got to work hard and the best rise to the top,"" Mr Cohen said. ""It's a combination of greed, and a basic mindset that sees intelligence as being the most important factor and the smartest people should run the world."" Mr Cohen says the fact that Mr Musk and other unelected moguls can make unilateral decisions with significant geopolitical consequences is a warning about wealth concentration and waning democracy. ""Is it acceptable for him to be in a position where he can decide whether the satellites go on or not? Is it acceptable for him to lay the public square?"" he asked.

138,What is Elon Musk's Starship space vehicle?,BBC,2023-10-12,"Elon Musk is developing a vehicle that could be a game-changer for space travel. Starship, as it's known, will be a fully reusable transport system capable of carrying up to 100 people to the Red ...",https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-55564448,"This video can not be played Watch the moment Starship's launch was halted Elon Musk is developing a vehicle that could be a game-changer for space travel. Starship, as it's known, will be a fully reusable transport system capable of carrying up to 100 people to the Red Planet. Mr Musk's private spaceflight company SpaceX tried to get Starship airborne on Monday, April 17 but postponed the launch because of a pressurisation issue.  SpaceX could try to launch again later this week. This article takes an in-depth look at the project. The founding ethos of SpaceX was to make life multi-planetary. He says that settling humans on other worlds, such as Mars, could preserve civilisation if Earth were to experience a cataclysm, such as a large asteroid impact.   ""History is going to bifurcate along two directions. One path is we stay on Earth forever, and then there will be some eventual extinction event,"" Musk said in 2016. ""The alternative is to become a spacefaring civilisation and a multi-planet species, which I hope you would agree is the right way to go."" The SpaceX founder has often spoken about his dream of building cities on Mars. He believes that settlements would need large numbers of people in order to become self-sustaining. Realising this dream requires a vehicle that's up to the task. Starship is a rocket and spacecraft combination that could ferry more than 100 people a time to the Red Planet. The system is designed to be fully and rapidly reusable. Being fully reusable means the principal hardware elements are not discarded in the sea or allowed to burn up, as happens with some other launch systems, but return to the ground so they can be flown again.  Rapid reusability means that after coming back from space, Starship can be re-filled with propellant and be ready to launch again in a short period of time - like an aircraft. This reduces the cost of the whole enterprise. At launch, the spacecraft, called Starship, will sit atop a rocket called Super Heavy. The combined system will stand 120m (394ft) -tall and is also referred to as Starship. Let's take the spacecraft first. With its nosecone and landing fins, the stainless-steel vehicle resembles the rocket-ships from the golden age of science fiction.  At the rear of the 50m (160ft) -long craft are six highly efficient Raptor engines, developed over the course of a decade by SpaceX. The combustion takes place in stages, and the engine's design cuts the amount of propellant that's wasted. Towards the middle of the vehicle are the propellant tanks. These feed liquid methane (CH4) and liquid oxygen (O2) to the Raptors. Methane is the fuel and oxygen acts as an oxidiser - a chemical that makes the fuel burn. The combination is dubbed methalox.  The choice of fuel is unusual for rocket engines, but methane can generate plenty of thrust. It's also a prudent choice in light of Musk's designs on Mars. The SpaceX founder says that CH4 could be synthesised from Martian subsurface water and from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), using a chemical process known as the Sabatier reaction. Re-fuelling Starship for the return trip to Earth using Martian resources would confer a level of self-sufficiency, making journeys both more feasible and cost-effective. Towards the front of the spacecraft - which is sometimes referred to as the upper stage - is a huge payload compartment that will be able to haul large cargo or people to destinations in deep space. Now, let's turn to the rocket. Measuring 70m (230ft) -long, Super Heavy will be filled with cryogenic (chilled) methalox. It will be powered by around 33 Raptor engines (this specification has changed several times) and should achieve more than 70 Meganewtons (16 million lbs) of maximum thrust. It should be able to lift at least 100 tonnes of payload, and possibly as much as 150 tonnes, to low-Earth orbit. This will make Super Heavy more powerful than the immense Saturn V launcher used for the Apollo Moon missions in the 1960s and 70s. As it ascends from the launch pad, the combined Starship system will begin to pitch over towards the intended orbit.  When the upper stage separates in space, Super Heavy flips over while falling back towards Earth.  Steel structures called ""grid fins"" attached to the sides of the booster, will help steer the rocket stage back towards its launch pad so it can be flown again. SpaceX has an ambitious plan to then catch the falling booster using its launch tower. This tower provides engineers and crew members with access to the spacecraft and rocket while they are sitting on the pad before launch.  A pair of steel arms will extend out from the launch tower. The spent booster falls onto these arms. The tower has been dubbed ""Mechazilla"" because of its resemblance to a creature from the Godzilla movies. Meanwhile, the Starship upper stage could be inserted into a ""parking orbit"" after separation, allowing it to be re-filled with propellant. ""If you just fly [Starship] to orbit and don't do any refilling, it's pretty good â you'll get 150 tonnes to low-Earth orbit, and have no fuel to go anywhere else,"" Musk explained in 2017. ""If you send up tankers and re-fill in orbit, you could re-fill the tanks up all the way to the top, and get 150 tonnes [of payload] all the way to Mars."" To re-fuel, the spacecraft would dock with another Starship - already circling the Earth - that acts solely as a propellant depot. For long-haul trips to Mars and back - which could take up to nine months each way - Musk is looking to install around 40 cabins in the payload area near the front of the upper stage. ""You could conceivably have five or six people per cabin, if you really wanted to crowd people in. But I think mostly we would expect to see two or three people per cabin, and so nominally about 100 people per flight to Mars,"" Musk said. The payload bay would also host common areas, storage space, a galley and a shelter where people could gather to shield from solar storms, where the Sun belches out harmful charged particles into space. Starship will also play a key role in Nasa's Artemis programme, which aims to establish a long-term human presence on the Moon. In April 2021, the US space agency awarded SpaceX with a $2.89bn contract to develop Starship into a lander capable of delivering astronauts to the lunar surface this decade. The version tailored for Artemis flights would not possess the heat shield or flaps that are necessary for a return journey to Earth. Instead, the Starship Human Landing System would remain in space after its initial launch from Earth, so that it could eventually be used for multiple trips between lunar orbit and the Moon's surface. The uncrewed, or cargo, version of Starship features a payload bay that opens up like the mouth of a crocodile. This would allow it to be used for launching satellites. SpaceX says the huge payload capacity opens up possibilities for new types of robotic science mission, including telescopes larger than the James Webb observatory - the successor to Hubble which launched in December 2021. The system could also be used for space tourism: Elon Musk has promised a trip around the Moon in 2023 to the Japanese online retail billionaire Yusaku Maezawa. It could also carry out high-speed journeys between different destinations on Earth. Musk says that Starship could eventually carry people to destinations in the ""greater Solar System"", including gas giants such as Jupiter. But this remains a long-term objective. In order to bring other spacecraft back to the ground, engineers have relied on parachutes, or designed the vehicle so that it can land on a runway. But the Starship upper stage takes a different approach. When it is ready to land on Earth, the ship initially re-enters the atmosphere at a 60-degree angle and then ""belly-flops"" to the ground in the horizontal position. This mode of return relies entirely on the atmosphere to slow the vehicle's descent. The downside is that, in this configuration, Starship is inherently unstable. The vehicle therefore uses four steel landing flaps, positioned near the front and rear of the vehicle, to control its descent. This is much like a skydiver uses their arms and legs to control a free-fall. ""It's quite different from anything elseâ¦ we're doing a controlled fall,"" Elon Musk says.  ""You're trying to create drag rather than lift - it's really the opposite of an aircraft."" As Starship approaches the ground, it should be slow enough to execute an engine burn that flips the vehicle into a vertical position. It then uses the Raptors as retro-rockets to guide the vehicle down to a safe touchdown on its landing legs. Musk says this general approach could be used to bring Starship down safely on any planetary surface in the Solar System. Eventually, however, Starships returning to Earth - and perhaps other destinations - might not have to do the flip manoeuvre. The ships could instead be captured as they approach the ground by the launch tower's steel arms - just like the Super Heavy booster. Musk explained on Twitter: ""Ship will be caught by Mechazilla too. As with booster, no landing legs. Those are only needed for Moon and Mars until there is local infrastructure.""  In the last few years, SpaceX has tested various prototypes of the upper stage at its Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas. The company started off in 2019 with a 39m-tall ""test article"" called Starhopper - which bore a passing resemblance to a water tower - and flew it to 150m above ground. This video can not be played SN15 launched with improvements in its structures, avionics, software, and engines The first prototype to feature a nosecone and flaps - Starship serial number (SN8) - flew to an altitude of 12.5km in December 2020. It belly flopped back to Earth, giving SpaceX valuable engineering data about the final part of the vehicle's return from space. However, SN8 approached the landing pad a little too fast and hard, causing it to crumple and explode. Three more test articles exploded before Starship SN15 achieved success with a soft landing in May 2021. In February, SpaceX engineersconducted a key test on the rocket system, what's called a ""static fire"", simultaneously igniting 31 out of 33 of the engines at the base of the vehicle's lower-segment. The firing lasted only a few seconds, with everything clamped in place to prevent any movement. Mr Musk tweeted that the team had turned off one engine before the test and that another engine stopped itself, leaving 31 engines firing overall. But, he added, it was ""still enough engines to reach orbit"" The FAA granted a license that would allow SpaceX to perform a test flight for the rocket, which is scheduled for 17 April.  ""After a comprehensive license evaluation process, the FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental, policy, payload, airspace integration and financial responsibility requirements,"" the FAA said in a statement on Friday, adding that the license was valid for five years.

He said the company had not seen the increase in sales that had been expected in June, but added that July was a ""bit more promising"". Mr Musk sacked about half of Twitter's 7,500 staff when he took over in 2022 in an effort to cut costs.  Rival app Threads now has 150 million users, according to some estimates. Its in-built connection to Instagram automatically gives the Meta-designed platform access to a potential two billion users.  Meanwhile, Twitter is struggling under a heavy debt load. Cash flow remains negative, Mr Musk said at the weekend, although the billionaire did not put a time frame on the 50% drop in ad revenue. In a tweet he said: ""Need to reach positive cash flow before we have the luxury of anything else."" Lucy Coutts, investment director at JM Finn, told the BBC's Today programme she thought Mr Musk would be able to turn Twitter around ""but it is just going to take longer"". ""But unfortunately he has got $13bn of debt to pay by the end of July so we may see more pressure on the shares in Tesla if he has to sell more of his stake in that company."" Mr Musk is also the chief executive and majority shareholder of electric car-maker Tesla, which will report its latest quarterly financial results on Wednesday. After laying off thousands of employees and cutting cloud service bills, Mr Musk said Twitter was on track to post $3bn (Â£2.29bn) in revenue in 2023, down from $5.1bn in 2021. The development is the latest sign the aggressive cost-cutting measures have not been enough to ignite a return of advertisers who fled after changes to its content moderation rules. That is despite an interview Mr Musk gave to the BBC in April, in which he suggested that most had returned to the site. However, Meghana Dhar, the former head of partnerships at Snap and Meta, which owns the new Twitter rival Threads, said the company had been struggling prior to Mr Musk's buyout.  ""Elon and Twitter are in a candidly tough position right now,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. ""To be fair to Elon though, we've seen that decline in Twitter revenue and growth in revenue since pre-Elon - there's been kind of a steady decline.""  Linda Yaccarino, previously head of advertising at NBCUniversal, was taken on as chief executive of Twitter in June - a move suggesting advertising sales are still a priority for the company. Ms Yaccarino has said Twitter plans to focus on video, creator and commerce partnerships. It is said to be in early talks with political and entertainment figures, payments services, and news and media publishers. Why is Twitter limiting how many tweets you can see?

Elon Musk says old Twitter was an 'arm of ...",https://www.tweaktown.com/hubs/elon-musk/index.html,"Elon Reeve Musk, owner of X (Twitter), Tesla, SpaceX, and Dogecoin (LOL?) recently demands much attention, especially after taking over Twitter. Grok is the name of the AI from Elon Musk's xAI startup, and it aims to be a disruptor in the growing AI space by answering what other AI models reject. Elon Musk has explained what it was like to purchase Twitter and convert it into what is now known as X, a platform he says is more centered than Twitter. Elon Musk has teased on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast that the next Tesla Cybertruck event will feature multiple guns that will be fired at the vehicle. Elon Musk has explained what it will take for humans to terraform the Red Planet and how global warming will actually be a major goal. Elon Musk has appeared on the JRE Experience podcast and took a Cybertruck to the studio, where it was then shot with a compound bow. Elon Musk revealed during an X earnings call that the platform is heading toward incorporating a payment and banking system for its user base. X is officially going to roll out audio and video calling on the platform after X owner Elon Musk posted several teasers to his personal account. Monetization plans for X appear to be changing up another gear as Musk tells us that there'll be three subscription plans soon enough. During Tesla's Q3 earnings call, company CEO Elon Musk said that the company 'dug its own grave' with Cybertruck, but it's unsurprising. Tesla's new Cybertruck will be delivered to select customers starting November 30, before going into full production next year at its Texas Gigafactory. EU Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton posted a letter addressed to Elon Musk warning him of what will come if X continues hosting. X, formerly known as Twitter, has now officially stopped showing headlines on news links after an update was rolled out that came straight from Elon Musk. Elon Musk has given an estimation for when SpaceX will be able to land the world's most powerful and largest rocket, Starship, will land on the Red Planet. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has accepted an award at the 74th International Astronautical Congress and discussed the possibility of life outside of Earth. X has rolled out an update that removes headlines from posted links on its platform, with some users reporting they began to notice the change today. Elon Musk has announced the world's most powerful rocket, Starship, is ready for its second orbital test flight as it sits fully stacked at Starbase. SpaceX experienced the rath of a fully fired-up Elon Musk when the company CEO went 'demon-mode' on employees, pushing them to stack Starship. Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of Elon Musk's social media platform, formerly called Twitter, has recently revealed when the platform will be profitable. Elon Musk's X social network continues to work on video and audio calling and it's now closer than ever to happening according to a new leak. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro are both now here and X owner Elon Musk says that he's already planning on picking one of them up. A new investigation by a publication has revealed Elon Musk's claims that his brain chip company isn't killing monkeys may not be entirely true. Elon Musk's brain-chip company Neuralink has received approval from a review board to recruit the first patients for clinical human trials. Elon Musk has announced a new feature for Twitter, or X users, with individuals now having the option of removing their likes tab. Elon Musk has congratulated the SpaceX team on completing 57 corrective actions issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). After discovering a nearly half a billion short position against Tesla, Microsoft founder Bill Gates said Elon Musk was 'super mean to me'. Elon Musk has taken to X to further explain the situation with SpaceX's Starlink satellites not being used by Ukraine to attack Russia. Elon Musk has been caught up in a debate regarding his decision to turn off Starlink's internet access during an offensive attack by Ukraine on Russia. Elon Musk has confirmed SpaceX's Starship launch vehicle is ready for its second orbital launch attempt, but the company is waiting for one thing to pass. Video and voice calls are coming to the X social network, owner and former CEO Elon Musk has said in a post that promises a 'unique' experience. Elon Musk decided to test livestreaming on X while driving through Palo Alto, an illegal activity that won't end up in Musk getting a fine. Elon Musk was on-screen for all of 4 seconds and was immediately booed by a Valorant crowd that began chanting, 'bring back Twitter'. Elon Musk has admitted in a new X post that the social media platform has the potential to 'fail' under his command, but 'we will try our best.' Elon Musk has started laughing at people complaining about the block feature on X being removed amid concern it would result in the app being pulled. Elon Musk wants to remove a key feature from X that may result in the social media app being pulled from the App Store and Google Play Store. A New York University professor claimed Elon Musk locked him out of his X account after he refused to meet up with him to settle a dispute. Renowned publications are reporting that Elon Musk is choosing to purposely throttle website links on X, but only for websites he doesn't like. X owner Elon Musk has rolled out a Pro version of X that simultaneously puts a paywall in front of a very popular feature on the social media platform. The cage fight between Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk has reached new heights of insanity after Musk said he's going to rock up at Zuckerberg's house. Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have been texting, and the Meta CEO has given the Tesla CEO an ultimatum over their anticipated cage fight. Elon Musk has said he's currently in talks with a government about securing an 'epic location' for his fight with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The cage match between Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and X owner Elon Musk may turn into a debate about how to build a safe future for all of humanity. Elon Musk has rolled out 'sensitivity settings' that will enable advertisers to align their brand's messaging or advertising with content on the platform. Elon Musk has announced that he's getting an MRI to determine the cause of health problems that may require surgery before the fight with Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg has called out Elon Musk by responding to his claim their cage fight will be live-streamed on X, 'Not holding my breath.' After saying where the fight will be live-streamed, Elon Musk has breathed life back into the highly anticipated cage fight with Mark Zuckerberg. Elon Musk has announced on his X account that Tesla has figured out some aspects of artificial general intelligence, 'the car has a mind.' SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has given an update on when we can expect Starship to hit the skies and the chances of it reaching orbital velocity. Elon Musk has responded to the recent report that claimed X has put out a call for a financial-data giant to build a trading hub within its app. The non-profit sued by X owner Elon Musk has posted a new response calling Musk's latest legal move is 'straight out of the authoritarian playbook'. Elon Musk has asked X users to subscribe to as many creators as they can afford while saying that he will try to reduce App Store Tax. Changes to X's API looks to have caused another major player to remove integrated support for the social media platform - PlayStation. It's another stacked episode of The TT Show with the duo covering Alan Wake 2's PC requirements, new SUPER GPUs from NVIDIA, the Cybertruck, and more. SpaceX has fired up one of the engines powering the world's largest and most powerful rocket, Starship, ahead of its second orbital test flight. X has announced it will be rolling out a new paywall aimed at users creating new X accounts, which will require them to pay $1 for basic features. SpaceX has released an update on the company's actions to mitigate the failures Starship sustained during its first orbital flight test. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has demanded that Tesla hand over data about 'Elon' mode, which enables prolonged hands-free driving. Elon Musk has confirmed X will be getting an update that decapitates news on the platform, as he believes it will improve the platform's aesthetics. Reports indicate that SpaceX has liquidated its entire Bitcoin position in an epic sell-off worth $373 million amid a tectonic market crash. © 1999-2023 Tweak Town Pty Ltd. All Rights Reserved.

""Sorry for turning Twitter from ...",https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64989720,"I had just finished my investigation into whether Twitter can protect users under Elon Musk's ownership, when - to my surprise - the man himself tweeted about it. ""Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that hasâ¦ trolls,"" he said in one tweet, posting a screengrab of the report.  According to Twitter's own data, that tweet was seen by more than 30 million profiles. ""Trolls are kinda fun,"" Mr Musk said in another reply, in his response to my BBC investigation - Twitter insiders: We can't protect users from trolling under Musk. The investigation made clear Twitter was never perfect. But it had exposed how hate is thriving under Twitter's new owner. Current and former Twitter employees told me ""nobody is taking care of"" features designed to protect users from hate and harm. I had approached Elon Musk as part of my Panorama investigation, but he didn't respond.  Instead, he decided to share his reaction to it afterwards with more than 130 million followers on his social media site. His tweets then unleashed a torrent of abuse against me from other users.  There have been hundreds of posts, many including misogynistic slurs and abusive language. There have also been threatening messages, including depictions of kidnap and hanging. Mr Musk posted again, responding to one tweet that was critical of the BBC investigation. He wrote ""roflmao"" - ""rolling on the floor laughing my ass off."" I now found myself wading through more hateful messages sent from accounts predominantly based in the US and UK. Mr Musk's tweets triggered a huge volume of hate, some sent from accounts which had previously been suspended. More proof to back up BBC Panorama's investigation - that hate on Twitter is thriving. The majority of hateful messages were directed at me. Abuse on Twitter is nothing new for me. After all, I'm a reporter who shares my coverage of disinformation, conspiracies and hate there. For my initial investigation, a team from the International Center for Journalists and the University of Sheffield tracked the hate I had received and revealed it had tripled since Elon Musk's takeover, compared to the same period the previous year. Behind The Stories Disinformation Correspondent Marianna Spring talks about reporting on trolls, online abuse and Elon Musk. Watch on BBC iPlayer now (UK Only) Elon Musk's Twitter Storm Marianna Spring investigates how Elon Musk's ownership is transforming one of the world's most influential social media platforms. Watch Elon Musk's Twitter Storm on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) In the wake of Mr Musk's tweets about me, the International Center for Journalists and the University of Sheffield confirmed that the hate had increased again - to the highest levels in the past year. And the tools the team used could not even pick up all the abuse. Some of it didn't use my name directly or was in response to Mr Musk's original tweet, which attracted more than 14,000 replies.  Others were private messages - which included a video of a woman being tied up and held at gunpoint, and another showing hangings. There were also some which included talking about my time ending ""in a horrible way"" and wanting me to ""burn in hell"". Many combined misogynistic slurs with abusive and sexualised language. I was repeatedly called a bitch and much nastier insults. Most of the messages were received on Twitter, with a small number sent to me on other sites following Mr Musk's tweets. During my original investigation, I had looked into profiles sending out abuse on Twitter. Many had become more active on the social media site since Elon Musk decided to restore thousands of suspended accounts. This time, I looked into the accounts sending me abuse. Many of the accounts had become more active since the takeover, and several openly rejoiced how their profiles had returned since Mr Musk bought the platform. Some were prominent conspiracy theorists brought back by Mr Musk. Several had the new paid-for blue ""verified"" ticks. Whenever I've been on the receiving end of a deluge of hate in the past year, I've used social media features to protect myself. This time around, those tools on Twitter didn't appear to be working the same way.  Safety mode, which automatically blocks abusive accounts, was blocking some accounts sharing hate - but it was also, in error, blocking users who were posting supportively. This matches up with what current and former employees at Twitter told me about how features - like the ""harmful reply nudge"", intended to protect Twitter users from trolling and harassment - are proving difficult to maintain and are working inconsistently.  At least half of Twitter's workforce have been sacked or chosen to leave since Mr Musk bought it. When I went back to those insiders to ask what they thought about the new wave of online abuse, several said it further confirmed concerns they had raised about Twitter under Mr Musk. I have approached Elon Musk and Twitter several times to ask about his vision for the social media site. I've been in touch with both Twitter and Mr Musk again to seek their response to the additional spike in hate I've received since his tweets. They have not responded.  Since then, the email account for the Twitter press office now automatically sends out poo emojis in response to requests. Twitter policies, which are publicly available online, say that ""defending and respecting the user's voice"" remains one of its ""core values"". This latest episode raises questions about what freedom of expression really means on the new Twitter, where trolling seems to be fair game and even journalists looking to hold the social media platform to account become the targets.

144,"Elon Musk: Social media platform X, formerly Twitter, could go behind paywall",BBC,2023-09-19,"Elon Musk has suggested that all users of X, formerly called Twitter, may have to pay for access to the platform. In a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the billionaire ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66850821,"Elon Musk has suggested that all users of X, formerly called Twitter, may have to pay for access to the platform. In a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the billionaire said a payment system was the only way to counter bots. ""We're moving to having a small monthly payment for use of the system,"" the Tesla and SpaceX boss said. The BBC approached X for further details but has not yet received a statement from the company. It is unclear whether this was just an off-the-cuff comment, or a signal of firmer plans that have yet to be announced. Mr Musk has long said that his solution for getting rid of bots and fake accounts on the social media platform is charging for verification. Since taking over Twitter last year he has looked to incentivise users to pay for an enhanced service, which is now called X Premium. This has been done by giving paid subscribers more features, like longer posts and increased visibility on the platform.  However, users can currently still use X for free. Although there is a clear financial interest for the company to charge users, Mr Musk insisted that getting people to pay for the service is aimed at tackling bots. ""A bot costs a fraction of a penny"" to make he said. ""But if somebody even has to pay a few dollars or something, some minor amount, the effective cost to bots is very high"". X Premium currently costs $8 (Â£6.50) a month in the US. The price differs depending on which country a subscriber is in. The world's richest person said that he was now looking at cheaper options for users. ""We're actually going to come up with a lower tier pricing. So we just want it to be just a small amount of money,"" he said. ""This is a longer discussion, but in my view, this is actually the only defence against vast armies of bots,"" Mr Musk added. However, a risk is that by putting X behind a paywall it may lose a large chunk of its users. That in turn, could drive down advertising revenue, which currently accounts for the vast majority of the company's income. Mr Musk's conversation with the Israeli prime minister also touched on antisemitism on X. The platform has been accused by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) campaign group of not doing enough to stop antisemitic content. In a statement, the organisation said that Mr Musk was ""engaging with and elevating"" antisemites. Earlier this month, he said that the company would sue the ADL to ""clear our platform's name"". In the conversation with Mr Netanyahu, Mr Musk reiterated that he was ""against antisemitism"". Mr Netanyahu accepted the balance between free speech and content moderation was a challenge but urged Mr Musk to get the balance right. ""I hope you find within the confines of the First Amendment, the ability to stop not only antisemitism... but any collective hatred of people that antisemitism represents,"" he said. ""I know you're committed to that"", Mr Netanyahu added. This video can not be played Watch: Musk takes son to meet Turkish President Erdogan Musk takes son to meet Turkey's President Erdogan.

146,Elon Musk: What it's like to interview the billionaire Twitter boss,BBC,2023-04-12,"Over the weekend I decided to drop Elon Musk an email.

He'd just added a label on Twitter to a BBC account saying ""government funded media"". I thought I'd send him a link to how the BBC is funded - predominantly through the licence fee. ""Is the Twitter label accurate?"" was the response I got which came from Mr Musk, rather than a media team.  My editor suggested I have a bash at asking for an interview. Why not have a go, we thought. On Tuesday lunchtime I typed an email, requesting a chat about his first six months as Twitter boss. To my surprise, he responded.  ""Sure, how about tonight?"" he said. I wasn't totally sure if he was being serious. I prepped for the interview, hoping it would happen - but wondering if it actually would. The curveball came just before the interview - when Elon Musk's team insisted the interview should be live on Twitter Spaces.  We responded saying if Twitter Spaces was going to be live, then we'll put it on the BBC channel too. ""Cool,"" he said.  According to his team, more than 3 million people logged in to listen on Twitter Spaces.  Straight off the bat, it was clear he was going to answer my questions. ""Did you buy Twitter because a court was going to force you to?"" I asked.  He replied: ""Yeah, yeah I did"". It was a startlingly frank answer - which set the tone for the interview.  A court may have forced Mr Musk to buy Twitter, because he made an offer for the social media platform then backed out of the deal.  The previous owners and Elon Musk were set to face off in court but before that happened, the billionaire made a surprise U-Turn and bought the platform.  It's the first time Mr Musk has admitted that, even when he walked into Twitter with that sink - all in smiles - he didn't really want it to happen. He'd rather have not bought the company.  Since he has taken over Twitter, he has laid off large swathes of his workforce and made what many see as unorthodox business decisions including introducing paid-for-verification. Many also say Twitter has become a more dangerous platform for users without enough appropriate moderation. The billionaire loves chaos and messing with the media. Several times it felt like he was trying to interview me.  Asking him whether Twitter had become a more hateful place, Mr Musk pushed me to try and name specific examples I'd seen. He was enjoying it at this point. The BBC has previously documented that misinformation is a problem on the platform, yet Mr Musk disagreed.  I pointed out that you can't have it both ways - a platform that allows people to post what they wish without being censored, surely also disseminates misinformation?  But Mr Musk claimed reducing bots, which he says he is doing, will reduce misinformation. This felt like his weakest answer.   This video can not be played Watch: Elon Musk's unexpected BBC interview... in 90 seconds We covered all sorts of subjects: from misinformation and the challenges of artificial intelligence to his love life and whether it was lonely to be a billionaire. He told me he'd often be swarmed by men at parties talking about projects - and that it was hard to trust people.  His answers were also, at times, absurd. In one moment he told me his dog runs the company. While he wriggled out of some questions, there were many questions he took the time to consider.  For example, when I asked him whether he believed TikTok should be banned. He told me that while that would be good for Twitter - one less competitor - he was generally against banning things.  I was expecting at the end of the interview for him to leave as I asked him for ""one more question"", but he did nothing of the sort. The interview, initially slated to be 30 minutes, ended up running for about 90 minutes. At the end he said his goodbyes and went to his office to work. ""I usually go to sleep between 3am and 6am,"" he said.  As he disappeared we reflected on a whirlwind of an interview - and how none of this would have happened if I hadn't sent that email.

147,Elon Musk: Tesla boss on first China trip in over three years,BBC,2023-05-31,"Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is in China, as he makes his first trip to the world's second largest economy in over three years. He arrived in Beijing on Tuesday and is also expected to visit ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65762114?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is in China, as he makes his first trip to the world's second largest economy in over three years. He arrived in Beijing on Tuesday and is also expected to visit Tesla's huge manufacturing plant in Shanghai. The multi-billionaire met China's foreign minister Qin Gang within hours of arriving in the country. Mr Musk has not yet publicly commented on the trip, which comes amid tensions between the US and China. He also declined to make any comments about his plans for the trip when asked by reporters as he left a hotel in Beijing on Wednesday. Later on Wednesday, Mr Musk met China's industry minister Jin Zhuanglong and discussed the development of electric vehicles. In a statement on Tuesday, China's foreign ministry said that Mr Musk was willing to expand the car maker's business in the country, which is Tesla's biggest market after the US. The ministry added that during the meeting Mr Musk had described the economies of the US and China as ""conjoined twins"". Tesla did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. Mr Musk has also been uncharacteristically quiet on Twitter, which he owns and where he has more than 141 million followers. He is known for tweeting many times a day but as of midday on Wednesday had not posted anything since arriving in the country on Tuesday afternoon.  The social media platform is banned in China but it can be accessed through VPNs, or Virtual Private Networks. Mr Musk is the latest high-profile US executive to make a trip to China. JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon is also in China this week, while Apple boss Tim Cook visited the country in March. However, as tensions rise between Washington and Beijing Tesla finds itself in a difficult position, Dan Ives from investment firm Wedbush Securities said. ""Playing nice in the sandbox in Beijing is something Wall Street is laser focused on, to make sure there are no disruptions to Tesla's expansion within China for the coming years,"" Mr Ives added. In January 2019, Tesla started building its so-called gigafactory in Shanghai, which was the firm's first manufacturing plant outside the US. Later that year, it delivered its first Chinese-made cars, marking a major milestone for the American company. However, Covid lockdowns across the country, including in the financial, manufacturing and shipping hub of Shanghai, made it increasingly difficult for manufacturers to operate. Last year, Mr Musk said the coronavirus lockdown of Shanghai was ""very, very difficult"" for Tesla, which reportedly halted most of its production at its gigafactory for several weeks. Operations have since resumed at the plant, which produced its millionth car in August, according to Mr Musk. This accounted for a third of Tesla's global production. Last month, the company said it planned to build a new factory in China to make its large-scale ""Megapack"" batteries. China has also become the largest market for Tesla's Model Y mass-market electric vehicle, according to market research firm JATO. More than 94,000 Model Y vehicles were sold in China in the first three months of this year, putting it ahead of the US and Europe, JATO data shows. In recent years, Tesla's lead in electric vehicle market has been challenged by increased competition from car making giants, including Ford and General Motors, as well as newer entrants into the market like China's BYD and Nio. Mr Musk - who bought Twitter last year for $44bn (Â£35.5bn) - has been under pressure to find someone else to lead the company and refocus his attention on his other businesses, including Tesla and rocket firm SpaceX. Earlier this month, he named Linda Yaccarino, the former head of advertising at NBCUniversal as the platform's new chief executive. Ms Yaccarino will face the challenge of running a business that has struggled to be profitable, while facing intense scrutiny over how it handles misinformation and hate speech. Twitter is now worth around a third of what Mr Musk paid for it, according to financial services firm Fidelity Investments, which helped to finance his takeover of the company.

 The change, first hinted at on Sunday, has rattled many users of the social media site. This bird has flown. Mere hours after hinting at a logo design change, Elon Musk has gone through with his promise. People refreshed Twitter on Monday to find the iconic blue bird replaced with a black-and-white X as the platform's new official logo. No frills or fancy designs for the social media site, just a minimalist X that has rattled many users and left them with questions: Is this a marketing stunt? Will Musk keep the term tweets or replace it?     Musk first hinted at the change with a series of tweets – x’s? – posted Sunday. ""And soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,"" Musk wrote in a tweet early Sunday, before writing “X.com now points to https://twitter.com/. Interim X logo goes live later today.” Musk also hinted at changing the platform’s color to black. On Monday,  shortly after he posted a picture showing the X logo projected on the company’s headquarters, the logo took over the website. When asked about the future of ""retweets,"" Musk replied that the ""whole concept should be rethought."" What that means is unclear. Twitter’s new CEO Linda Yaccarino talked about the rebranding in a thread posted Sunday evening, saying X will be the platform that can deliver “everything.” “X is the future state of unlimited interactivity — centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking — creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities,"" Yaccarino wrote. “Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.” This change is the latest controversial decision Musk has made since he acquired the company in October 2022, along with a drastic reshuffling of the company’s administration and several changes to the platform’s features.

In a tweet to the firm's chief executive, Halli Thorleifsson said: ""Your head of HR is not able to confirm if I am employed or not"". Mr Musk responded by asking: ""What work have you been doing?"" Mr Thorleifsson told the BBC that nine days after being frozen out of Twitter's accounts he did not know whether he had been fired or not. After a series of follow up questions and answers with Mr Musk, that read like a live interview for his job, Mr Thorleifsson said he received an email confirming that he had been sacked. Twitter did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. Mr Thorleifsson, 45, was a senior director in product design for Twitter. He told the BBC the ambiguity around his job was ""strange"" and ""extremely stressful"". ""I opened my computer on Sunday morning nine days ago and saw that the screen was grey and locked, indicating that I had been locked out of my Twitter accounts"", he said. ""After a few days had passed I started reaching out to people, including Elon and the head of HR to ask about my situation. ""The head of HR has since twice emailed me and has not been able to answer whether or not I am an employee at Twitter.""  Frustrated, he tweeted his top boss, Elon Musk. Allow Twitter content?

Shortly after that exchange Mr Thorleifsson said that Twitter's Human Resources department had contacted him and said that he had been fired.  The exchange was widely shared on Twitter, with Mr Musk wading in with some replies.  He went on to further criticise Mr Thorleifsson saying: ""The reality is that this guy (who is independently wealthy) did no actual work, claimed as his excuse that he had a disability that prevented him from typing, yet was simultaneously tweeting up a storm.  ""Can't say I have a lot of respect for that."" The Iceland-based entrepreneur had sold his company, Ueno, a creative design agency, to Twitter in early 2021 - after founding the firm in Reykjavik in 2014.  As part of the acquisition he became a full-time employee at Twitter. ""I decided to sell for a few reasons but one of them is that I have muscular dystrophy and my body is slowly but surely failing me,"" he told the BBC.  ""I have a few good work years left in me so this was a way to wrap up my company, and set up myself and my family for years when I won't be able to do as much.""  Mr Thorleifsson is worried that Mr Musk will not honour the contract he signed with Twitter when he sold them his company.  ""This is extremely stressful. This is my retirement fund, a way to take care of myself and my family as my disease progresses. Having the richest man in the world on the other end of this, potentially refusing to stand by contracts is not easy for me to accept,"" he said.  Last month, Elon Musk appeared to fire another 200 Twitter employees. It means that Twitter now has just over 2,000 workers - down from approximately 7,500 in October.  ""Companies let people go, that's within their rights,"" Mr Thorleifsson said. ""They usually tell people about it but that's seemingly the optional part at Twitter now"".

150,Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg agree to hold cage fight,BBC,2023-09-26,Two of the world's most high-profile technology billionaires - Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg - have agreed to fight each other in a cage match. Mr Musk posted a message on his social media ...,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65981876,"Two of the world's most high-profile technology billionaires - Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg - have agreed to fight each other in a cage match. Mr Musk posted a message on his social media platform Twitter that he was ""up for a cage fight"" with Mr Zuckerberg. Mr Zuckerberg, the boss of Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta, then posted a screenshot of Mr Musk's tweet with the caption ""send me location"". ""The story speaks for itself,"" a Meta spokesperson told the BBC. Mr Musk then replied to Mr Zuckerberg's response with: ""Vegas Octagon."" The Octagon is the competition mat and fenced-in area used for Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) bouts. The UFC is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mr Musk, who turns 52 later this month, also tweeted: ""I have this great move that I call 'The Walrus', where I just lie on top of my opponent & do nothing."" He later tweeted short videos of walruses, perhaps suggesting his challenge to Mr Zuckerberg may not entirely be serious. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He also tweeted: ""I almost never work out, except for picking up my kids & throwing them in the air."" Meanwhile, 39-year-old Mr Zuckerberg has already been training in mixed martial arts (MMA) and has recently won jiu-jitsu tournaments. Twitter did not provide a statement when contacted by the BBC for comment. The exchanges have gone viral with social media users debating who would win the bout, while others have posted memes including mocked up posters advertising the fight. For example, business consultant Seyi Taylor tweeted: ""Choose your fighter"" with pictures of the two tech bosses. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Broadcaster and fight sports journalist Nick Peet told the BBC's World at One programme that Dana White, the president of the UFC, would be ""licking his lips at the possibility of putting this fight on"". He said he thought there was a decent chance it could actually go ahead, ""mostly because of Elon Musk and his personality and his eccentric character. His career kind of suggests he's not somebody who willingly steps down."" However, asked who he thought would come out on top, he replied: ""Zuckerberg all day! He's 12 years younger. He is a lot smaller. I think he's 5ft 7, Elon's probably around 6ft. And Elon's probably got a couple of stone in weight on him.  ""But unfortunately Mr Musk has got no training whatsoever. Even though Zuckerberg's only been training Brazilian jiu-jitsu for 18 months, it wouldn't be difficult for him to take his back, wrap his arms around his neck and give him a good old cuddle and choke him out!"" Mr Musk has a history of making statements that are not serious or which fail to happen. For example, he told the BBC in April he had made his dog chief executive of Twitter. In 2017 he tweeted he had ""verbal government approval"" for a so-called hyperloop - a kind of train system - to connect New York City with Washington DC, Philadephia and Baltimore. This has yet to materialise. In 2018 Mr Musk was forced to step down as Tesla chair by regulators after Tweeting that he intended to take the firm private. Mr Musk has also made good on some of his pronouncements, including stepping down as Twitter chief executive this year after Twitter users voted in favour of his resignation in a poll he ran. He had already said he wanted to step back as chief executive in November 2022, however. Earlier this month, Meta showed staff plans for a text-based social network designed to compete with Twitter, sources told the BBC. It could allow users to follow accounts they already follow on Instagram, Meta's image-sharing app. It could potentially allow the company to bring over followers from decentralised platforms such as Mastodon. A Meta spokesperson confirmed to the BBC that the platform was in development. The text-based network - which has a working title of P92 - could turn out to be a greater rival to Elon Musk's Twitter than either BlueSky or Mastodon.

On September 29, the Canadian star (real name Claire Elise Boucher), filed a ""petition to establish parental relationship"" in a California court, records obtained by Page Six show. Details into the Tesla founder and the ""Oblivion"" singer's relationship have always been murky – as has information on their kids, the existence of the third having only recently been revealed – and the new plea doesn't give much more insight. Grimes and Elon have been in an on-and-off relationship since 2018, and in her new legal filing, the mom-of-three isn't broaching the topic of custody or child support just yet, but rather is seeking to have a court establish who the legal parents of her three kids are. Below, read more about Elon and Grimes' elusive, and seemingly contentious relationship. It's not often that the two have made it clear whether they are together or not, but as of October 2023, it appears to be the latter. Last month, author Walter Isaacson – who has been following Elon for three years for his new biography on him, titled Elon Musk – shared a photo of the Space X founder pictured for the first time with his twins with venture capitalist Shivon Zilis, Strider and Azure, then 16 months old. In response, Grimes wrote in a since-deleted tweet: ""Tell Shivon to unblock me and tell Elon to let me see my son or plz respond to my lawyer,"" adding: ""I have never even been allowed to see a photo of these children until this moment, despite the situation utterly ripping my family apart."" Days later, she took to X, formerly known as Twitter, again, and shared: ""I spoke with Shivon at length finally, which was long overdue. This wasn't her fault, plz don't be angry at her!"" Elon and Grimes welcomed their first child, a son (controversially) named X Æ A-Xii, back in May 2020. Though they first broke up in September 2021, they then welcomed daughter Exa Dark Sideræl, also referred to as Y, via surrogate in December 2021. Finally, Elon's biographer revealed earlier this month for the first time that the two had actually welcomed a third child, another son named Techno Mechanicus (nicknamed Tau), though it's unclear when he was born. Elon has welcomed 11 kids; he has been married and divorced three times, twice with actress Talulah Riley.  He first welcomed son Nevada Alexander Musk in 2002 with his ex-wife Justine Wilson, however he passed from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) when he was 10 weeks old. Elon and Justine then welcomed twins Griffin and Vivian, 18, in April 2004, and triplets Kai, Saxon and Damian, 16, in 2006. Vivian, who came out as transgender in June 2022, is estranged from her father and goes by her mother's last name. Elon and Justin divorced in 2008. Beyond his five kids with his ex-wife, the remaining five are his three kids with Grimes and his twins with Shivon, who were born in November 2021, however their identity wasn't revealed until almost a year later.

152,Taiwan tells Elon Musk it is 'not for sale',BBC,2023-09-16,"Taiwan has told billionaire Elon Musk it is ""not for sale"" after he said the island was a part of China. ""Listen up, Taiwan is not part of the PRC [People's Republic of China] & certainly not for ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-66816507,"Taiwan has told billionaire Elon Musk it is ""not for sale"" after he said the island was a part of China. ""Listen up, Taiwan is not part of the PRC [People's Republic of China] & certainly not for sale!,"" foreign minister Joseph Wu said on Mr Musk's X. At a business summit this week, Mr Musk compared Taiwan to Hawaii, calling it an ""integral part"" of China. Beijing claims self-governed Taiwan and tensions between the two have ratcheted up over the past year.  Just this week, China conducted air and naval drills around Taiwan, in what has become a routine show of military might around the island. Taiwan said that it had detected more than 40 Chinese military aircraft and about 10 ships in its waters. This is not the first time that Mr Musk, who has business interests in China, has angered Taiwan's government with his comments. In October, he suggested that tensions between Beijing and Taipei could be resolved by giving China some control over Taiwan.  He said then in an interview with the Financial Times that he believed the two governments could reach a ""reasonably palatable"" arrangement. China's ambassador to the US had praised Mr Musk but his Taiwanese counterpart said something similar to Mr Wu - that freedom is ""not for sale"". Mr Wu also posted on X: ""Hope Elon Musk can also ask the CCP [Chinese Community Party] to open X to its people."" Mr Musk's micro-blogging platform X, formerly known as Twitter, is banned in China. Mr Wu had previously said that China's military drills were intended to influence Taiwan's elections in January. ""The PRC [People's Republic of China] has made it clear it wants to shape Taiwan's coming national election. Well, it's up to our citizens to decide, not the bully next door,"" he wrote on X. Mr Musk's electric car maker Tesla has a large manufacturing plant in Shanghai and he most recently visited the country in May. He met top Chinese officials and the Chinese foreign ministry said that Tesla was willing to expand its business in the country.   His visit drew much attention given relations between China and the US have plummeted in recent years. Despite resuming high-level dialogue, the two countries still disagree on a range of issues, including Taiwan, which has emerged as one of the biggest flashpoints between them.

153,"Elon Musk woos world leaders, courting controversy",BBC,2023-09-26,"A parade of foreign leaders on recent US trips, including on official state visits at the White House's invitation, have added sit-downs with Elon Musk to their schedules. This year, the world's ...",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66777096,"He is ""very impressed"" with Emmanuel Macron. Narendra Modi can count him as ""a fan"". And Benjamin Netanyahu just dropped in to see him. A parade of foreign leaders on recent US trips, including on official state visits at the White House's invitation, have added sit-downs with Elon Musk to their schedules. This year, the world's richest man has met with, to name a few, the heads of France, Italy, India, South Korea - and, in just the past two days, Turkey and Israel. Yet while the mercurial billionaire is more highly sought after than ever, there is no love lost between him and the Biden administration. And as the outspoken contrarian's political reach expands, including by wading into sensitive geopolitical issues, there is growing unease for some over Mr Musk's power and access.   Some foreign leaders are seeking an economic and electric vehicle industry boost from a new Tesla factory or an infrastructure investment from SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet services. Others have discussed X, the Musk-owned platform formerly known as Twitter, and the future of artificial intelligence. French President Macron has courted the tech mogul three times since December, a charm offensive driven by the desire for a new Tesla gigafactory in his country. Similar entreaties have come from Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in June and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan this past Sunday in New York. And though Mr Musk had just been in New York ahead of this week's United Nations General Assembly, Israeli PM Netanyahu flew to California for an AI conversation with him on Monday. The latter discussion took place against the backdrop of Mr Musk's simmering feud with the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish civil rights organisation. The ADL and other groups have released findings that suggest hate speech has grown dramatically on X since he bought the site last year and changed its moderation rules. Mr Netanyahu - who has previously tweeted admiration for Mr Musk's ""genius & impact on humanity"" - encouraged him in their live-streamed conversation on Monday to ""find the balance"" between protecting free speech and punishing hate speech. It was not the first time he has had to answer for concerns with X since he took over. His sit-down with Indian PM Modi in June came on the heels of ex-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's allegation that the Indian government had threatened to shut down the site if it did not comply with orders to take down content. Those in the pre-Musk era of the company had largely pushed back against such demands, but Mr Musk said he could not do so. ""If we don't obey local government laws, we will get shut down so the best we can do is to hew close to the law in any given country, but it is impossible for us to do more than that or we'll be blocked and our people will be arrested,"" he told reporters after the Modi meeting. While many of these meetings have ostensibly focused on Mr Musk's significant business interests, they come as he wields - and increasingly asserts - influence over global geopolitics. Recent statements from the South African-born US citizen have been interpreted in some corners as an affront to US interests, as well as those of the broader global West. Last week, he left Taiwanese officials fuming with apparently offhand comments on Beijing's 'One-China' policy, suggesting the self-governed island is ""analogous to like Hawaii or something like that, an integral part of China that is arbitrarily not part of China"". Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu shot back on X: ""Listen up, Taiwan is not part of the PRC & certainly not for sale!"" The spat gave fuel to claims by Musk critics that he is quick to acquiesce to the demands of other countries, even when they are US adversaries. ""Hope Elon Musk can also ask the CCP to open X to its people,"" Mr Wu wrote. ""Perhaps he thinks banning it is a good policy, like turning off Starlink to thwart Ukraine's counterstrike against Russia."" The Starlink claim - that the entrepreneur ""secretly told his engineers to turn off coverage"" to prevent a Ukrainian sneak attack on the Russian naval fleet in Crimea - concerned US allies. But amid strong pushback from Mr Musk, author Walter Isaacson began walking back the claim as his book was hitting shelves, writing on X that Starlink coverage up to Crimea was never in fact enabled. Neither Mr Isaacson nor Mr Musk responded to requests for comment from the BBC. The Isaacson book, however, claims elsewhere that, before Mr Musk made his decision, Russia's ambassador to the US ""explicitly told him that a Ukrainian attack on Crimea would lead to a nuclear response"". And after he tweeted out a peace proposal last year that led one Ukrainian official to question whether he had ""been hacked by Russians"", political scientist Ian Bremmer dropped a bombshell on X. ""elon musk told me he had spoken with putin and the kremlin directly about ukraine. he also told me what the kremlin's red lines were,"" he wrote. Mr Musk denied the allegation, but Mr Bremmer doubled down: ""i've long admired musk as a unique and world-changing entrepreneur, which i've said publicly. he's not a geopolitics expert."" The next month, when asked if Mr Musk was a threat to US national security, President Biden replied that his ""cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at"". That is the tip of the iceberg in a frosty relationship - the White House tends to avoid mention of Tesla in its public comments on the electric vehicle industry, talking instead about unionised car-makers, while Mr Musk tangles online with top Democrats, says he can ""no longer support"" the party and flirts with Republican presidential challengers. Ashlee Vance, a Musk biographer who has covered him for more than a decade, argues that Mr Musk has been feeling frustrated and under-appreciated. ""This is a guy who likes to get a lot of [expletive] done, he thinks he's right, and he never likes things getting in his way,"" Mr Vance told the BBC. ""He was already this material wildcard, [the Biden administration] poured gasoline on the fire and they now have zero goodwill with which to try to rein him in."" The runaway success of Tesla and SpaceX have helped transform Mr Musk from genius innovator to celebrity icon. ""In the span of about 25 years, you could argue he has accomplished more than any other human being,"" said Mr Vance. ""He stands out in history of doing this across different industries on an unparalleled scale."" This video can not be played Watch: Musk takes son to meet Turkish President Erdogan But Mr Musk's growing wealth and political evolution over the past few years has also dovetailed with a more divisive and polarising public image, driven in part by his always-online, troll-happy persona on X. ""He's always been this guy who was very sure of his opinions on things and not afraid to express them,"" Mr Vance said. ""He used to play both sides to benefit his companies. He was pretty methodical, didn't talk about politics too much and, anytime he was talking about politics, it was around an issue like climate change."" Since 2017 or 2018, however, the billionaire has begun to caricature his public persona, he says. ""He says whatever comes to his mind. He's alienating people for no reason. He's sort of undermining himself at a time when his companies are actually doing really well."" ""In person, he's actually not the Twitter character at all,"" Mr Vance continued. ""Over time, he's become more sociable, he's extremely rational and interesting, and he's a very different person.""  Noam Cohen, a former New York Times tech columnist and author of The Know-It-Alls: The Rise of Silicon Valley as a Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ball, takes a slightly different view. He believes that Mr Musk's singular ambition and vision have made him an over-achiever in business as well as a ""quasi-governmental"" force. In his telling, Mr Musk has combined ""the physical"" - large factories, lots of employees and valuable products - with ""the digital"" - control over how information spreads. And no other tech titan, whether like Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos, has matched that, according to Mr Cohen. This video can not be played Watch: 'Overwhelming consensus' to regulate AI, says Elon Musk ""If he didn't buy Twitter, would we be talking about him? If he was just a multinational corporation, it would be normal that, if he wants factories in China, he meets with China."" And yet, he adds, Mr Musk has fallen into many of the same pitfalls as his Silicon Valley peers. ""They basically see the world the same way: you're out for yourself, there's no social safety net, you've got to work hard and the best rise to the top,"" Mr Cohen said. ""It's a combination of greed, and a basic mindset that sees intelligence as being the most important factor and the smartest people should run the world."" Mr Cohen says the fact that Mr Musk and other unelected moguls can make unilateral decisions with significant geopolitical consequences is a warning about wealth concentration and waning democracy. ""Is it acceptable for him to be in a position where he can decide whether the satellites go on or not? Is it acceptable for him to lay the public square?"" he asked. ""Just because you're good at programming or business, why would that mean you're good at making rules for how the world should work?""

154,"Elon Musk: Social media platform X, formerly Twitter, could go behind paywall",BBC,2023-09-19,"Elon Musk has suggested that all users of X, formerly called Twitter, may have to pay for access to the platform. In a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the billionaire ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66850821?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Elon Musk has suggested that all users of X, formerly called Twitter, may have to pay for access to the platform. In a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the billionaire said a payment system was the only way to counter bots. ""We're moving to having a small monthly payment for use of the system,"" the Tesla and SpaceX boss said. The BBC approached X for further details but has not yet received a statement from the company. It is unclear whether this was just an off-the-cuff comment, or a signal of firmer plans that have yet to be announced. Mr Musk has long said that his solution for getting rid of bots and fake accounts on the social media platform is charging for verification. Since taking over Twitter last year he has looked to incentivise users to pay for an enhanced service, which is now called X Premium. This has been done by giving paid subscribers more features, like longer posts and increased visibility on the platform.  However, users can currently still use X for free. Although there is a clear financial interest for the company to charge users, Mr Musk insisted that getting people to pay for the service is aimed at tackling bots. ""A bot costs a fraction of a penny"" to make he said. ""But if somebody even has to pay a few dollars or something, some minor amount, the effective cost to bots is very high"". X Premium currently costs $8 (Â£6.50) a month in the US. The price differs depending on which country a subscriber is in. The world's richest person said that he was now looking at cheaper options for users. ""We're actually going to come up with a lower tier pricing. So we just want it to be just a small amount of money,"" he said. ""This is a longer discussion, but in my view, this is actually the only defence against vast armies of bots,"" Mr Musk added. However, a risk is that by putting X behind a paywall it may lose a large chunk of its users. That in turn, could drive down advertising revenue, which currently accounts for the vast majority of the company's income. Mr Musk's conversation with the Israeli prime minister also touched on antisemitism on X. The platform has been accused by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) campaign group of not doing enough to stop antisemitic content. In a statement, the organisation said that Mr Musk was ""engaging with and elevating"" antisemites. Earlier this month, he said that the company would sue the ADL to ""clear our platform's name"". In the conversation with Mr Netanyahu, Mr Musk reiterated that he was ""against antisemitism"". Mr Netanyahu accepted the balance between free speech and content moderation was a challenge but urged Mr Musk to get the balance right. ""I hope you find within the confines of the First Amendment, the ability to stop not only antisemitism... but any collective hatred of people that antisemitism represents,"" he said. ""I know you're committed to that"", Mr Netanyahu added. This video can not be played Watch: Musk takes son to meet Turkish President Erdogan Musk takes son to meet Turkey's President Erdogan.

155,Elon Musk: I will say what I want even if it costs me,BBC,2023-05-19,"Twitter owner Elon Musk has defended his controversial social-media presence, saying he will ""say what I want"" even if it loses him money.

Mr Musk was responding to accusations of antisemitism on Twitter, after his tweet George Soros ""hates humanity"" was criticised by the Israeli government. The tweet was seen as playing into frequently debunked conspiracy theories about the Jewish philanthropist. But Mr Musk told CNBC he held no antisemitic views. He also used the interview to call working from home ""morally wrong"" and criticise technology rival OpenAI. Soros Fund Management cut back the shares it owned in Mr Musk's Tesla company, in May. But company founder Mr Soros is a regular target of conspiracy theories by right-wing figures in the US. And the Israel Foreign Ministry retweeted a post from the country's digital diplomacy director, David Saranga, sharing Twitter trending figures showing more than 27,000 tweets using the term ""The Jews"" following Mr Musk's post.

Former Labour MP David Miliband, Foreign Secretary under Gordon Brown, called Mr Musk's remarks ""totally disgusting"" and said he should retract them. But this was not the only part of the interview to draw criticism. Mr Musk was also questioned about a tweet in which he asked whether a mass shooting had been part of ""a very bad psy-op"" - a baseless conspiracy theory. A ""psy-op"" - or ""psychological operation"" - is a military term for actions used to target and influence behaviours. Mr Musk's words carry considerable weight. One of the world's richest and most influential people, he also owns one of its largest social-media platforms - where he has the single biggest account, with nearly 140 million followers. But in recent months, Mr Musk has increasingly been engaging with false or misleading claims on Twitter.  His remark about the Texas shooting - and Bellingcat, an investigative organisation that reported on it - are the latest in a series of such Twitter engagements by Mr Musk.  Previously, he had repeated misleading claims about: While Mr Musk often tries to be careful with the wording of his tweets, he has been more explicit in promoting the false claim the Texas shooter did not have a neo-Nazi ideology and his online profile might have been a ""psy-op"". This is despite major news outlets reviewing and verifying the shooter's online profiles and Texas police confirming he had extremist and neo-Nazi beliefs. Some of Mr Musk's recent tweets have been fact-checked by Community Notes, a Twitter feature that allows users to add context to false or misleading claims via a voting system. Elsewhere in the interview, Mr Musk also took aim at working from home. ""It's not just a productivity thing,"" he said. ""It's morally wrong."" And it was unfair some people, such as baristas or shop assistants, had to attend work in person while others did not. Mr Musk also suggested the way OpenAI had developed technology such as ChatGPT was unsafe. He said earlier on Tuesday that he was the reason OpenAI existed and in the interview added that he had come ""up with the name"".     In March, Mr Musk was one of many public figures to sign a letter asking for artificial-intelligence development to be put on hold so safeguards and regulation could catch up. But the following month, he created rival AI company X.AI. OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman has not responded to Mr Musk directly but appeared before a Senate Committee on Tuesday calling for AI growth to be regulated.

156,How Elon Musk's tweets unleashed a wave of hate,BBC,2023-03-21,"I had just finished my investigation into whether Twitter can protect users under Elon Musk's ownership, when - to my surprise - the man himself tweeted about it. ""Sorry for turning Twitter from ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64989720,"I had just finished my investigation into whether Twitter can protect users under Elon Musk's ownership, when - to my surprise - the man himself tweeted about it. ""Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that hasâ¦ trolls,"" he said in one tweet, posting a screengrab of the report.  According to Twitter's own data, that tweet was seen by more than 30 million profiles. ""Trolls are kinda fun,"" Mr Musk said in another reply, in his response to my BBC investigation - Twitter insiders: We can't protect users from trolling under Musk. The investigation made clear Twitter was never perfect. But it had exposed how hate is thriving under Twitter's new owner. Current and former Twitter employees told me ""nobody is taking care of"" features designed to protect users from hate and harm. I had approached Elon Musk as part of my Panorama investigation, but he didn't respond.  Instead, he decided to share his reaction to it afterwards with more than 130 million followers on his social media site. His tweets then unleashed a torrent of abuse against me from other users.  There have been hundreds of posts, many including misogynistic slurs and abusive language. There have also been threatening messages, including depictions of kidnap and hanging. Mr Musk posted again, responding to one tweet that was critical of the BBC investigation. He wrote ""roflmao"" - ""rolling on the floor laughing my ass off."" I now found myself wading through more hateful messages sent from accounts predominantly based in the US and UK. Mr Musk's tweets triggered a huge volume of hate, some sent from accounts which had previously been suspended. More proof to back up BBC Panorama's investigation - that hate on Twitter is thriving. The majority of hateful messages were directed at me. Abuse on Twitter is nothing new for me. After all, I'm a reporter who shares my coverage of disinformation, conspiracies and hate there. For my initial investigation, a team from the International Center for Journalists and the University of Sheffield tracked the hate I had received and revealed it had tripled since Elon Musk's takeover, compared to the same period the previous year. Behind The Stories Disinformation Correspondent Marianna Spring talks about reporting on trolls, online abuse and Elon Musk. Watch on BBC iPlayer now (UK Only) Elon Musk's Twitter Storm Marianna Spring investigates how Elon Musk's ownership is transforming one of the world's most influential social media platforms. Watch Elon Musk's Twitter Storm on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) In the wake of Mr Musk's tweets about me, the International Center for Journalists and the University of Sheffield confirmed that the hate had increased again - to the highest levels in the past year. And the tools the team used could not even pick up all the abuse. Some of it didn't use my name directly or was in response to Mr Musk's original tweet, which attracted more than 14,000 replies.  Others were private messages - which included a video of a woman being tied up and held at gunpoint, and another showing hangings. There were also some which included talking about my time ending ""in a horrible way"" and wanting me to ""burn in hell"". Many combined misogynistic slurs with abusive and sexualised language. I was repeatedly called a bitch and much nastier insults. Most of the messages were received on Twitter, with a small number sent to me on other sites following Mr Musk's tweets. During my original investigation, I had looked into profiles sending out abuse on Twitter. Many had become more active on the social media site since Elon Musk decided to restore thousands of suspended accounts. This time, I looked into the accounts sending me abuse. Many of the accounts had become more active since the takeover, and several openly rejoiced how their profiles had returned since Mr Musk bought the platform. Some were prominent conspiracy theorists brought back by Mr Musk. Several had the new paid-for blue ""verified"" ticks. Whenever I've been on the receiving end of a deluge of hate in the past year, I've used social media features to protect myself. This time around, those tools on Twitter didn't appear to be working the same way.  Safety mode, which automatically blocks abusive accounts, was blocking some accounts sharing hate - but it was also, in error, blocking users who were posting supportively. This matches up with what current and former employees at Twitter told me about how features - like the ""harmful reply nudge"", intended to protect Twitter users from trolling and harassment - are proving difficult to maintain and are working inconsistently.  At least half of Twitter's workforce have been sacked or chosen to leave since Mr Musk bought it. When I went back to those insiders to ask what they thought about the new wave of online abuse, several said it further confirmed concerns they had raised about Twitter under Mr Musk. I have approached Elon Musk and Twitter several times to ask about his vision for the social media site. I've been in touch with both Twitter and Mr Musk again to seek their response to the additional spike in hate I've received since his tweets. They have not responded.  Since then, the email account for the Twitter press office now automatically sends out poo emojis in response to requests. Twitter policies, which are publicly available online, say that ""defending and respecting the user's voice"" remains one of its ""core values"". This latest episode raises questions about what freedom of expression really means on the new Twitter, where trolling seems to be fair game and even journalists looking to hold the social media platform to account become the targets.

Mr Musk responded by asking: ""What work have you been doing?",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64871183?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"A Twitter employee has appealed to Elon Musk on the platform to ask whether he had been sacked. In a tweet to the firm's chief executive, Halli Thorleifsson said: ""Your head of HR is not able to confirm if I am employed or not"". Mr Musk responded by asking: ""What work have you been doing?"" Mr Thorleifsson told the BBC that nine days after being frozen out of Twitter's accounts he did not know whether he had been fired or not. After a series of follow up questions and answers with Mr Musk, that read like a live interview for his job, Mr Thorleifsson said he received an email confirming that he had been sacked. Twitter did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. Mr Thorleifsson, 45, was a senior director in product design for Twitter. He told the BBC the ambiguity around his job was ""strange"" and ""extremely stressful"". ""I opened my computer on Sunday morning nine days ago and saw that the screen was grey and locked, indicating that I had been locked out of my Twitter accounts"", he said. ""After a few days had passed I started reaching out to people, including Elon and the head of HR to ask about my situation. ""The head of HR has since twice emailed me and has not been able to answer whether or not I am an employee at Twitter.""  Frustrated, he tweeted his top boss, Elon Musk. Allow Twitter content?

Shortly after that exchange Mr Thorleifsson said that Twitter's Human Resources department had contacted him and said that he had been fired.  The exchange was widely shared on Twitter, with Mr Musk wading in with some replies.  He went on to further criticise Mr Thorleifsson saying: ""The reality is that this guy (who is independently wealthy) did no actual work, claimed as his excuse that he had a disability that prevented him from typing, yet was simultaneously tweeting up a storm.  ""Can't say I have a lot of respect for that."" The Iceland-based entrepreneur had sold his company, Ueno, a creative design agency, to Twitter in early 2021 - after founding the firm in Reykjavik in 2014.  As part of the acquisition he became a full-time employee at Twitter. ""I decided to sell for a few reasons but one of them is that I have muscular dystrophy and my body is slowly but surely failing me,"" he told the BBC.  ""I have a few good work years left in me so this was a way to wrap up my company, and set up myself and my family for years when I won't be able to do as much.""  Mr Thorleifsson is worried that Mr Musk will not honour the contract he signed with Twitter when he sold them his company.  ""This is extremely stressful. This is my retirement fund, a way to take care of myself and my family as my disease progresses. Having the richest man in the world on the other end of this, potentially refusing to stand by contracts is not easy for me to accept,"" he said.  Last month, Elon Musk appeared to fire another 200 Twitter employees. It means that Twitter now has just over 2,000 workers - down from approximately 7,500 in October.  ""Companies let people go, that's within their rights,"" Mr Thorleifsson said. ""They usually tell people about it but that's seemingly the optional part at Twitter now"".

158,Six things we learned from Elon Musk interview,BBC,2023-04-14,"Mr Musk refused to accept there was more hateful content on the platform since he took over. Speaking to the BBC earlier this year, some Twitter insiders have argued that the company is no longer ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-65251160?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"This video can not be played Watch: Elon Musk's unexpected BBC interview... in 90 seconds Elon Musk has defended how he runs Twitter in a rare and wide-ranging interview with the BBC. The world's second richest man was questioned for nearly an hour by the BBC's technology correspondent James Clayton at Twitter headquarters in San Francisco. Here are six things we learned. Mr Musk refused to accept there was more hateful content on the platform since he took over. Speaking to the BBC earlier this year, some Twitter insiders have argued that the company is no longer able to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, following lay-offs and changes under owner Mr Musk. In March, Twitter said it removed 400,000 accounts in one month alone to help ""make Twitter safer"". In order to assess Mr Musk's claims fully you'd need two things which we don't have at present - access to Twitter's data before and after his takeover and, crucially, a clear understanding of how he defines misinformation and hate speech.  There is no blanket definition of hate speech under American law, which is generally much more permissive than other countries because of the first amendment to the US Constitution. Close to half the country voted for Mr Trump in the last US election, Mr Musk said, but he added: ""I wasn't one of them. I voted for Biden."" In another part of the interview, he defended ending a Twitter ban on Mr Trump who had been removed in 2021 when the platform accused him of inciting violence. Mr Musk claimed his efforts to delete bots - automated accounts - had decreased misinformation on Twitter after his takeover. ""My experience is there is less misinformation rather than more,"" he told our reporter. Some outside experts disagree. A study from Newsguard which tracks online misinformation  - and there are quite a few other studies along the same lines - found that engagement with popular, misinformation-spreading accounts spiked after Mr Musk's takeover. In the week following his acquisition of Twitter, the most popular, untrustworthy accounts enjoyed an almost 60% increase in engagement in the form of likes and retweets, according to the survey. The BBC has also independently analysed more than 1,000 previously-banned accounts that had been let back on Twitter after Mr Musk's takeover, and found that since being reinstated, over a third of them had spread abuse or misinformation. This included false anti-vax claims, misogyny and anti-LGBT rhetoric, and the denial of the 2020 US election result.  Mr Musk says he doesn't use the most downloaded app in the US but he is against any moves to close it down. The US is considering a ban due to security concerns over TikTok's Chinese ownership. Some other countries have banned it from the phones of government employees. ""I'm generally against banning things,"" said Mr Musk, although he says a ban would benefit Twitter because it may mean more people spending time on his platform. Mr Musk initially claimed in the interview that if someone offered to buy Twitter right now for what he paid for it, he'd refuse.  If he did sell, he said it would be more important to find a buyer who cherishes the ""truth"" rather than how much they'd pay because, as he says: ""I don't care about the money.""   But is that true? Remember, he desperately tried to back out of the deal. Mr Musk said Twitter had just months left to live when he took over and was being run like a non-profit. Twitter's costs were outstripping the amount of revenue it was generating. In its last full-year results published before Mr Musk took over, total sales hit $5bn in 2021 but costs and expenses reached $5.5bn. In fact, it has only had two profitable years since 2012. He reckons Twitter is now close to breaking even. No wonder - sacking 6,500 workers does tend to lighten one's costs. But he has also been proactive in finding ways to boost sales through things such as charging Twitter users for ""blue tick"" verification. So yes, Twitter might be nearing breaking even now because of drastic cost-cutting. But the question is whether it can sustain that path to profitability and make the company worth that $44bn price tag. This video can not be played Kara Swisher: 'Musk the one who caused the pain' Mr Musk confirmed he would change the BBC Twitter label from ""government funded"" to ""publicly funded"" after last week's row, and several hours after the interview this change was made. The BBC had objected to the original description, stressing the corporation's independence. It is mainly funded by the British public through a TV licence fee. In Wednesday's interview, Mr Musk said: ""If we use the same words as the BBC uses to describe itself, that presumably would be OK.""  The licence fee made up about 71% of the BBC's total income of Â£5.3bn in 2022 - with the rest coming from its commercial and other activities like grants, royalties and rental income. The BBC also receives more than Â£90m per year from the government to support the BBC World Service, which predominantly serves non-UK audiences.

The boss of the electric car company is on trial after investors claimed the 2018 tweet cost them millions of dollars when a deal did not go ahead. Mr Musk claims that he had met with a Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund which indicated support for a deal. But he admitted he never discussed a specific funding amount.  Mr Musk is accused of defrauding investors after he tweeted on 7 August 2018 that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 (Â£341) per share, and that ""investor support is confirmed"".

The tweet sent shares in Tesla soaring, but weeks later they fell back when Mr Musk said the plan was no longer going ahead, causing a significant backlash for the billionaire.  He was forced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US regulator, to step down as Tesla's chairman and had to have any tweets related to Tesla vetted by an independent committee. He and Tesla were also fined $20m each to settle a claim by the SEC that he had committed securities fraud.  At the jury trial in a San Francisco court on Tuesday, Mr Musk and his attorney argued that the deal was seriously considered for about two weeks, with discussions with major investors and other firms.  Mr Musk said he eventually scrapped the plan after his discussions with smaller investors led him to believe they would prefer that the firm remain publicly traded on the stock market. ""I felt it was important to be responsive to their wishes,"" he said, later citing a letter he received from Cathie Wood, chief executive of Ark Investment, a firm that manages billions of dollars worth in assets.     Mr Musk said he thought sharing his consideration of the potential buyout was the ""right thing"" to do because he was worried an article in the Financial Times about Saudi Arabia's stake in the company would put ordinary investors at a disadvantage. ""I thought I was doing the right thing,"" he said on Tuesday, his third day testifying in the case.  ""I was concerned when receiving the Financial Times article that the information had leaked and that some investors would be aware that I was considering taking the company private and this would disadvantage other investors, especially small shareholders."" On Monday, Mr Musk told a court in San Francisco that he had met with people from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund on 31 July, 2018. He said that while a price for taking Tesla private was not discussed, he claimed that the representatives from the fund made it clear they backed a deal. Mr Musk claimed Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the fund's governor, then appeared to backpedal on the pledge. ""I was very upset because he had been unequivocal in his support for taking Tesla private when we met and now he appeared to be backpedaling,"" he said. Mr Musk was also questioned about how he decided on a price of $420 a share and whether it was a reference to marijuana. In American counterculture, the significance of 420 is said to have come from a group of students in California in the 1970s who used to meet after school at 4:20pm to smoke and to search for a patch of cannabis plants.  Later on, 20 April became a day when thousands of people gathered to celebrate marijuana. In the US, dates are written with the number of the month first, then the day - in this case 4/20. Mr Musk, who has smoked cannabis in public but claimed not to be a regular user, told the court: ""420 was not chosen because of a joke; it was chosen because there was a 20% premium over the stock price."" He added that there was ""some karma around 420"", though ""I should question whether that is good or bad karma at this point."" Mr Musk, who bought the social media platform Twitter for $44bn last year, had told the court on Friday that he did not think that his tweets had affected Tesla's share price. ""Just because I tweet something does not mean people believe it or will act accordingly,"" he told jurors. Mr Musk will continue testifying on Tuesday. He had attempted to have the trial moved from California to Texas due to concerns that a jury would be biased against him due to media coverage of the businessman.  Following his takeover of Twitter, which is headquartered in San Francisco, thousands of staff lost their jobs. ""We don't think we can get a fair trial in this district, period, full stop,"" said Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Mr Musk. Mr Spiro claimed: ""The media reports are character assassinations."" The request was denied by Judge Edward Chen.  During jury selection, potential jurors expressed a wide range of opinions about Mr Musk. Some described him as ""smart"" and a ""genius"".  Another said he was ""a little off his rocker"".  One woman suggested that ""he is not a very likable person,""  When asked by the judge whether that meant she would not be impartial towards him, the woman responded: Â ""A lot of people are not necessarily likable peopleâ¦. sometimes I don't like my husband.""

160,Neuralink: Why is Elon Musk’s brain chip firm in the news?,BBC,2023-05-26,"Elon Musk's brain chip firm Neuralink has said that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its first human clinical trial, a critical milestone after earlier struggles to gain ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65729383,"Elon Musk's brain chip firm Neuralink has said that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its first human clinical trial, a critical milestone after earlier struggles to gain approval.  The FDA nod ""represents an important first step that will one day allow our technology to help many people,"" Neuralink said in a tweet.  It did not elaborate on the aims of the study, saying only that it was not recruiting yet, and more details would be available soon.  The firm says it is trying to create a new way to allow computers to communicate directly with the human brain.   The hope is that by doing this, Neuralink would be able to tackle complex neurological conditions which have so far proved beyond the capability of medical intervention. These range from paralysis and blindness to depression and schizophrenia.  The procedure would involve implanting a tiny hermetically sealed chip directly into a patient's brain.  The chip is connected to 1,024 tiny electrodes, no thicker than a human hair and is powered by a battery that can be recharged wirelessly. It would create an interface with an external computer, allowing it to both send and receive signals. There are three elements to this: short term physical risks; long term medical concerns; and ethical safety.  Any surgery involving the brain carries inherent danger, both of physical harm and rejection by the host. There has been extensive (and controversial) testing of the chips on animals.  A complaint filed in February to the US Department of Agriculture alleged cruel treatment of macaque monkeys who are being used to test the technology.  The fact that the FDA has approved the start of human testing, however, implies the company has overcome some of the challenges.  Maybe the more serious concerns come around the long-term consequences of having a device like this operating within the human brain, a vastly complex organ we are only beginning to understand.  Understandably there is no data as to what the potential harms may be. That will change with testing on humans and will be key to the development of similar products.  The final element, ethical safety, is more subjective. Technology like this is riven with concerns about data protection, potential uses and the possibility of human enhancement.  This means augmenting or enhancing the capabilities of the human brain beyond what we are currently capable of doing. For example, improving human cognition, sensory perception, or physical abilities. This always stirs strong emotions and raises ethical questions so there will be calls for close regulation of the sector. The firm was founded in California by Elon Musk and a team of seven scientists and engineers in 2016.  But of last year, of the eight cofounders, only two remained at the company. Elon Musk brings an entrepreneurial approach to tackling an issue which many see as fundamentally scientific. He also inevitably brings something else - publicity. He is one of the most recognisable and controversial people on the planet.  When he speaks, generally people listen and react. His involvement in Neuralink is one of the reasons people are talking about it today.  Yes, quite a few are, with some said to be further on in their research than Neuralink. Black Rock Neuro Tech are working on a similar product, also implanting chips into the human brain.  There's lots of different work being done, however, not all of it so invasive. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, are thought to be working on wearable tech that would allow people to type with their minds.  Last week news emerged of a paralysed man helped to walk again by Swiss scientists. In short, this is a rapidly expanding field with many players.  Elon Musk's involvement guarantees that Neuralink will often win the race for publicity, but that will not ultimately decide which firms succeed.  That will come down to which technology works best and who can prove to regulators and markets that it is safe.

161,Modi in US: Elon Musk says Tesla to come to India 'as soon as possible',BBC,2023-06-21,"The Indian government said it had invited Mr Musk to explore investment opportunities in electric mobility and the commercial space sector. Mr Musk said he was ""trying to figure out the right ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-65959115?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the electric carmaker will be in India ""as soon as humanly possible"". His comments followed a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is on a state visit to the US. The Indian government said it had invited Mr Musk to explore investment opportunities in electric mobility and the commercial space sector. Mr Musk said he was ""trying to figure out the right timing"" to make that happen. Mr Modi's meeting with Mr Musk, who also owns Twitter, came days after Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey accused India of threatening to shut down the platform for not complying with its orders to take down content from the website. Mr Dorsey's allegations, made in an interview with an independent news show, were strongly denied by the Indian government, which called it ""an outright lie"". Mr Musk commented on the episode on Wednesday and said that Twitter didn't have a choice but to obey local governments or ""we will get shut down"". ""We will do our best to provide the freest speech that is possible under the law,"" he said. Mr Musk also called himself a ""fan of Mr Modi"" and said that India had ""more promise than any large country in the world"".  ""He [Mr Modi] really cares about India because he's pushing us to make significant investments in India, which is something we intend to do. We are just trying to figure out the right timing,"" he told reporters. ""I am confident that Tesla will be in India and will do so as soon as humanly possible."" Tesla has been in talks with Indian bureaucrats and ministers as it looks to enter the domestic market.  Reuters reported last month that Tesla had proposed setting up a factory to build electric vehicles and was also looking at manufacturing EV batteries in the country. ""They are very seriously looking at India as a production and innovation base,"" federal minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar had told the agency in May.  The company's original plans to open base in India were shelved last year after the Indian government insisted Tesla to make cars locally, while the carmaker said it wanted to export to India first so that it could test demand. Mr Musk said that he also hoped also bring Starlink satellite internet service, operated by his company SpaceX, to India. ""We do not want to jump the gun on an announcement but I think it is quite likely that it will be a significant investment in our relationship with India,"" he told reporters.  Mr Modi arrived in New York on Tuesday for a three-day state visit which is being seen has a turning point for bilateral relations between India and the US.  He will be given a ceremonial welcome at the White House on Thursday before he holds direct talks with President Joe Biden. On Tuesday, over 70 US lawmakers wrote to Mr Biden, urging him to raise human rights issues with Mr Modi during his trip. They said they were concerned about growing religious intolerance, press freedoms, and the targeting of civil society groups in India. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

""They trained illegally using Twitter data. Lawsuit time,"" the multi-billionaire said in a tweet. Mr Musk was responding to Microsoft's plan to remove Twitter from its corporate advertising platform. He did not provide further details or evidence to support the claim. Microsoft declined to comment when approached by the BBC on Thursday. Earlier, the company said in a notice that its advertising platform would ""no longer support Twitter"" from Tuesday 25 April.

As a result, ad buyers would not be able to access their Twitter accounts through Microsoft's social management tool. ""Other social media channels such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn will continue to be available,"" Microsoft said. Twitter's press email responded to a query with a customary poo emoji. In a separate tweet, in the discussion about the social media platform's data, Mr Musk said he was ""open to ideas"". ""But ripping off the Twitter database, demonetizing it (removing ads) and then selling our data to others isn't a winning solution,"" he added. In February, Twitter started charging for the data it collects from ""hundreds of millions"" of users, with a basic plan starting at $100 a month. The data allows users to ""manage and track every aspect of your social media presence"", according to the platform. Since buying Twitter for $44bn (Â£35.4bn) in October, Mr Musk has cut its workforce by around 80% and moved to boost the company's finances through measures including charging users for ""blue tick"" verification. In recent months, major companies including iPhone maker Apple reportedly halted advertising on the platform over concerns about how content was moderated on the site. In November, Mr Musk said Twitter had seen a ""massive"" drop in revenue and blamed activists for pressuring advertisers. Speaking to the BBC last week, he said Twitter had just months left to live when he took over. He also said ""almost all advertisers have come back or said they are going to come back"" to Twitter. Mr Musk added that Twitter could be profitable by the second quarter of 2023, and he would be willing to sell the company if the right person came along.

164,Six things we learned from Elon Musk interview,BBC,2023-04-14,"Mr Musk refused to accept there was more hateful content on the platform since he took over. Speaking to the BBC earlier this year, some Twitter insiders have argued that the company is no longer ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-65251160,"This video can not be played Watch: Elon Musk's unexpected BBC interview... in 90 seconds Elon Musk has defended how he runs Twitter in a rare and wide-ranging interview with the BBC. The world's second richest man was questioned for nearly an hour by the BBC's technology correspondent James Clayton at Twitter headquarters in San Francisco. Here are six things we learned. Mr Musk refused to accept there was more hateful content on the platform since he took over. Speaking to the BBC earlier this year, some Twitter insiders have argued that the company is no longer able to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, following lay-offs and changes under owner Mr Musk. In March, Twitter said it removed 400,000 accounts in one month alone to help ""make Twitter safer"". In order to assess Mr Musk's claims fully you'd need two things which we don't have at present - access to Twitter's data before and after his takeover and, crucially, a clear understanding of how he defines misinformation and hate speech.  There is no blanket definition of hate speech under American law, which is generally much more permissive than other countries because of the first amendment to the US Constitution. Close to half the country voted for Mr Trump in the last US election, Mr Musk said, but he added: ""I wasn't one of them. I voted for Biden."" In another part of the interview, he defended ending a Twitter ban on Mr Trump who had been removed in 2021 when the platform accused him of inciting violence. Mr Musk claimed his efforts to delete bots - automated accounts - had decreased misinformation on Twitter after his takeover. ""My experience is there is less misinformation rather than more,"" he told our reporter. Some outside experts disagree. A study from Newsguard which tracks online misinformation  - and there are quite a few other studies along the same lines - found that engagement with popular, misinformation-spreading accounts spiked after Mr Musk's takeover. In the week following his acquisition of Twitter, the most popular, untrustworthy accounts enjoyed an almost 60% increase in engagement in the form of likes and retweets, according to the survey. The BBC has also independently analysed more than 1,000 previously-banned accounts that had been let back on Twitter after Mr Musk's takeover, and found that since being reinstated, over a third of them had spread abuse or misinformation. This included false anti-vax claims, misogyny and anti-LGBT rhetoric, and the denial of the 2020 US election result.  Mr Musk says he doesn't use the most downloaded app in the US but he is against any moves to close it down. The US is considering a ban due to security concerns over TikTok's Chinese ownership. Some other countries have banned it from the phones of government employees. ""I'm generally against banning things,"" said Mr Musk, although he says a ban would benefit Twitter because it may mean more people spending time on his platform. Mr Musk initially claimed in the interview that if someone offered to buy Twitter right now for what he paid for it, he'd refuse.  If he did sell, he said it would be more important to find a buyer who cherishes the ""truth"" rather than how much they'd pay because, as he says: ""I don't care about the money.""   But is that true? Remember, he desperately tried to back out of the deal. Mr Musk said Twitter had just months left to live when he took over and was being run like a non-profit. Twitter's costs were outstripping the amount of revenue it was generating. In its last full-year results published before Mr Musk took over, total sales hit $5bn in 2021 but costs and expenses reached $5.5bn. In fact, it has only had two profitable years since 2012. He reckons Twitter is now close to breaking even. No wonder - sacking 6,500 workers does tend to lighten one's costs. But he has also been proactive in finding ways to boost sales through things such as charging Twitter users for ""blue tick"" verification. So yes, Twitter might be nearing breaking even now because of drastic cost-cutting. But the question is whether it can sustain that path to profitability and make the company worth that $44bn price tag. This video can not be played Kara Swisher: 'Musk the one who caused the pain' Mr Musk confirmed he would change the BBC Twitter label from ""government funded"" to ""publicly funded"" after last week's row, and several hours after the interview this change was made. The BBC had objected to the original description, stressing the corporation's independence. It is mainly funded by the British public through a TV licence fee. In Wednesday's interview, Mr Musk said: ""If we use the same words as the BBC uses to describe itself, that presumably would be OK.""  The licence fee made up about 71% of the BBC's total income of Â£5.3bn in 2022 - with the rest coming from its commercial and other activities like grants, royalties and rental income. The BBC also receives more than Â£90m per year from the government to support the BBC World Service, which predominantly serves non-UK audiences.

The boss of the electric car company is on trial after investors claimed the 2018 tweet cost them millions of dollars when a deal did not go ahead. Mr Musk claims that he had met with a Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund which indicated support for a deal. But he admitted he never discussed a specific funding amount.  Mr Musk is accused of defrauding investors after he tweeted on 7 August 2018 that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 (Â£341) per share, and that ""investor support is confirmed"".

The tweet sent shares in Tesla soaring, but weeks later they fell back when Mr Musk said the plan was no longer going ahead, causing a significant backlash for the billionaire.  He was forced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US regulator, to step down as Tesla's chairman and had to have any tweets related to Tesla vetted by an independent committee. He and Tesla were also fined $20m each to settle a claim by the SEC that he had committed securities fraud.  At the jury trial in a San Francisco court on Tuesday, Mr Musk and his attorney argued that the deal was seriously considered for about two weeks, with discussions with major investors and other firms.  Mr Musk said he eventually scrapped the plan after his discussions with smaller investors led him to believe they would prefer that the firm remain publicly traded on the stock market. ""I felt it was important to be responsive to their wishes,"" he said, later citing a letter he received from Cathie Wood, chief executive of Ark Investment, a firm that manages billions of dollars worth in assets.     Mr Musk said he thought sharing his consideration of the potential buyout was the ""right thing"" to do because he was worried an article in the Financial Times about Saudi Arabia's stake in the company would put ordinary investors at a disadvantage. ""I thought I was doing the right thing,"" he said on Tuesday, his third day testifying in the case.  ""I was concerned when receiving the Financial Times article that the information had leaked and that some investors would be aware that I was considering taking the company private and this would disadvantage other investors, especially small shareholders."" On Monday, Mr Musk told a court in San Francisco that he had met with people from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund on 31 July, 2018. He said that while a price for taking Tesla private was not discussed, he claimed that the representatives from the fund made it clear they backed a deal. Mr Musk claimed Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the fund's governor, then appeared to backpedal on the pledge. ""I was very upset because he had been unequivocal in his support for taking Tesla private when we met and now he appeared to be backpedaling,"" he said. Mr Musk was also questioned about how he decided on a price of $420 a share and whether it was a reference to marijuana. In American counterculture, the significance of 420 is said to have come from a group of students in California in the 1970s who used to meet after school at 4:20pm to smoke and to search for a patch of cannabis plants.  Later on, 20 April became a day when thousands of people gathered to celebrate marijuana. In the US, dates are written with the number of the month first, then the day - in this case 4/20. Mr Musk, who has smoked cannabis in public but claimed not to be a regular user, told the court: ""420 was not chosen because of a joke; it was chosen because there was a 20% premium over the stock price."" He added that there was ""some karma around 420"", though ""I should question whether that is good or bad karma at this point."" Mr Musk, who bought the social media platform Twitter for $44bn last year, had told the court on Friday that he did not think that his tweets had affected Tesla's share price. ""Just because I tweet something does not mean people believe it or will act accordingly,"" he told jurors. Mr Musk will continue testifying on Tuesday. He had attempted to have the trial moved from California to Texas due to concerns that a jury would be biased against him due to media coverage of the businessman.  Following his takeover of Twitter, which is headquartered in San Francisco, thousands of staff lost their jobs. ""We don't think we can get a fair trial in this district, period, full stop,"" said Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Mr Musk. Mr Spiro claimed: ""The media reports are character assassinations."" The request was denied by Judge Edward Chen.  During jury selection, potential jurors expressed a wide range of opinions about Mr Musk. Some described him as ""smart"" and a ""genius"".  Another said he was ""a little off his rocker"".  One woman suggested that ""he is not a very likable person,""  When asked by the judge whether that meant she would not be impartial towards him, the woman responded: Â ""A lot of people are not necessarily likable peopleâ¦. sometimes I don't like my husband.""

166,"Twitter temporarily restricts tweets users can see, Elon Musk announces",BBC,2023-07-02,"Twitter has applied a temporary limit to the number of tweets users can read in a day, owner Elon Musk has said. In a tweet of his own, Mr Musk said unverified accounts are now limited to reading ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66077195,"Twitter has applied a temporary limit to the number of tweets users can read in a day, owner Elon Musk has said. In a tweet of his own, Mr Musk said unverified accounts are now limited to reading 1,000 posts a day.  For new unverified accounts, the number is 500. Meanwhile, accounts with ""verified"" status are currently limited to 10,000 posts a day. The tech billionaire initially set stricter limits, but he changed these within hours of announcing the move. Mr Musk said the temporary limits were to address ""extreme levels of data scraping and system manipulation"". He did not explain what was meant by system manipulation in this context. ""We were getting data pillaged so much that it was degrading service for normal users,"" Mr Musk explained on Friday, after users were presented with screens asking them to log in to view Twitter content.  The move was described as a ""temporary emergency measure"". It is not totally clear what Mr Musk is referring to by data scraping, but it appears he means the scraping of large amounts of data used by artificial intelligence (AI) companies to train large language models, which power chatbots such as Open AI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard. In simple terms, data scraping is the pulling of information from the internet. Large language models need to learn from masses of real human conversations. But the quality is vital to the success of a chatbot. Reddit and Twitter's huge trove of billions of posts are thought to be hugely important training data - and used by AI companies. But platforms like Twitter and Reddit want to be paid for this data.  In April, Reddit's chief executive Steve Huffman told the New York Times that he was unhappy with what AI companies were doing. ""The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,"" he said. ""But we don't need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free."" Twitter has already started charging users to access its application programming interface (API), which is often used by third party apps and researchers - which can include AI companies. There are other potential reasons for the move too. Mr Musk has been pushing people towards Twitter Blue, its paid subscription service. It's possible he is looking at a model where users will have to pay to get a full Twitter service - and access to unlimited posts. Signalled by a blue tick, ""verified"" status was given for free by Twitter to high-profile accounts before Mr Musk took over as its boss. Now, most users have to pay a subscription fee from $8 (Â£6.30) per month to be verified, and can gain the status regardless of their profile. According to the website Downdetector - which tracks online outages - a peak of 5,126 people reported problems accessing the platform in the UK at 16:12 BST on Saturday. In the US, roughly 7,461 people reported glitches around the same time.  Initially, Mr Musk announced reading limits of 6,000 posts per day for verified accounts, 600 for unverified accounts, and 300 for new unverified accounts. In another update Mr Musk said ""several hundred organisations (maybe more) were scraping Twitter data extremely aggressively"".  He later indicated there had been a burden on his website, saying it was ""rather galling to have to bring large numbers of servers online on an emergency basis"".   A server is a powerful computer that manages and stores files, providing services such as web pages for users. Adam Leon Smith from BCS, the UK's professional body for IT, said the move was ""very odd"" as limiting users' scroll time would affect the company's advertising revenue. Mr Musk bought the company last year for $44bn (Â£35bn) after much back and forth. He was critical of Twitter's previous management and said he did not want the platform to become an echo chamber. Soon after taking over, he cut the workforce from just under 8,000 staff to about 1,500. In an interview with the BBC, he said that cutting the workforce had not been easy. Engineers were included in the layoffs and their exit raised concerns about the platform's stability. But while Mr Musk acknowledged some glitches, he told the BBC in April that outages had not lasted very long and the site was working fine.

167,'Elon Musk has made me embarrassed to drive my Tesla now',BBC,2023-02-27,"When Anne Marie Squeo received her fiery red Tesla sports utility vehicle in 2020, the 55-year-old marketing and communications professional felt like she had joined a special ""club"" of people who ...",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64376727,"When Anne Marie Squeo received her fiery red Tesla sports utility vehicle in 2020, the 55-year-old marketing and communications professional felt like she had joined a special ""club"" of people who were doing something to help the environment, while still driving with style.  But last year, as Tesla boss Elon Musk shared right-wing conspiracy theories on Twitter, posted a picture of guns by his bedside, and proposed terms to resolve the war in Ukraine that were adamantly rejected by many of the country's top leaders, Anne Marie's satisfaction gave way to shame.  ""It's been very depressing, and sometimes embarrassing to be driving this car around,"" says Anne Marie, a former journalist who lives in Connecticut and wrote an article about her discomfort. ""I wondered if people were making a judgement about me that I wasn't looking for."" Once hailed as the secret to Tesla's success, Elon Musk now appears to be one of its biggest problems, as his steady stream of politically charged social media posts alienates key parts of Tesla's customer base, just as increased competition starts to eat away at the firm's dominance of the electric car market. The value of Tesla shares plunged by roughly two-thirds last year - the biggest decline since the company went public in 2010 - reflecting the worries, as well as concerns about disruptions to production and the effect of high borrowing costs and a weaker economy on demand. In December, major investors - many of them long-time allies of Mr Musk - went public with their alarm, accusing him of abandoning Tesla after his $44bn (Â£36.4bn) takeover of Twitter in October and damaging the car company's brand.  The fact that Mr Musk sold roughly $20bn worth of Tesla shares last year - sales that weighed on the stock and were prompted at least in part by the Twitter purchase - did not help.  ""It's cost everybody a tonne of money. Certainly it didn't protect Tesla shareholders,"" says investor Ross Gerber, who is now seeking a seat on Tesla's board of directors and calling for changes, including starting to spend money on advertising, which Tesla has long prided itself on being able to do without.  Mr Gerber, the head of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management and a self-described friend of Mr Musk, says he remains optimistic about the company's fortunes, and has increased his firm's holdings as the stock has tumbled.  But he says the company needs to have a dedicated chief executive and create its own voice, one distinct from Mr Musk.  ""It's very hard to believe now that Elon is a positive advertising force for Tesla,"" he says.  Mr Musk, who has more than 127 million followers on Twitter, this week rejected suggestions that his unfiltered style on social media was hurting the Tesla brand, saying his mass following ""speaks for itself"". But in recent weeks, facing concerns about buyer demand, Tesla announced major price cuts in the US, Europe and China - running as high as 20% on some models in the US.   Analysts expect the move to blunt some of the brand damage, as financial considerations outweigh buyers' moral qualms. But the move will hurt the firm's profit margins, and for some car purchasers there is no turning back.  Indie Grant, who works in the insurance industry in New Zealand, ruled out a Tesla due to Mr Musk's politics when buying an electric car last year, opting for a Peugeot instead.   ""With him being so tied to the brand, buying a Tesla feels very much like a passive but regular announcement of 'I think Elon is great. I love everything he does,'"" the 35-year-old says. ""That really wasn't the message we wanted to give and with so many options, taking that out of the running didn't affect the choices too much.""  There is little that would prompt a Tesla purchase now, Indie says. ""My opinion of Tesla would only change if he weren't associated with it anymore."" Mr Musk has landed in hot water for his social media posts before.  One - about considering taking Tesla private in 2018 - sparked fraud accusations from regulators, which the firm and Mr Musk each paid $20m to settle. He was in court again this week defending the post in a class-action suit brought by shareholders who said they lost money in the share price gyrations that followed its publication.  Another - calling a man involved in the rescue of Thai schoolboys a ""pedo guy"" - led to a defamation case, which Mr Musk won, after saying he did not think the insult would be taken seriously.  Now, though, Mr Musk isn't just another person tweeting; he is the owner of the platform. That has raised the prospect of his political views, which he shares with increasing frequency, affecting how Twitter moderates the content on its site - a matter described by many, including Mr Musk, as important to American democracy. After taking over, Mr Musk moved quickly to remove the ban on former US President Donald Trump, also issuing a tweet that read: ""My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci"" - referring to Dr Anthony Fauci, the public face of the US Covid-19 response - causing outrage among liberals, who are the most likely to buy electric cars in the US,Tesla's biggest market.  ""This is largely a political story,"" says Jordan Marlatt, tech analyst at Morning Consult, which tracks public perception of thousands of brands in the US, and has seen a sharp decline in favourability towards Tesla among Democrats since April, when Mr Musk first announced the Twitter deal.  ""He's been a lot more outspoken on his personal politics than he has before and that's bleeding over to consumer sentiment."" Mr Marlatt says brands typically recover from damage stemming from politically charged incidents within 90 days. ""What's different for Twitter and for Tesla is that steady drumbeat,"" he says. ""It's every day, almost every hour sometimes."" Anne Marie, who has voted for both Democrats and Republicans, says prior controversies felt like one-off events, but the flood of commentary last year wore her down.  ""Elon Musk being a bit of a wild card is not new,"" she says. ""What was different was this level of consistency in doing it every day and the fact that he was really going after social issues with the seeming intent of riling people up."" She says at the moment she can't imagine buying a Tesla the next time she needs a car. ""At the end of the day, there's a lot of variety to choose from - are you going to really align yourself with a company that maybe doesn't represent your values anymore? I wouldn't feel comfortable doing it.""

168,Modi in US: Elon Musk says Tesla to come to India 'as soon as possible',BBC,2023-07-08,"The Indian government said it had invited Mr Musk to explore investment opportunities in electric mobility and the commercial space sector. Mr Musk said he was ""trying to figure out the right ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-65959115,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the electric carmaker will be in India ""as soon as humanly possible"". His comments followed a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is on a state visit to the US. The Indian government said it had invited Mr Musk to explore investment opportunities in electric mobility and the commercial space sector. Mr Musk said he was ""trying to figure out the right timing"" to make that happen. Mr Modi's meeting with Mr Musk, who also owns Twitter, came days after Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey accused India of threatening to shut down the platform for not complying with its orders to take down content from the website. Mr Dorsey's allegations, made in an interview with an independent news show, were strongly denied by the Indian government, which called it ""an outright lie"". Mr Musk commented on the episode on Wednesday and said that Twitter didn't have a choice but to obey local governments or ""we will get shut down"". ""We will do our best to provide the freest speech that is possible under the law,"" he said. Mr Musk also called himself a ""fan of Mr Modi"" and said that India had ""more promise than any large country in the world"".  ""He [Mr Modi] really cares about India because he's pushing us to make significant investments in India, which is something we intend to do. We are just trying to figure out the right timing,"" he told reporters. ""I am confident that Tesla will be in India and will do so as soon as humanly possible."" Tesla has been in talks with Indian bureaucrats and ministers as it looks to enter the domestic market.  Reuters reported last month that Tesla had proposed setting up a factory to build electric vehicles and was also looking at manufacturing EV batteries in the country. ""They are very seriously looking at India as a production and innovation base,"" federal minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar had told the agency in May.  The company's original plans to open base in India were shelved last year after the Indian government insisted Tesla to make cars locally, while the carmaker said it wanted to export to India first so that it could test demand. Mr Musk said that he also hoped also bring Starlink satellite internet service, operated by his company SpaceX, to India. ""We do not want to jump the gun on an announcement but I think it is quite likely that it will be a significant investment in our relationship with India,"" he told reporters.  Mr Modi arrived in New York on Tuesday for a three-day state visit which is being seen has a turning point for bilateral relations between India and the US.  He will be given a ceremonial welcome at the White House on Thursday before he holds direct talks with President Joe Biden. On Tuesday, over 70 US lawmakers wrote to Mr Biden, urging him to raise human rights issues with Mr Modi during his trip. They said they were concerned about growing religious intolerance, press freedoms, and the targeting of civil society groups in India. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

""They trained illegally using Twitter data. Lawsuit time,"" the multi-billionaire said in a tweet. Mr Musk was responding to Microsoft's plan to remove Twitter from its corporate advertising platform. He did not provide further details or evidence to support the claim. Microsoft declined to comment when approached by the BBC on Thursday. Earlier, the company said in a notice that its advertising platform would ""no longer support Twitter"" from Tuesday 25 April.

As a result, ad buyers would not be able to access their Twitter accounts through Microsoft's social management tool. ""Other social media channels such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn will continue to be available,"" Microsoft said. Twitter's press email responded to a query with a customary poo emoji. In a separate tweet, in the discussion about the social media platform's data, Mr Musk said he was ""open to ideas"". ""But ripping off the Twitter database, demonetizing it (removing ads) and then selling our data to others isn't a winning solution,"" he added. In February, Twitter started charging for the data it collects from ""hundreds of millions"" of users, with a basic plan starting at $100 a month. The data allows users to ""manage and track every aspect of your social media presence"", according to the platform. Since buying Twitter for $44bn (Â£35.4bn) in October, Mr Musk has cut its workforce by around 80% and moved to boost the company's finances through measures including charging users for ""blue tick"" verification. In recent months, major companies including iPhone maker Apple reportedly halted advertising on the platform over concerns about how content was moderated on the site. In November, Mr Musk said Twitter had seen a ""massive"" drop in revenue and blamed activists for pressuring advertisers. Speaking to the BBC last week, he said Twitter had just months left to live when he took over. He also said ""almost all advertisers have come back or said they are going to come back"" to Twitter. Mr Musk added that Twitter could be profitable by the second quarter of 2023, and he would be willing to sell the company if the right person came along.

On Sunday ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66420177,"Elon Musk has said X, formerly known as Twitter, will pay the legal bills of anyone who is treated unfairly by their employer for their activity on his social media platform. On Sunday, Mr Musk told users that financial assistance from his platform would have ""no limits"". He asked users to ""let us know"" if they had experienced unfair treatment for posting or liking something. Formerly known as Twitter, the social media platform was renamed last month. Mr Musk is a self-described ""free speech absolutist"" and has been vocal in his criticisms of the platform's policies on moderating content prior to his takeover. When he announced that he was taking over Twitter in April last year, Mr Musk said ""free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated"".  More recently, the firm that owns Twitter announced that it was suing an anti-hate organisation whose research criticised the platform.  The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) had done research that showed hate and disinformation was ""spreading like wildfire on the platform under Musk's ownership"".

171,Elon Musk: What it's like to interview the billionaire Twitter boss,BBC,2023-04-12,"Over the weekend I decided to drop Elon Musk an email.

He'd just added a label on Twitter to a BBC account saying ""government funded media"". I thought I'd send him a link to how the BBC is funded - predominantly through the licence fee. ""Is the Twitter label accurate?"" was the response I got which came from Mr Musk, rather than a media team.  My editor suggested I have a bash at asking for an interview. Why not have a go, we thought. On Tuesday lunchtime I typed an email, requesting a chat about his first six months as Twitter boss. To my surprise, he responded.  ""Sure, how about tonight?"" he said. I wasn't totally sure if he was being serious. I prepped for the interview, hoping it would happen - but wondering if it actually would. The curveball came just before the interview - when Elon Musk's team insisted the interview should be live on Twitter Spaces.  We responded saying if Twitter Spaces was going to be live, then we'll put it on the BBC channel too. ""Cool,"" he said.  According to his team, more than 3 million people logged in to listen on Twitter Spaces.  Straight off the bat, it was clear he was going to answer my questions. ""Did you buy Twitter because a court was going to force you to?"" I asked.  He replied: ""Yeah, yeah I did"". It was a startlingly frank answer - which set the tone for the interview.  A court may have forced Mr Musk to buy Twitter, because he made an offer for the social media platform then backed out of the deal.  The previous owners and Elon Musk were set to face off in court but before that happened, the billionaire made a surprise U-Turn and bought the platform.  It's the first time Mr Musk has admitted that, even when he walked into Twitter with that sink - all in smiles - he didn't really want it to happen. He'd rather have not bought the company.  Since he has taken over Twitter, he has laid off large swathes of his workforce and made what many see as unorthodox business decisions including introducing paid-for-verification. Many also say Twitter has become a more dangerous platform for users without enough appropriate moderation. The billionaire loves chaos and messing with the media. Several times it felt like he was trying to interview me.  Asking him whether Twitter had become a more hateful place, Mr Musk pushed me to try and name specific examples I'd seen. He was enjoying it at this point. The BBC has previously documented that misinformation is a problem on the platform, yet Mr Musk disagreed.  I pointed out that you can't have it both ways - a platform that allows people to post what they wish without being censored, surely also disseminates misinformation?  But Mr Musk claimed reducing bots, which he says he is doing, will reduce misinformation. This felt like his weakest answer.   This video can not be played Watch: Elon Musk's unexpected BBC interview... in 90 seconds We covered all sorts of subjects: from misinformation and the challenges of artificial intelligence to his love life and whether it was lonely to be a billionaire. He told me he'd often be swarmed by men at parties talking about projects - and that it was hard to trust people.  His answers were also, at times, absurd. In one moment he told me his dog runs the company. While he wriggled out of some questions, there were many questions he took the time to consider.  For example, when I asked him whether he believed TikTok should be banned. He told me that while that would be good for Twitter - one less competitor - he was generally against banning things.  I was expecting at the end of the interview for him to leave as I asked him for ""one more question"", but he did nothing of the sort. The interview, initially slated to be 30 minutes, ended up running for about 90 minutes. At the end he said his goodbyes and went to his office to work. ""I usually go to sleep between 3am and 6am,"" he said.  As he disappeared we reflected on a whirlwind of an interview - and how none of this would have happened if I hadn't sent that email.

""Why take a recognised ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-66296468,"This video can not be played Watch: Twitter HQ sign change halted as police arrive One of the most recognisable logos on the web, the tweeting blue bird, is no more. Will the black and white X replacing it prove to be a masterstroke or a branding disaster? When Jean-Pierre Dube saw the news that billionaire Elon Musk was scrapping Twitter's logo in favour of an Art Deco-style X, the marketing professor thought it was a joke. ""Why take a recognised brand, with a lot of brand capital around it and then completely throw it away and start from scratch?"" said Prof Dube, who teaches at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. ""In the short-term, it seems weird.""  But in the long term, could it work? Mr Musk's takeover of Twitter last year has been punishing for the social media platform. Advertising revenue has dropped by half, Mr Musk said this month, as big brands pulled back, wary of changes he has made, including how the firm handles verified accounts and moderates content. Abrupt layoffs and unpaid bills have also led to bad press and lawsuits. Estimates by Fidelity, which has a stake in the company, suggest it is now worth just a third of the $44bn (Â£34.3bn) that Mr Musk paid for Twitter in October.   Consultancy Brand Finance recently estimated that the firm's brand was worth $3.9bn, down 32% since last year - a fall it attributed to Mr Musk's ""aggressive business approaches"". Research suggests that rebrands can pay off - particularly if a firm is in trouble or wants to change direction, said Yanhui Zhao, a professor of marketing at the University of Nebraska Omaha. His review of 215 rebranding announcements by publicly listed companies found that more than half of those businesses saw positive returns after they rebranded. That means Mr Musk's moves could be timely, he said, noting the multi-billionaire's ambition to transform Twitter into an ""everything app"" similar to China's WeChat, a social messaging service on which users can send money, hail taxis, book hotels and play games, among other functions. ""This is a much needed rebranding because of the strategic re-direction of Twitter,"" he told the BBC. But success becomes less likely when a company is in turmoil, warned Shuba Srinivasan, marketing professor at Boston University's Questrom School of Business. She said it was an especially risky move, given all the social media competitors, such as Mark Zuckerberg's Threads, rushing to fill Twitter's role. ""The rebranding is likely to confirm the fear of many Twitter users that the acquisition by Musk signalled the end of the Twitter they knew,"" she said. Nor is it clear that a rebranding addresses Twitter's problems - many of which stem in part from Mr Musk, Prof Dube said. ""I didn't think there was a brand problem and brand identity problem as much as a leadership problem,"" he said. This video can not be played Designer behind bird logo says it's a sad day In a May interview with satire site, The Babylon Bee, Mr Musk previewed the change, saying he thought he needed to ""broaden the branding for Twitter"" to help him succeed at pushing the company beyond the short text posts that made it famous. But some analysts said that the potential of this vision being successful faces long odds. In June, advisory firm Forrester Research published a report called ""The super app window has closed,"" which argued that tech giants such as Google and Apple currently offer super app-like functions to billions of users in the US and Europe, while tough regulatory hurdles and fierce competition limits opportunities for others. It noted that WeChat, the example that has been cited by Mr Musk, became dominant in China early, before other payment services emerged - and in part as a result of technical issues, such as limited phone memory, which discouraged downloading multiple apps. ""While Musk's vision is to turn X into an 'everything app,' this takes time, money, and people - three things that the company no longer has,"" Mike Proulx, a research director at Forrester, wrote after Mr Musk's announcement, adding that he thought the firm would shut or be be bought out in the next 12 months.  Even if Twitter's core users in media, politics and finance stay loyal, as they have in the past, making X successful would require participation from a far broader user base - no small challenge, said Harvard Business School professor Andy Wu. But Twitter faced difficulties before Mr Musk's takeover and would benefit from some risk-taking, he added.

173,Twitter loses nearly half advertising revenue since Elon Musk takeover,BBC,2023-07-16,"Twitter has lost almost half of its advertising revenue since it was bought by Elon Musk for $44bn (£33.6bn) last October, its owner has revealed. He said the company had not seen the increase in ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-66217641?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Twitter has lost almost half of its advertising revenue since it was bought by Elon Musk for $44bn (Â£33.6bn) last October, its owner has revealed. He said the company had not seen the increase in sales that had been expected in June, but added that July was a ""bit more promising"". Mr Musk sacked about half of Twitter's 7,500 staff when he took over in 2022 in an effort to cut costs.  Rival app Threads now has 150 million users, according to some estimates. Its in-built connection to Instagram automatically gives the Meta-designed platform access to a potential two billion users.  Meanwhile, Twitter is struggling under a heavy debt load. Cash flow remains negative, Mr Musk said at the weekend, although the billionaire did not put a time frame on the 50% drop in ad revenue. In a tweet he said: ""Need to reach positive cash flow before we have the luxury of anything else."" Lucy Coutts, investment director at JM Finn, told the BBC's Today programme she thought Mr Musk would be able to turn Twitter around ""but it is just going to take longer"". ""But unfortunately he has got $13bn of debt to pay by the end of July so we may see more pressure on the shares in Tesla if he has to sell more of his stake in that company."" Mr Musk is also the chief executive and majority shareholder of electric car-maker Tesla, which will report its latest quarterly financial results on Wednesday. After laying off thousands of employees and cutting cloud service bills, Mr Musk said Twitter was on track to post $3bn (Â£2.29bn) in revenue in 2023, down from $5.1bn in 2021. The development is the latest sign the aggressive cost-cutting measures have not been enough to ignite a return of advertisers who fled after changes to its content moderation rules. That is despite an interview Mr Musk gave to the BBC in April, in which he suggested that most had returned to the site. However, Meghana Dhar, the former head of partnerships at Snap and Meta, which owns the new Twitter rival Threads, said the company had been struggling prior to Mr Musk's buyout.  ""Elon and Twitter are in a candidly tough position right now,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. ""To be fair to Elon though, we've seen that decline in Twitter revenue and growth in revenue since pre-Elon - there's been kind of a steady decline.""  Linda Yaccarino, previously head of advertising at NBCUniversal, was taken on as chief executive of Twitter in June - a move suggesting advertising sales are still a priority for the company. Ms Yaccarino has said Twitter plans to focus on video, creator and commerce partnerships. It is said to be in early talks with political and entertainment figures, payments services, and news and media publishers. Why is Twitter limiting how many tweets you can see?

174,Zuckerberg says Musk 'not serious' about cage fight,BBC,2023-08-14,"Elon Musk ""isn't serious"" about holding a cage fight and ""it's time to move on"", Mark Zuckerberg has said. In a post on his social media site Threads, the Meta boss said he had offered Mr Musk ""a ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-66494113,"Elon Musk ""isn't serious"" about holding a cage fight and ""it's time to move on"", Mark Zuckerberg has said. In a post on his social media site Threads, the Meta boss said he had offered Mr Musk ""a real date"" but the rival entrepreneur had made excuses.  Mr Musk had earlier on Sunday suggested on his own messaging site X, formerly known as Twitter, that he was willing to fight as early as Monday.  The billionaires agreed to the bout in June, sparking huge media attention. But despite egging each other on for months, the rivals have yet to secure a date, raising doubts the fight will ever go ahead.  The war of words was complicated by the launch of Threads in July, with the rival messaging app to X attracting more than 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.  That number has fallen back, and X remains comfortably ahead with around 350 million users - but Mr Musk has threatened to sue Facebook for ""unlawful misappropriation of Twitter's trade secrets"". Meta denies the claims.  Last week, Mr Zuckerberg said he had proposed 26 August for the cage fight. Then in a twist on Friday, Italy's culture minister said that he had spoken to Mr Musk about hosting the showdown in the country as a charity event.  Mr Musk suggested it would have ""an ancient Rome theme"". On Sunday, however, the Meta boss posted on Threads: ""Elon won't confirm a date, then says he needs surgery, and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead.  ""If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me. Otherwise, time to move on. I'm going to focus on competing with people who take the sport seriously."" Responding on X, however, Mr Musk called the Meta boss a ""chicken"".  Earlier, Mr Musk had posted a text message exchange on the messaging platform purportedly between himself and Mr Zuckerberg.

In it he tells the Meta boss that he will be in Palo Alto, home to Meta's headquarters, on Monday and that the fight could be held in Mr Zuckerberg's Octagon, which is the eight-sided ring in which cage fights are held. Mr Musk continued: ""I have not been practicing much, apart from a brief bout with Lex Fridman [the computer scientist and podcast host] today. ""While I think it is very unlikely, l given our size difference, perhaps you are a modern day Bruce Lee and will somehow win."" Elon Musk, 52, and Mark Zuckerberg, 39 are two of the world's most high-profile technology billionaires. The bizarre idea to fight each other started in June, when Mr Musk tweeted that he was ""up for a cage fight"" with Mr Zuckerberg.

175,Regulator sues Musk to force testimony in X probe,BBC,2023-10-06,"Financial regulators in the US are suing Elon Musk after the billionaire said he would no longer cooperate with its investigation into his purchase of Twitter, now known as X. The Securities and ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67024538?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Financial regulators in the US are suing Elon Musk after the billionaire said he would no longer cooperate with its investigation into his purchase of Twitter, now known as X. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked a federal court to order him to comply with their request that he sit for a third session of testimony about the deal. The move to sue followed receipt of a letter from a lawyer for Mr Musk, which said he refused to appear as requested. It accused the SEC of ""harassment"".  ""Unchecked government action is dangerous and the record here is troubling. Mr Musk declines to acquiesce in the Commission's incursions and therefore refuses to appear as you demand,"" lawyer Alex Spiro wrote.  The lawsuit is the latest feud between the SEC and Mr Musk, who once declared on national television that he had ""no respect"" for the regulator.  The SEC launched its investigation of Mr Musk's $44bn purchase of X last year.  The filing in San Francisco federal court said the agency is probing whether his 2022 stock purchases before he bought the company outright and statements he made about those investments broke securities laws. Mr Musk participated in two half-days of testimony via video conference in July, after he was subpoenaed, the SEC said. The agency said another session was necessary because nearly half of the documents it had received regarding the case came in after those meetings. A letter from Mr Musk's attorney to the agency, shared as part of the exhibit, said it was ""unclear why the staff requires further time diverting Mr Musk from his significant obligations to companies and shareholders...Enough is enough"".  The SEC has locked horns with Mr Musk before.  In 2018, it charged him with defrauding investors by claiming in a Tweet that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla, the electric car company he leads, private.  He later settled the charges, stepping down as chairman of the firm's board and agreeing to accept what was dubbed a Twitter sitter - limits on what he could write on social media about the company.  Mr Musk has repeatedly gone to court to have those limits removed, including most recently in February. Separately, a judge in New York ruled this week that Mr Musk must face a lawsuit from former Twitter investors who claim he defrauded former shareholders by failing to promptly disclose his share purchases, but an insider trading claim was dismissed.

It says the code was posted on GitHub, a Microsoft-owned service where software developers share code. It has now been taken down after Twitter requested its removal. Separately, Mr Musk has reportedly signalled to Twitter workers that the firm is worth less than half the $44bn (Â£36bn) he paid for it last year. ""GitHub does not generally comment on decisions to remove content. However, in the interest of transparency, we share every DMCA [Digital Millennium Copyright Act] takedown request publicly,"" a GitHub spokesperson told the BBC. The DMCA was signed into law in the US in 1998. It is aimed at protecting copyrighted material on the internet. In the takedown request, Twitter called on GitHub to provide information on who was behind the account which leaked the code - named FreeSpeechEnthusiast. San Francisco-based Twitter said in the filing that the account had infringed copyrights owned by the company. The leak creates a new challenge for Mr Musk, who has slashed Twitter's workforce by more than a third and faced an exodus of advertisers since buying the platform in October last year. Meanwhile, the Tesla chief executive has reportedly indicated that Twitter is now valued at less than $20bn. The estimate of the company's value was based on Mr Musk's offer of stock grants to staff, according to technology news websites Platformer and the Information, which first reported the story. Mr Musk also reportedly told staff: ""I see a clear, but difficult, path to a >$250B valuation,"" which suggests a more than tenfold increase in Twitter's valuation. In response to a BBC request for comment Twitter's press office email account automatically responded with a poo emoji, an approach that Mr Musk announced in a tweet earlier this month.

179,Elon Musk: Tesla delivers record number of cars after price cuts,BBC,2023-07-03,"Earlier this year, Tesla boss Elon Musk said he believed pursuing higher sales, with lower profits, was the ""right choice"" for the company.

It has lowered prices in markets including the US, UK and China to compete with rival manufacturers. This weekend, major Chinese car makers also reported a surge in sales in June. Earlier this year, Tesla boss Elon Musk said he believed pursuing higher sales, with lower profits, was the ""right choice"" for the company. On Sunday, Tesla said it delivered 466,140 vehicles in the second quarter, which was more than 80% higher than a year earlier. Meanwhile, the company said it had increased vehicle production to nearly 480,000 in the same period. ""Tesla has made a strategic choice to be a volume manufacturer,"" Bill Russo, the founder and chief executive of advisory firm Automobility, told the BBC. ""This was the main contributor to the sales increase, as its mainly higher-volume Model 3 and Model Y benefitted from the price war,"" he added. Dan Ives from investment firm Wedbush Securities told the BBC that ""the price cuts in China have been a smart poker move that was massively successful for Tesla"". China is Tesla's second largest market after North America. The firm been cutting prices in the world's second largest economy, where it faces competition from local electric car makers. Over the weekend, Beijing based Li-Auto said its deliveries had hit an all-time high of 32,575 in June, marking its third consecutive monthly sales record. Meanwhile, deliveries by Shanghai-based Nio and Guangzhou-based Xpeng jumped to 10,707 and 8,620 respectively during the month. Tesla has also been grappling with increased competition in other parts of the world, and the impact of higher borrowing costs for customers. It has responded by cutting prices this year. In April, Tesla said it had no plans to stabilise the prices of its vehicles, even though repeated price cuts had dented profits. ""We're not 'starting a price war', we're just lowering prices to enable affordability at scale,"" Mr Musk wrote on his social media platform, Twitter. At the time Tesla said that its overall revenue had risen by almost a quarter in the first quarter from a year ago, as car sales increased. However, its profit for the same period dropped by 24%, because of price cuts and higher costs of raw materials and other commodities. The company is due to report its financial results for the second quarter on 19 July.

Mr Musk is a self-described ""free speech absolutist"" and has been vocal in his criticisms of the platform's policies on moderating content prior to his takeover.

In the story's latest twist, Italy's culture minister on Friday said that he had spoken to Mr Musk about hosting the showdown as a charity event. The billionaire CEOs of Tesla and Meta (formerly Facebook) have been goading each other into the fight since June. If it goes ahead, millions are expected to be donated to children's hospitals. However, Mr Zuckerberg has said no date has been agreed so far. Detailing his vision on social media platform X (previously known as Twitter), Mr Musk said he had spoken to both Italy's prime minister and its culture minister. ""They have agreed on an epic location,"" he wrote. ""Everything in camera frame will be ancient Rome, so nothing modern at all."" However the capital Rome, and its iconic Colosseum - where legendary Gladiator fights were held in ancient times - have been ruled out. Italy's Culture Minister Gennaro Sangiuliano said in a statement that the ""great charity"" event would resonate with the country's historical significance while also preserving its cultural heritage. ""I had a long and friendly conversation with Elon Musk, we talked about our shared passion for ancient Roman history,"" Mr Sangiuliano said in a statement. ""We are thinking about how to organise a great charity and historical evocation event, respecting, and fully protecting the setting... It will not take place in Rome."" Mr Sangiuliano also said that a ""substantial amount, many millions of euros"" is expected to be donated to two Italian children's hospitals as a result of hosting the cage match. Writing on Threads, the platform seen as a direct competitor to X, which he launched last month, Mark Zuckerberg said he has ""been ready to fight since the day Elon challenged me"", and if a date was ever agreed, ""you'll hear it from me"".  ""Until then, please assume anything he says has not been agreed on.""  Seeming to take a dig at the floated plans, Mr Zuckerberg said that when he competes, he wants ""to do it in a way that puts a spotlight on the elite athletes at the top of the game"".  ""You do that by working with professional (organisations) like the UFC or ONE [mixed martial arts organisations] to pull this off well and create a great card,"" he said.

The X boss said users will still be able to block people from directly messaging them, however. But many people on social media said it will make it hard for people to remove abusive posts from their timeline. It is the latest in a series of changes Mr Musk has made since taking over the site in a $44bn deal last year. Currently, when users ""block"" an account, it stops that account's posts from appearing in the blocker's timeline, and vice versa. An account that is blocked can no longer send messages to the blocker, nor can it view their posts. Former Twitter founder, Jack Dorsey, seemed to agree with Mr Musk's decision, posting: ""100%. Mute only"". But there are concerns that muting an account would not be sufficient protection from cases of harassment, abuse or stalking. The mute function currently only stops notifications about an account's posts. An account that is muted can still view the muter's posts and reply to them. One user called Mr Musk's decision a ""huge mistake"", saying there are ""toxic people"" on the platform whom users simply did not want to interact with in any way. Removing a blocking feature could also potentially violate the terms and conditions of stores like Apple's App Store and Google Play. Both stores have conditions stating that social media apps should allow users facilities to filter harassment or bullying. It could mean X is no longer downloadable from those stores. If the policy goes ahead, it is not clear if all those accounts which are blocked will automatically become unblocked. Users do however have the option to make their account private, hiding their tweets from the public and only allowing accepted followers to view their posts. Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, made a series of changes when he took over the social media site, including sacking the company's top executive team and introducing a charge for the site's ""blue tick"" - or verification - feature. Elon Musk is a prolific poster on X, and he's well known for not always being serious or following through on the many ideas he throws out to his 153 million followers. X itself rarely responds to journalist queries so it's difficult to verify anything he states on behalf of the firm. But, as its owner, he's by default a significant, if unreliable, source. The block button is an established tool for those who feel attacked, bullied or simply want to shut out an account with whom they have a strong disagreement (and X is full of those). Report an account and one of the first bits of advice you get is to either block or mute it while it is investigated. That's not unique to X. Muting an account means you don't see it -  but it still sees you. And being forced to remain visible to someone you are trying to avoid or feel afraid of seems like an unusual move.  Musk has been clear that he wants his ""digital town square"" to be a platform where all voices are heard, but he's running the risk of bumping up against both app store terms and conditions and social media regulations around protecting users from online harms.

184,Zuckerberg 'not holding breath' over Musk cage fight,BBC,2023-08-07,"Following a post on X in which Mr Musk claimed he was training ""throughout the day"", Mr Zuckerberg wrote: ""I'm ready today... but he hasn't confirmed."" The two became direct competitors in July ...",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-66424364,"Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg has said he is ""not holding his breath"" over a proposed cage fight with rival Elon Musk. In a post on the new social media app Threads, Mr Zuckerberg said he had proposed 26 August for the showdown. Following a post on X in which Mr Musk claimed he was training ""throughout the day"", Mr Zuckerberg wrote: ""I'm ready today... but he hasn't confirmed."" The two became direct competitors in July with the launch of Threads. Asked by a Threads user whether the fight had been mutually agreed upon, Mr Zuckerberg responded that is was more like ""funding secured,"" in an apparent reference to posts made by Mr Musk in 2018 when he said the same about plans to take electric car company Tesla into private hands. That deal never happened and led to Mr Musk paying a $20m (Â£15.7m) fine to the US financial markets watchdog, stepping back from being Tesla's chairman and limits put on what he can tweet about Tesla. Mr Musk cast further doubt about the potential bout, saying that the ""Exact date is still in flux"", as he may need surgery on his neck and upper back. The social media moguls have been egging each other on in recent months, with Mr Musk claiming on Sunday that their fight would be broadcast live on his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. He said that any proceeds from a match would go to veterans charities. When asked what the point of the bout was by one X user, Mr Musk responded: ""It's a civilized form of war. Men love war."" Mr Zuckerberg also shot back at the suggestion that the fight would be streamed on X, posting: ""Shouldn't we use a more reliable platform that can actually raise money for charity?"" The stakes are seemingly high after Meta, which also owns Instagram and Facebook, launched Threads in early July, drawing in more than 100 million sign-ups within days. However, Mr Zuckerberg later said the platform had lost more than half of its users by the end of last month. Rival social media platform X has faced criticism on several occasions since Mr Musk took over the firm and made a number of changes, such as forcing users to log in to view posts. He also carried out mass firings at the company. Mr Musk posted a message on the social media platform in June claiming he was ""up for a cage fight"" - a fight which typically involves few rules. Mr Zuckerberg then posted a screenshot Mr Musk's tweet with the caption ""send me location"", while Musk responded with: ""Vegas Octagon."" The Octagon is the competition mat and fenced-in area used for Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) bouts. The UFC is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mr Musk, 52, also wrote: ""I have this great move that I call 'The Walrus', where I just lie on top of my opponent & do nothing."" He later tweeted videos of walruses, perhaps suggesting his challenge to the Facebook founder may not have been entirely be serious. Mr Zuckerberg is a martial arts enthusiast and said on Sunday: ""I love this sport and will continue competing with people who train no matter what happens here.""

 Exactly one year has passed since Elon Musk’s $44bn (£36.2bn) splurge on Twitter, now rebranded as ‘X’. During that time, the social media site has undergone an extreme makeover, sparking regular speculation that it is on the brink of extinction. But despite a decline in users and discontent among advertisers, one look at X tells you it is far from dead — even if 16.5m of its users are bots. Meanwhile, prodigies Mastodon and Meta’s Threads, hailed by some as “Twitter Killers”, are yet to slay the giant.  Daily active users (DAUs) now number 225m, as revealed by X’s chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, at Vox Media’s Code 2023 tech conference in September. Twitter had 254.5m DAUs just before Musk’s takeover last October.  Since then, the billionaire’s controversial decisions have included reinstating banned accounts, such as Graham Linehan, opting for a paid subscription service called ‘Twitter Blue,’ and even scrapping the beloved Larry the Bird logo. The most recent change caused a 16 per cent drop in UK DAUs between July and October, from 6.1m to 5.1m, according to data from GWS. Although X is not the only platform facing engagement challenges; Facebook and Snapchat also witnessed declines in DAUs over the same period, by six and 10 per cent, respectively. “The jury is still out on whether Musk’s takeover of Twitter, now X, has been a success,” said Paul Carter, chief executive of GWS.

 “While user figures are down, Musk has been able to hold off the rise of a ‘Twitter killer’ some predicted would arrive, especially with big hitters like Threads launching in recent months.” He continued: “Perhaps most importantly for X, our data shows that those who remain are still highly engaged with what the platform has to offer – these loyal users seem to be just as happy to spend their time on X as they were prior to his takeover.”  GWS figures show users who remain on the site are highly engaged, with time spent on the platform up seven per cent to 17.8 minutes per user daily over the last quarter.  But not everyone is optimistic about Musk’s impact, with social media commentator Drew Benvie telling PA News Agency he “couldn’t imagine it going any worse”, especially as misinformation on the platform is rife.  X has struggled to retain advertisers and monthly US ad revenue has plummeted by at least 55 per cent year on year since Musk’s takeover, according to Reuters. So when Mark Zuckerberg’s Threads launched to great fanfare in July, attracting five million sign-ups in the first few hours, some said it hinted at the end of X.  Read more

 The initial boom quickly vanished. GWS found that, in the UK, Threads saw a significant decrease in DAUs, dropping from 772,000 in July 2023 to 322,000 in October 2023.  Zuckerberg gave an update on his latest media venture during an earnings call on Wednesday evening.  He said: “We’re three months in now, and I’m very happy with the trajectory. There are just under 100 million monthly actives at this point, and we’re now getting to the point where we’re going to be focusing on growing the community further.” With the current growth rate, it could achieve the mark of a billion users in “a few more years”, Zuckerberg said. Threads is yet to be made available in the EU. However, monthly active users may be a vague indicator of engagement, as even users who flick the app open once are counted.  “Even with the benefit of instantly being able to pull Instagram contacts into your Threads account, uptake has been slow and users are becoming inactive,” said Jade Fitzgerald, experience design director at Beyond, a digital product agency.

 She explained: “With social media, a lot of the draw is the hit of dopamine and instant gratification that comes from interaction with other users, so it is always less likely that users are going to stick with a platform that isn’t being engaged with. “Without offering something truly unique and highly beneficial, it’s difficult to change user behaviour and build an original following, so the teams behind Threads and Mastodon should be asking themselves how they can create this differentiation.” As of the start of October, the free social networking platform Mastodon had 1.7m active users according to independent site Mastodon Analytics, although it is unclear if this number is daily or monthly.  X boasts nearly 550m monthly active users, Elon Musk said last month.  But despite its popularity with certain groups such as journalists and politicians, Twitter’s profitability concerns may pose long-term sustainability challenges. Lenders who facilitated the $44bn deal expect a loss of around $2bn (£1.6bn) as they struggle to offload the debt, The Wall Street Journal reported this week. Yaccarino is set to discuss the company’s future with bank lenders who facilitated Musk’s acquisition. Read more

184,Regulator sues Musk to force testimony in X probe,BBC,2023-10-05,"Financial regulators in the US are suing Elon Musk after the billionaire said he would no longer cooperate with its investigation into his purchase of Twitter, now known as X. The Securities and ...",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67024538,"Financial regulators in the US are suing Elon Musk after the billionaire said he would no longer cooperate with its investigation into his purchase of Twitter, now known as X. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked a federal court to order him to comply with their request that he sit for a third session of testimony about the deal. The move to sue followed receipt of a letter from a lawyer for Mr Musk, which said he refused to appear as requested. It accused the SEC of ""harassment"".  ""Unchecked government action is dangerous and the record here is troubling. Mr Musk declines to acquiesce in the Commission's incursions and therefore refuses to appear as you demand,"" lawyer Alex Spiro wrote.  The lawsuit is the latest feud between the SEC and Mr Musk, who once declared on national television that he had ""no respect"" for the regulator.  The SEC launched its investigation of Mr Musk's $44bn purchase of X last year.  The filing in San Francisco federal court said the agency is probing whether his 2022 stock purchases before he bought the company outright and statements he made about those investments broke securities laws. Mr Musk participated in two half-days of testimony via video conference in July, after he was subpoenaed, the SEC said. The agency said another session was necessary because nearly half of the documents it had received regarding the case came in after those meetings. A letter from Mr Musk's attorney to the agency, shared as part of the exhibit, said it was ""unclear why the staff requires further time diverting Mr Musk from his significant obligations to companies and shareholders...Enough is enough"".  The SEC has locked horns with Mr Musk before.  In 2018, it charged him with defrauding investors by claiming in a Tweet that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla, the electric car company he leads, private.  He later settled the charges, stepping down as chairman of the firm's board and agreeing to accept what was dubbed a Twitter sitter - limits on what he could write on social media about the company.  Mr Musk has repeatedly gone to court to have those limits removed, including most recently in February. Separately, a judge in New York ruled this week that Mr Musk must face a lawsuit from former Twitter investors who claim he defrauded former shareholders by failing to promptly disclose his share purchases, but an insider trading claim was dismissed.

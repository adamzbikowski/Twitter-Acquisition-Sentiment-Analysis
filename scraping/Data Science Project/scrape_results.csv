Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. Elon Musk went to Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, and then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where he received bachelor’s degrees in physics and economics in 1997. He began graduate school in physics at Stanford University but left after several days to focus on being an entrepreneur. Elon Musk cofounded the electronic payment firm PayPal, and in 2002 he founded SpaceX, a company that makes rockets and spacecraft. He was a major early funder of Tesla, which makes electric cars and batteries, and became its chief executive officer in 2008. He cofounded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company, in 2016. Musk purchased the social media service Twitter in 2022 and renamed it X in 2023. Elon Musk (born June 28, 1971, Pretoria, South Africa) South African-born American entrepreneur who cofounded the electronic-payment firm PayPal and formed SpaceX, maker of launch vehicles and spacecraft. He was also one of the first significant investors in, as well as chief executive officer of, the electric car manufacturer Tesla. In addition, Musk acquired Twitter (later X) in 2022. Musk was born to a South African father and a Canadian mother. He displayed an early talent for computers and entrepreneurship. At age 12 he created a video game and sold it to a computer magazine. In 1988, after obtaining a Canadian passport, Musk left South Africa because he was unwilling to support apartheid through compulsory military service and because he sought the greater economic opportunities available in the United States. Musk attended Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, and in 1992 he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, where he received bachelor’s degrees in physics and economics in 1997. He enrolled in graduate school in physics at Stanford University in California, but he left after only two days because he felt that the Internet had much more potential to change society than work in physics. In 1995 he founded Zip2, a company that provided maps and business directories to online newspapers. In 1999 Zip2 was bought by the computer manufacturer Compaq for $307 million, and Musk then founded an online financial services company, X.com, which later became PayPal, which specialized in transferring money online. The online auction eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Musk was long convinced that for life to survive, humanity has to become a multiplanet species. However, he was dissatisfied with the great expense of rocket launchers. In 2002 he founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to make more affordable rockets. Its first two rockets were the Falcon 1 (first launched in 2006) and the larger Falcon 9 (first launched in 2010), which were designed to cost much less than competing rockets. A third rocket, the Falcon Heavy (first launched in 2018), was designed to carry 117,000 pounds (53,000 kg) to orbit, nearly twice as much as its largest competitor, the Boeing Company’s Delta IV Heavy, for one-third the cost. SpaceX has announced the successor to the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy: the Super Heavy–Starship system. The Super Heavy first stage would be capable of lifting 100,000 kg (220,000 pounds) to low Earth orbit. The payload would be the Starship, a spacecraft designed for providing fast transportation between cities on Earth and building bases on the Moon and Mars. SpaceX also developed the Dragon spacecraft, which carries supplies to the International Space Station (ISS). Dragon can carry as many as seven astronauts, and it had a crewed flight carrying astronauts Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken to the ISS in 2020. The first test flights of the Super Heavy–Starship system launched in 2020. In addition to being CEO of SpaceX, Musk was also chief designer in building the Falcon rockets, Dragon, and Starship. SpaceX is contracted to build the lander for the astronauts returning to the Moon by 2025 as part of NASA’s Artemis space program. Musk had long been interested in the possibilities of electric cars, and in 2004 he became one of the major funders of Tesla Motors (later renamed Tesla), an electric car company founded by entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. In 2006 Tesla introduced its first car, the Roadster, which could travel 245 miles (394 km) on a single charge. Unlike most previous electric vehicles, which Musk thought were stodgy and uninteresting, it was a sports car that could go from 0 to 60 miles (97 km) per hour in less than four seconds. In 2010 the company’s initial public offering raised about $226 million. Two years later Tesla introduced the Model S sedan, which was acclaimed by automotive critics for its performance and design. The company won further praise for its Model X luxury SUV, which went on the market in 2015. The Model 3, a less-expensive vehicle, went into production in 2017 and became the best-selling electric car of all time. Dissatisfied with the projected cost ($68 billion) of a high-speed rail system in California, Musk in 2013 proposed an alternate faster system, the Hyperloop, a pneumatic tube in which a pod carrying 28 passengers would travel the 350 miles (560 km) between Los Angeles and San Francisco in 35 minutes at a top speed of 760 miles (1,220 km) per hour, nearly the speed of sound. Musk claimed that the Hyperloop would cost only $6 billion and that, with the pods departing every two minutes on average, the system could accommodate the six million people who travel that route every year. However, he stated, between running SpaceX and Tesla, he could not devote time to the Hyperloop’s development. Musk joined the social media service Twitter in 2009, and, as @elonmusk, he became one of the most popular accounts on the site, with more than 85 million followers as of 2022. He expressed reservations about Tesla’s being publicly traded, and in August 2018 he made a series of tweets about taking the company private at a value of $420 per share, noting that he had “secured funding.” (The value of $420 was seen as a joking reference to April 20, a day celebrated by devotees of cannabis.) The following month the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for securities fraud, alleging that the tweets were “false and misleading.” Shortly thereafter Tesla’s board rejected the SEC’s proposed settlement, reportedly because Musk had threatened to resign. However, the news sent Tesla stock plummeting, and a harsher deal was ultimately accepted. Its terms included Musk’s stepping down as chairman for three years, though he was allowed to continue as CEO; his tweets were to be preapproved by Tesla lawyers, and fines of $20 million for both Tesla and Musk were levied. Musk was critical of Twitter’s commitment to principles of free speech, in light of the company’s content-moderation policies. Early in April 2022, Twitter’s filings with the SEC disclosed that Musk had bought more than 9 percent of the company. Shortly thereafter Twitter announced that Musk would join the company’s board, but Musk decided against that and made a bid for the entire company, at a value of $54.20 a share, for $44 billion. Twitter’s board accepted the deal, which would make him sole owner of the company. Musk stated that his plans for the company included “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.” In July 2022 Musk announced that he was withdrawing his bid, stating that Twitter had not provided sufficient information about bot accounts and claiming that the company was in “material breach of multiple provisions” of the purchase agreement. Bret Taylor, the chair of Twitter’s board of directors, responded by saying that the company was “committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk.” Twitter sued Musk to force him to buy the company. In September 2022 Twitter’s shareholders voted to accept Musk’s offer. Facing a legal battle, Musk ultimately proceeded with the deal, and it was completed in October. Among Musk’s first acts as Twitter’s owner were to lay off about half the company and to allow users to purchase for $8 a month the blue check-mark verification, which had previously been bestowed by Twitter upon notable figures. In addition, he disbanded Twitter’s content-moderation body and reinstated many banned accounts, most notably that of former U.S. president Donald Trump, which had been suspended after the U.S. Capitol attack on January 6, 2021. Advertising revenue fell sharply as many companies withdrew their ads from the platform. Musk changed the name of the company from Twitter to X in July 2023. (Tweets became posts with the change.)"

Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News          Elon Musk’s implant company Neuralink, which aims to enable brains to connect and communicate with computers, has acknowledged that monkeys died as part of its testing procedures, but denies allegations of animal cruelty.
   
In a blog post on its website, ​Neuralink addressed the “recent articles” that have “raised questions around Neuralink’s use of research animals at the University of California, Davis Primate Center” (UC Davis) and said that “all novel medical devices and treatments must be tested in animals before they can be ethically trialed in humans.”
   
      Macaque monkeys have been used in testing by Neuralink as the company has been developing Bluetooth-enabled implantable chips – inserted into the monkey’s brains – that ​the company says can communicate with computers via a small receiver.
   
      In April last year, Neuralink claimed monkeys can play Pong – a computer game - using just their minds when it released a video of Pager, a male macaque, moving a cursor onscreen without using a joystick to do so.
   
      ​The company said this was achieved after the Neuralink chip fed the information from the monkey’s neurons into a decoder, which was then used to predict Pager’s intended hand movements – allowing the output from the decoder to be used to move the cursor, instead of Pager manipulating the joystick.
   
Elon Musk shows off a working brain implant — in pigs        The statement by Neuralink comes after the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine – a US non-profit ​that advocates alternatives to animal testing – sent a letter to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) referencing violations and requesting an investigation into what it called “apparent egregious violations of the Animal Welfare Act related to the treatment of monkeys used in invasive brain experiments.” 
   
      The document says the experiments were carried out pursuant to contractual agreements between UC Davis and Neuralink. In the letter, which spans more than 700 pages, the Physicians Committee said records it obtained for the 23 monkeys used in the experiments reflect a “pattern of extreme suffering and staff negligence.” The committee said that the letter to the USDA is based on nearly 600 pages of what it calls “disturbing” documents released after the committee filed an initial public records lawsuit in 2021.
   
      The Physicians Committee said in a press release on February 10 that UC Davis received more than $1.4 million in funding from Neuralink to carry out the experiments on the macaque monkeys. 
   
      CNN has contacted UC Davis and the Board of Regents for comment. In a statement to KCRA 3, UC Davis spokesperson Andy Fell said: “The research protocols were thoroughly reviewed and approved by the campus’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).” Fell added: “The work was conducted by Neuralink researchers in facilities at the California National Primate Research Center at UC Davis. UC Davis staff provided veterinary care including round-the-clock monitoring of experimental animals. When an incident occurred, it was reported to the IACUC, which mandated training and protocol changes as needed.”
   
      On February 10, the Physicians Committee ​says they filed a second public records lawsuit to compel the university to release videos and photographs of the monkeys. Neuralink is not part of the lawsuit.
   
      In the lawsuit, the committee alleges that staff at the university “removed pieces of the skulls of rhesus macaque monkeys and inserted electrodes into the animals’ brains.”
   
      The lawsuit alleges that monkeys were not provided with adequate veterinary care and that an “unapproved substance” known as BioGlue “killed monkeys by destroying portions of their brains.”
   
      In Neuralink’s blog, the company said there was “one surgical complication involving the use of the FDA-approved product (BioGlue),” and the monkey was euthanized.
   
Elon Musk's Neuralink claims monkeys can play Pong using just their minds         In the lawsuit, the committee further alleges that the University of California has ​declined to release photos and videos ​of the experiments, saying the records belong to Neuralink, a private company not subject to California’s Public Records Act.
   
      In ​a statement posted to Neuralink’s website, Neuralink said the company is “absolutely committed to working with animals in the most humane and ethical way possible.”
   
      It also said that its “central mission is to design an animal care program prioritizing the needs of the animals, rather than the typical strategy of building for human convenience alone.”
   
      Neuralink said “the use of every animal was extensively planned and considered to balance scientific discovery with the ethical use of animals.” In reference to the claims of ​euthanasia by the Physicians Committee, Neuralink stated that “two animals were euthanized at planned end dates to gather important histological data, and six animals were euthanized at the medical advice of the veterinary staff at UC Davis.”
   
      Neuralink said it ​made the decision to partner with UC Davis in 2017 to conduct animal-based research. In 2020, Musk’s company opened an in-house 6,000-square-foot vivarium to house farm animals and rhesus macaques​, according to Neuralink’s statement.
   
      Neuralink said in the statement that it is “never satisfied with the current standards for animal well being and we will always push ourselves to do more for the animals that are contributing so much to humanity.”
   
      Jeremy Beckham, research advocacy coordinator with the Physicians Committee, said in the press release that documents used by the committee in its letter to the USDA “reveal that monkeys had their brains mutilated in shoddy experiments and were left to suffer and die.”
   
      Neuralink has previously said that the goal of their research was to enable a person with paralysis to be able to use a device like a computer or phone using only brain activity.

Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News          Elon Musk has repeatedly bragged (or, perhaps, complained) that he’ll pay more in federal taxes for 2021 than anyone has ever paid — about $11 billion. But Tesla apparently won’t pay a cent.
   
      Tesla may not plan to pay federal taxes any time in the foreseeable future – even though the company just reported by far its most profitable year ever. In 2021, Tesla recorded net income of $5.5 billion, and adjusted income of $7.6 billion.
   
      But buried in a footnote of its recent annual financial filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla reports that its US operations lost $130 million last year on a pre-tax basis. It claims that all of its pre-tax profits — more than $6 billion worth — came from overseas operations, even though 45% of its revenue came from US sales. 
   
      Although Tesla indicates its foreign tax bill came to $839 million, its state tax bill was only $9 million. And its federal tax bill was zero.
   
      “That defies common sense, but it does not defy the US tax code,” said Martin Sullivan, chief economist for Tax Analysts, a nonprofit tax publisher, and an expert on US corporate tax practices.
   
      Sullivan said he believes the $130 million loss on its US operations is most likely due to a common practice for US multinational corporations: structuring their operations so that overseas subsidiaries are the ones reporting income, leaving the US operation to have little or no taxable income to report. 
   
      For example, a company can assign its intellectual property to one of those foreign entities, and charge its US unit a fee for using that property. And thus, the foreign operation is very profitable, while the US company — burdened with “costs” to the company itself — reports either a loss or very little income.
   
      “It’s a US multinational thing. It’s very common. It’s almost malpractice not to do that,” said Sullivan.
   
      A recent report from the US Department of the Treasury found 61% of the international profits of US multinational companies are booked in seven small countries – Bermuda, the Caymans, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Singapore and Switzerland – known as tax havens. It’s a practice that many elected officials and the Biden administration have vowed to crack down on. 
   
      “Tesla and other giant corporations have long used scams and loopholes to help them get out of paying taxes – that has to stop,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a frequent critic of Musk. “Democrats are working to end Republican tax cuts for corporations shifting profits and jobs overseas.”
   
      However, Congress has so far failed to take action to stop it.
   
      The financial filing by Tesla doesn’t spell out what it did exactly, though. For example, it doesn’t say which country or countries it made its profit in while reporting a US loss.  And Tesla declined to respond to a question about its filing. 
   
      Considering the substantial financial help that Tesla has long received from government support for its electric cars, the company doesn’t have to use a shell game of offshoring its profits to avoid paying taxes. Instead, it could use past losses to shelter its current income from any tax bill.
   
      Once again, this is a common practice for companies that lose money: losses result in a future tax break. 
   
      Tech companies that lose money for years before turning a profit — such as Amazon
            
                (AMZN) — have used this technique. So have old line companies that have financial problems, such as all US airlines, which will probably not have to pay taxes for years to come after recording billions of dollars in losses during the pandemic — despite receiving billions in federal help. 
   
      Similarly, Tesla’s US automaking competitors lost so much money in the first decade of this century that General Motors and Chrysler needed government bailouts. Despite those bailouts, neither company paid taxes for several years once they were again profitable.
   
      Past losses are a huge and very valuable future tax benefit known as “net operating loss carry-forwards.”
   
      Tesla was losing money for more than a decade before it finally started reporting net income in 2020. Those were real losses, which occurred when the costs of developing and building its cars in its early years far outstripped the money it could sell them for. It did so with the expectation that it would turn a profit in the future as demand increased and costs declined. That’s exactly what happened. 
   
      But, in running up billions of dollars in losses, Tesla was able to accumulate net operating loss carry-forwards that it could use in the future. 
   
      Still, Tesla disclosed in this week’s financial filing that it did not use any of those past losses to shield current income from taxes. And it took a bookkeeping maneuver that suggests it doesn’t know if it will ever have to use those past losses to shield its US income.
   
      Tesla is rather bullish about its future, expecting annual sales growth of 50% for the foreseeable future. If it believed that its pre-tax losses in its domestic operations was temporary, it likely would not have not taken that step of reducing the value of those past losses as a way of eliminating future US taxes, according to Sullivan.
   
      There’s another possible reason that Tesla might have reported a pre-tax loss on its US operations: — one that isn’t as much an accounting maneuver designed to lower taxes as it is a warning sign about the viability of the company. Perhaps it still is losing money on the cars it is selling in the United States, and it can only make money using the lower costs of a relatively new factory in Shanghai, China.
   
      That’s what one of Tesla’s most fervent critics and doubters believes. Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research, points out that Tesla was losing money overall until after it started producing cars in Shanghai in October 2019. He believes that investors are giving Tesla too much credit for profits in the US that he doesn’t believe are real.
   
Tesla says California plans to sue over alleged discrimination, harassment        “I think it’s a massive deal,” he said about Tesla’s filing this week. “They effectively said they don’t plan on utilizing any of the net loss carry forwards. That means their US operations are losing money. It’s an argument we’ve made over and over again. Outside of China, Tesla loses money.”
   
      But other analysts who have examined its books insist Tesla’s profits, both at home and overseas, are real, no matter what its US tax forms say.
   
      Johnson said if he’s wrong, it’s up to Tesla to be more transparent.
   
      “The reality is, until they provide disclosure, both explanations could be right,” he said.
   
      Musk has a history of using the US tax code to pay little or no personal federal income taxes. A report from ProPublica shows that for 2018 Musk and many other Americans near the top of the world’s richest people paid no income tax.
   
      In Musk’s case, he receives no salary from Tesla, only very valuable stock options, as a form of compensation. And under US tax code he doesn’t have to pay taxes on those options until he exercises them to buy shares of stock at a fraction of their current value.
   
      He also would have to pay taxes if he sells shares he already held because of his earlier investment in the company, which he has rarely done. But he did that last year as well.
   
      Musk has not exercised most of the options that he holds. But he had options to buy 22.9 million shares that were due to expire in August 2022, and started exercising those options to buy additional shares late last year. 
   
      In total, he spent $142.6 million to purchase shares worth $23.6 billion, giving him $23.5 billion in in taxable income, taxable for 2021 at a federal rate of about 41%.
   
      Musk also sold a small fraction of the additional shares he already owned, sales that fetched a taxable $5.8 billion at a lower capital gains rate.
   
      Together those stock trades likely resulted in roughly an $11 billion federal tax bill, which he has tweeted about.
   
      But that could well be the last time for years to come that he’s paying a substantial federal tax, unless Congress passes one of the various proposals to tax the net worth of the nation’s wealthiest individuals, rather than just their income. Several Democratic Senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Ron Wyden have proposed that, but so far it hasn’t come close to passing. 
   
      Not surprisingly, Musk opposes such efforts, and has mocked all three senators on Twitter.
   
      The options Musk exercised last year that produced the massive tax bill aren’t the end of his options. This week’s financial filing from Tesla discloses that Musk received another 8.4 million options, bringing his total to 67.5 million. 
   
      But none of those options expire until 2028. And thus it’ll probably be five years before he starts to exercise those options, unless he leaves the company before then. 
   
      If he is once again paying zero federal taxes, chances are good that his tax bill and his primary company’s tax bill will be the same during those five years.

                                           Craig Trudell, Bloomberg News (Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk apparently isn’t pleased with pressure the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration exerted on Tesla Inc. to conduct its 11th recall of U.S. vehicles in just over three months. Asked by a Twitter follower on Saturday what the rationale was for recalling a feature called Boombox, which enabled people to play sounds through an external speaker of their vehicle, Tesla’s chief executive officer replied: “The fun police made us do it (sigh).” Tesla told NHTSA on Feb. 4 that it would disable Boombox when its vehicles are in drive, neutral or reverse, to comply with a safety standard requiring electric cars to emit sounds that alert pedestrians. In its recall report, the company said NHTSA asked for information in January 2021 to investigate whether the feature complied with the safety standard. Tesla decided to conduct a voluntary recall after months of back-and-forth with the agency, according to the report. Musk has repeatedly clashed with U.S. regulators, directing much of his ire in recent years at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He has said he does not respect the SEC and has come up with derisive and profane plays on the agency’s initials since it charged him with securities fraud over his August 2018 claims to have secured funding to take Tesla private.  In April 2018, Musk hung up on the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board over a dispute related to a fatal crash involving a Tesla operating on Autopilot. NHTSA opened a defect investigation into Autopilot in August, saying it would assess the technologies and methods Tesla uses to monitor and assist drivers and enforce their engagement with the system. The probe was precipitated by roughly a dozen incidents in which Teslas operating on Autopilot collided with vehicles at crash scenes, including first responders. Weeks after NHTSA opened the investigation, Tesla deployed an over-the-air update to its cars aimed at improving their detection of emergency vehicles and neglected to file a recall notice. NHTSA asked the company whether it intended to file a safety recall, and if not, to provide technical and legal justification. At the same time, NHTSA scrutinized Tesla’s plans to expand the availability of Full Self-Driving, or FSD, the controversially named suite of features that still requires a fully attentive driver with hands on the wheel. Two of the 11 recalls Tesla has filed since October were related to FSD. NHTSA’s actions suggest regulatory pressure is rising on technology that Musk has said played a critical role in making Tesla the world’s most valuable automaker. The CEO tweeted in September that investors were giving the company “significant credit” for its self-driving capabilities. ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.

SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk is captured this Dec. 1, 2020, file photo, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a vocal union opponent, is now inviting the United Autoworkers to organize his company in an attempt to goad the labor union.  Musk tweeted Thursday that he's able to maintain the Tesla workforce because the company compensates and treats its employees well. Because of this, Musk claimed, he's not worried about union organizing at his company.  ""I'd like hereby to invite UAW to hold a union vote at their convenience. Tesla will do nothing to stop them,"" he tweeted. Musk was responding to a series of tweets by KISS leader Gene Simmons, who was criticizing President Biden for not mentioning Tesla, a luxury electric carmaker, in his State of the Union address earlier this week. In it, Biden touted Ford and GM's efforts at building electric vehicles. Both automakers are unionized.  Simmons said ""The President doesn't mention Tesla, perhaps because Tesla is non-union and moved to Texas, a 'right to work' state. Give Elon Musk/Tesla its due. They are game changers and should be heralded."" Musk responded, saying Tesla hasn't closed its Fremont, Calif., location and has plans of expanding. He went on to say later that Tesla factory workers' compensation, which includes stock options, is the highest in the auto industry. A spokesman for the UAW declined to comment on Musk's tweets, but referred NPR to an ongoing case in front of the National Labor Relations Board involving Tesla and Musk. Musk's message to the United Autoworkers comes after years of organizing attempts at the Fremont facility. Since 2017, unfair labor practice charges have been filed against Tesla at the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency in charge of enforcing labor laws and monitoring union organizing drives.  Musk previously got into legal trouble for a tweet he sent in 2018 saying workers could lose their stock options if they unionized. This message was seen as a threat by workers, union activists and a California labor judge. The judge ruled Musk's tweets to be an illegal action against employees' rights to organize. The UAW and the NLRB has also cited Tesla and Musk for previously firing workers involved in organizing activities, and for other claims.  Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor"

Musk's offer values Twitter at about $43 billion. ""I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,"" Musk wrote in a letter sent to Twitter Chairman Bret Taylor and disclosed in a securities filing. Twitter shares closed down 1.68% on Thursday. Tesla's stock dipped more than 3.6% on the news. According to Musk, the social media company needs to go private because it can ""neither thrive nor serve"" free speech in its current state. ""As a result, I am offering to buy 100% of Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, a 54% premium over the day before I began investing in Twitter and a 38% premium over the day before my investment was publicly announced,"" he wrote. ""My offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder."" Musk tapped Morgan Stanley as a financial advisor, according to the filing. He claimed later on Thursday during a talk at TED2022 that he isn't interested in acquiring Twitter to make money off it and even said he's not sure if he'll even be able to buy the company. Citi is bullish about a part of the semiconductor sector, names top stock picks Growth investor is underweight the Magnificent Seven, but likes one tech giant Goldman Sachs updates its 'directors' cut' list of top Europe stocks with major upside  Bonds or stocks? Wall Street prefers one, and says how to invest ""This is not a way to sort of make money... it's just that I think my strong, intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive, is extremely important to the future of civilization,"" Musk said at TED2022. ""But yeah, I don't care about the economics at all."" He also said during the talk that he would try to retain as many shareholders as possible for a private company. The news comes just days after Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal warned investors of ""distractions ahead."" ""The Twitter Board of Directors will carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the Company and all Twitter stockholders,"" the company said in a statement Thursday in response to the offer. CNBC's David Faber reported on ""Squawk on the Street"" that Twitter's board will meet at 10 a.m. to evaluate the bid, per people familiar. Musk first disclosed his stake in the social media giant on April 4. He later landed a seat on the company's board of directors before reversing those plans. The Tesla CEO has previously criticized the social media giant publicly, polling people on Twitter last month about whether the company abides by free speech principles. He also said he was considering building a new social media platform. Shares of Twitter have seesawed in recent weeks amid the news from Musk, but are up 6% this year and 18.5% since the start of the month. Here is the letter Musk sent as disclosed in a securities filing: I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy. However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company. As a result, I am offering to buy 100% of Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, a 54% premium over the day before I began investing in Twitter and a 38% premium over the day before my investment was publicly announced. My offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder. Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it. Elon Musk Later on Thursday, Agrawal reportedly told employees in a staff meeting that the company is evaluating the offer. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Mr Musk, who made the shock bid less than two weeks ago, said Twitter had ""tremendous potential"" that he would unlock. He also called for a series of changes from relaxing its content restrictions to eradicating fake accounts. The firm initially rebuffed Mr Musk's bid, but it will now ask shareholders to vote to approve the deal. Mr Musk is the world's richest person, according to Forbes magazine, with an estimated net worth of $273.6bn mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla which he runs. He also leads the aerospace firm SpaceX. ""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" Mr Musk said in a statement announcing the deal.  ""I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans,"" he added.  ""Twitter has tremendous potential - I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The move comes as Twitter faces growing pressure from politicians and regulators over the content that appears on its platform. It has drawn critics from left and right over its efforts to mediate misinformation on the platform. In one of its most high-profile moves, last year it banned former US President Donald Trump, perhaps its most powerful user, citing the risk of ""incitement of violence"".  At the time Mr Musk observed: ""A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech."" News of the takeover has been cheered by the right in the US, although Mr Trump on Monday told Fox News he had no plans to re-join the platform. The White House declined to comment on the takeover but spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters: ""No matter who owns or runs Twitter, the president has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms."" On Twitter, MP Julian Knight, chairman of the UK's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, called the deal an ""extraordinary development in the world of social media"".  ""It will be interesting to see how a privately owned Twitter (run by a man who is an absolutist over free speech) will react to global moves to regulate."" BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin says scientists are nervous about the potential impact of the takeover on the climate debate.  He notes that Twitter announced last week it would ban advertisements that deny the scientific consensus on the climate crisis, with the firm admitting that misleading information can undermine efforts to protect the planet. Mr Musk, who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter, has a controversial history on the platform himself. In 2018 US financial regulators accused him of misleading Tesla investors with his tweets, claims that were resolved in a $40 million settlement and that Mr Musk continues to deny. And in 2019 he was hit with a defamation suit - which he successfully defeated - after calling a diver involved in rescuing schoolboys in Thailand ""pedo guy"" on the platform.  On Monday, Mr Musk, who has been known to clash with journalists and block critics, suggested that he saw Twitter as a forum for debate. ""I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,"" he wrote just hours before the deal was announced. As part of the takeover, which is expected to close later this year, Twitter's shares will be delisted and it will be taken private.  Mr Musk has suggested this will give him freedom to make the changes he wants to the business.   Among other ideas, he has suggested allowing longer posts and introducing the ability to edit them after they have been published. Twitter shares on Monday closed more than 5% higher after the deal was announced.  But the price remained lower than Mr Musk's $54.20 per share offer, a sign that Wall Street believes he is overpaying for the firm. Mr Musk has said he doesn't ""care about the economics"" of the purchase. However, he will take on a company with a chequered record of financial performance. Despite its influence, Twitter has rarely turned a profit and user growth, particularly in the US, has slowed.  The company, founded in 2004, ended 2021 with $5bn in revenue and 217 million daily users globally - a fraction of the figures claimed by other platforms such as Facebook. Bret Taylor, chair of Twitter's board, said it had fully assessed Mr Musk's offer and it was ""the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders"". It is not clear who will lead the company moving forward. Twitter is currently led by Parag Agrawal, who took over from co-founder and former boss Jack Dorsey last November. But in his offer document, Mr Musk told Twitter's board: ""I don't have confidence in management."" Mr Agrawal told employees on Monday that the future of Twitter is uncertain. ""Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go,"" he said, according to the Reuters news agency.  Mr Musk's targeting of Twitter has moved at remarkable speed. It emerged at the beginning of April that he had become the largest shareholder in the firm with a 9.2% stake. He was then invited to join Twitter's board but turned down the offer before launching a surprise bid for the company on 14 April, saying he wanted to ""unlock"" its potential as a bastion of freedom of speech. Twitter tried to fend off his bid, threatening to dilute the shareholdings of anyone who bought more than a 15% stake in the firm. However, its stance shifted after Mr Musk revealed more financial details about his proposed bid.  He has secured $25.5bn of financing for the deal and will take a $21bn stake in the business.  The board unanimously approved the bid, which will now be presented to shareholders for a vote.  The speed this move has happened at had many heads in Silicon Valley spinning.  From nowhere, Elon Musk is the absolute monarch of Twitter.  He himself has said it's not about the ""economics"", this is about power and influence.  By taking the company private he will exercise total control over Twitter.  He has the power to do with the company as he pleases. In practice that will mean a much lighter moderation policy.  He also says that he will make its algorithm public - so that people can better understand how Twitter works.  The move leaves the door open to Donald Trump's return to the platform, though he apparently says he would rather use his own social media platform Truth Social for now.  For years conservatives have argued that Twitter is biased against them - and the news has left Republicans in the US delighted.  Others have been left dismayed at what Twitter might look like without strong platform moderation.  You only need to look at how much criticism Facebook has received for not taking down groups linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory, or the Stop the Steal movement to imagine how much criticism Elon Musk is in store for.  The danger that Twitter now faces is that unfettered free speech on social media can become very ugly, very quickly.  This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk?

Twitter on Monday announced it has accepted billionaire Elon Musk's bid to takeover the social media company for $44 billion. Elon Musk will soon hold the keys to Twitter. The company announced on Monday that it has accepted the Tesla CEO's $44 billion offer to take the company private. That means the world's richest person who has a penchant for theatrics and erratic behavior is about to have the power to reshape discourse on a social network used by more than 200 million people every day. How might Musk wield that power?  Here are some proposals for Twitter that he's floated. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO describes himself as a ""free speech absolutist"" and has criticized what he sees as excessive moderation on online platforms.  He nodded to these beliefs in his statement announcing the purchase by saying that ""free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated."" Musk has argued that social networks should not remove comments that, while offensive, are still legal. During a recent interview at a TED conference he said, ""If it's a gray area, let the tweet exist."" Twitter currently bans harassment, abuse and posts that wish physical harm to someone. The platform has other guardrails too, like a prohibition on misinformation related to COVID-19. Experts who study social networks fret about Musk's push to loosen the rules of engagement on Twitter. They say that could give license to harassers, trolls and others who abuse the platform to target people.  They also worry relaxing the rules on Twitter will empower those looking to exploit the platform by spreading misinformation, or flat-out lies, about political events, government officials and matters related to public health and safety.  One of the most requested product changes among Twitter users is an edit button.  Unlike Facebook, Instagram and other social media apps, it is not possible to change content on Twitter once it's published. Musk has said he supports letting people change what their tweets say, a proposal that has stirred a heated debate among academics, journalists and other heavy users of the platform. The fear among experts is that adding an edit button feature would be weaponized by bad actors, who could use it to cover up abuse or harassment as if it never happened, or to dupe or manipulate people.  But others say safeguards could be put in place so that tweets could be edited to clean up typos, while also showing a history of how the tweet was edited to preserve the original content.  Musk has said that the software that determines what people see and how widely content spreads on Twitter should be cracked open. He supports placing Twitter's algorithm on GitHub, a site popular with programmers for sharing computer code.  While some advocates of more transparency at social media companies say the that could be a step towards greater openness, others say revealing Twitter's dense and complicated algorithm to the public would accomplish very little. Furthermore, allowing anyone to see Twitter's algorithm could give spammers and malicious actors a way to exploit the system.  Then there's the fact that a social network the size of Twitter processes billions of pieces of content every day. How and why tweets go viral, and how Twitter's recommendation system works, is so dense and complex that the company's own software engineers can be perplexed trying to understand its logic. And without the underlying user data, which would not be public, the algorithm alone would likely provide few clues about how ranking works at Twitter.  Combating the proliferation of bots on Twitter — fake accounts that are programmed to respond to tweets on certain topics — is another change Musk favors.  Musk's business empire has been known to attract is fair share of bots, including bots supportive of his electric car company Tesla that attack Musk critics.  He has not said he would like to temper those kind of bots, but he has suggested that there should be a crackdown on scammy bots promoting cryptocurrency hustles. ""If our twitter bid succeeds, we will defeat the spam bots or die trying!"" Musk tweeted last week, adding that he'd like to ""authenticate all real humans.""  It should be noted that Twitter already has strong rules against spam, and it bans things like attempting to artificially influence conversations on the platform with fake accounts and bots, so the question remains how exactly Musk would strengthen an already robust anti-spam policy? Right now, almost 90% of Twitter's revenue comes from advertising, but the company has struggled to attract advertisers to the platform, which often devolves into political firestorms and ugly online brawls. With the company going private, it will not be under the same pressure from shareholders to continually grow advertising revenue. Musk has said it should move to a subscription model. Twitter has already taken some steps in that direction with the introduction last year of Twitter Blue, a premium service that cost $2.99 a month for addition features, like an undo button that allows for tweets to be recalled before they are sent.  Musk has said Twitter Blue should be cheaper, that if people are paying, they shouldn't have to see advertisements and that the cryptocurrency that started as a joke, Dogecoin, should be an acceptable form of payment for a Twitter subscription.  Musk has not publicly said whether he would allow former President Donald Trump back on the platform after the company permanently suspended him for rhetoric that broke its rules and stoked the siege on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.  In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Trump called Musk ""a good man,"" saying he was pleased with the billionaire's acquisition, but Trump said he has no plans to try to return to the Twitter. Instead, Trump said he will be focusing on his alternative social network known as Truth Social. At an all-hands meeting on Monday afternoon, a Twitter employee asked CEO Parag Agrawal whether Trump would be reinstated. Agrawal said that was a question for Musk. ""Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go,"" he said. NPR's Shannon Bond contributed to this report. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor"

Elon Musk buys Twitter for approximately $44 billion ... Elon Musk is buying Twitter and taking it private. Twitter's board of directors ..."," Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time Elon Musk is buying Twitter and taking it private.  Twitter's board of directors unanimously agreed to Musk's offer to purchase the social media platform at a price of $44 billion, the company announced Monday.  The deal brings arguably the internet's most influential platform under the control of one of the world's richest people. Musk, a prolific Twitter user, has repeatedly decried efforts to moderate speech on the service.  “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said in a statement posted to Twitter. “I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans. Twitter has tremendous potential — I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.” Twitter stockholders will receive $54.20 in cash for each share of Twitter common stock once the transaction closes. It's a 38 percent  premium to Twitter’s closing stock price on April 1 — the last trading day before Musk disclosed his approximately 9 percent stake in Twitter. “The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon’s proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing,” said Twitter board chair Bret Taylor in a statement. “The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.”  It was first revealed in early April that Musk had acquired a 9 percent stake in Twitter, making him one of the company's biggest shareholders. Since then, Musk and the company had engaged in something of a corporate battle over the future of the company, with Musk briefly agreeing to join the board, later announcing an acquisition offer, and Twitter looking to stop Musk's acquisition with a corporate maneuver known as a ""poison pill,"" which is meant to block takeover efforts. The poison pill was seen as a stop-gap measure to prevent Musk from purchasing the social media platform. The ""pill,"" known as a shareholder rights plan, would have prevented Musk from purchasing more than 15 percent of Twitter shares on the open market by triggering a provision to allow Twitter to sell more shares, diluting the value of Musk's holdings.  But on April 20, Musk filed a securities document showing he had obtained financing agreements worth $46.5 billion from a group of banks led by Morgan Stanley to complete a potential transaction. That may have put pressure on Twitter’s board to more seriously consider Musk's bid.  Twitter shares had lost some 17 percent of their value between the time current CEO Parag Agrawal was announced as the social media platform's newest chief and April 14, when Musk revealed his outsized ownership stake.   Jack Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter and was its CEO until stepping down in November, celebrated the move, saying that the company ""has been owned by Wall Street and the ad model"" and that ""taking it back is correct first step."" ""In principle, I don’t believe anyone should own or run Twitter,"" Dorsey said. ""It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company."" He called Musk the ""singular solution"" to that problem and said: ""Elon’s goal of creating a platform that is 'maximally trusted and broadly inclusive' is the right one."" Lauri Brunner, senior portfolio manager for financial services group Thrivent’s large cap growth fund, which holds about $160 million-worth of Twitter shares, told NBC that given his record at Tesla, Musk would be able to serve as a ""catalyst"" for delivering strong performance at Twitter. Thrivent is also a Tesla shareholder.  ""I think that Elon is very transparent about his plans and his strategy,"" Brunner said.  In a statement following news of the acquisition, Derrick Johnson, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, struck a cautious tone. ""Do not allow Twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech, or falsehoods that subvert our democracy,"" Johnson said in part. ""Protecting our democracy is of utmost importance, especially as the midterm elections approach. Mr. Musk: lives are at risk, and so is American democracy.” Jason Abbruzzese is the senior editor for technology, science and climate for NBC News Digital.

Twitter said Monday it has agreed to sell itself to Elon Musk in a roughly $44 billion deal that has the potential to expand the ...","Markets   
Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News          Twitter said Monday it has agreed to sell itself to Elon Musk in a roughly $44 billion deal that has the potential to expand the billionaire’s business empire and put the world’s richest man in charge of one of the world’s most influential social networks.
   
      The deal, which will take the company private, caps off a whirlwind period in which the Tesla and SpaceX CEO became one of Twitter’s largest shareholders, was offered and turned down a seat on its board and bid to buy the company — all in less than a month. 
   
      Under the terms of the deal, shareholders will receive $54.20 in cash for each share of Twitter stock they own, matching Musk’s original offer and marking a 38% premium over the stock price the day before Musk revealed his stake in the company.
   
      “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said in a statement Monday. “Twitter has tremendous potential — I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.”
   
Elon Musk says he has lined up $46.5 billion in financing for Twitter deal        The deal, which was unanimously approved by Twitter’s board, is expected to close this year. It comes after Musk revealed last week he had lined up $46.5 billion in financing to acquire the company, an apparent turning point that forced Twitter’s board to seriously consider the deal. The board met Sunday to evaluate Musk’s offer. 
   
      “The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon’s proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing,” Twitter independent board chair Bret Taylor said in a statement, calling the deal ” the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.” 
   
      Twitter stock was up nearly 6% following the announcement of the deal, hovering around $51.84, just shy of the offer price. The deal is pending approval from shareholders and regulators. 
   
      In an internal message to employees obtained by CNN, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal said he would hold an all-hands meeting with Taylor on Monday afternoon to answer questions about the deal. “I know this is a significant change and you’re likely processing what this means for you and Twitter’s future,” he said.
   
      Musk is both a high-profile Twitter user and a controversial one. He has more than 83 million followers on the platform, which he has used over the years for everything from sharing memes and discussing his companies to insulting politicians, spreading misleading claims about Covid-19 and making offensive remarks about the transgender community. 
   
      Musk has repeatedly stressed in recent days that his goal is to bolster free speech on the platform and work to “unlock” Twitter’s “extraordinary potential.” 
   
Send a tip: Do you have information to share about this story? We offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.  
      In his statement Monday, Musk said he wants to “make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.” Separately, he said in a tweet Monday that he hopes “even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.”
   
      Still, some industry experts worry that Musk’s desire for free speech on Twitter could mean rolling back some of the platform’s work to curb hate speech, misinformation, harassment and other harmful content. Others questioned whether Musk might restore former President Donald Trump’s account, which was removed early last year for violating Twitter policies against inciting violence following the Capitol Riot. Such a move could have significant ramifications for the upcoming 2024 US presidential election.
   
      While Twitter is smaller than some social media rivals, it has an outsized influence in the online and offline worlds because it is used by many politicians, public figures and journalists, and has sometimes acted as a model for other platforms in how to handle harmful content. 
   
      “Do not allow Twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech, or falsehoods that subvert our democracy,” Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, said in a statement directed at Musk Monday following the deal.
   
      In the days since Musk’s initial bid, many following the company wondered whether Twitter would try to find another buyer, especially after the company put in place a poison pill to make it more difficult for Musk to acquire the company without its approval. 
   
      But CFRA senior equity analyst Angelo Zino said Monday that Twitter’s board more seriously considering Musk’s offer may have come “from the Board’s realization that an alternative bid from a ‘white knight’ may be difficult to come by, especially following the decline in asset prices from social media companies in recent weeks/months.”
   
      It’s not clear whether Agrawal — who took over the CEO role from founder Jack Dorsey in November — will remain in the top job following the takeover. Musk previously tweeted a meme comparing Agrawal to former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Musk also said in his offer letter to buy Twitter that he does not “have confidence in management.”
   
      The deal could, however, put an end to nearly a decade of chaos at Twitter as a public company, during which it has cycled through CEOs, grappled with an activist investor and struggled to ignite growth and successfully monetize its influential user base.
   
      Agrawal said in Monday’s statement that “Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world,” He added: “Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.”

Elon Musk recently purchased 9.2% of Twitter stock, according to a filing Monday, making him the largest shareholder in the company.","Markets   
Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News          Elon Musk recently purchased 9.2% of Twitter stock, according to a filing Monday, making him the largest shareholder in the company.
   
      News of the purchase sent shares of Twitter
            
                (TWTR) soaring 22% in early trading. Musk did not disclose what he paid for the shares, but his stake was worth $2.9 billion as of the close of trading Friday, and $3.5 billion after the spike early Monday. 
   
      Musk’s filing did not disclose the purpose of the purchase or any plans for the company. But he has been a high-profile critic of Twitter policies in the past. Last month he said he was giving “serious thought” to creating a new social media platform.
   
      “Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy,” Musk tweeted last month. “What should be done?”
   
      Any time an investor buys 5% or more of a company’s shares, they must disclose the purchase in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although a stake of less than 10% in a company is considered “passive” in the eyes of Wall Street, it could signal an effort by Musk to take a more active role in how Twitter is run. That is one of the factors prompting other investors to buy shares and drive up the price early Monday.
   
      “I think he intends to go active and force change at Twitter,” said Dan Ives, tech analyst as Wedbush Securities. “This is a shot across the bow at Twitter’s board and management team to start discussions.”
   
      Even if Musk doesn’t try to change the way Twitter operates, his large purchase could prompt some other activist investors to take a stake in the company, Ives said.
   
      “One way or another, he’s going to change the course of Twitter,” Ives said.
   
      Ives said it’s probably not realistic for Musk or anyone else to try to start building a new, competing platform from scratch. Thus it makes more sense for him to try to change practices at Twitter itself. 
   
      Twitter did not have an immediate response to a request for comment on Musk’s investment.
   
      Musk has 80 million Twitter followers, far more than any other CEO. And he is a frequent tweeter, using it as the major form of disseminating news about both Tesla
            
                (TSLA) and SpaceX, the two companies he leads, neither of which has the traditional public relations department in place at other companies.
   
      His tweets have gotten him in trouble at times, though. 
   
      In 2018 Musk tweeted that he would be taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share, and that he had “funding secured” to do just that. It later became clear that while he did have discussions about funding such a bid, the funding was by no means secured.
   
      Musk settled the case by giving up his role as Tesla’s chairman, although he remains its CEO. He and Tesla each paid a $20 million fine as well, with Musk compensating the company for its payment by purchasing an additional $20 million in Tesla stock. 
   
      He also agreed to have any of his future tweets that might contain material information about the company reviewed by other executives at Tesla before sending them. The SEC has questioned whether or not he is complying with that provision of the agreement, and Musk and the agency are fighting about that matter in court.
   
      Twitter founder Jack Dorsey stepped down as CEO last November in a sudden move without the kind of advance notice that typically is given with this type of leadership change. He was succeeded by Parag Agrawal, who had been chief technology officer. 
   
      Musk had expressed support for Dorsey in the past when he was facing criticism from some shareholders. And when Agrawal was first named Twitter CEO, Musk responded to a tweet in which someone noted that Google, Microsoft, Adobe, IBM, Palo Alto Networks and Twitter are all run by executives who grew up in India, Musk replied with his own tweet: “USA benefits greatly from Indian talent!” 
   
      But just days later, he tweeted a meme that equated Agrawal to former Soviet leader  Joseph Stalin and depicted Dorsey as a former Stalin confident the dictator later had assassinated.  
   
      “Musk has already indicated that he did not agree with the appointment of Agrawal and that he desires some changes,” Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said in a note to clients. “This creates a bit more uncertainty about how Agrawal and the firm may respond to the firm’s now largest shareholder.”
   
      Unlike Musk, who owns more than 20% of Tesla, Dorsey’s stake in Twitter is relatively modest, with only 2.3% of the company’s shares. 
   
      Musk doesn’t necessarily need to become CEO of Twitter to be able to persuade the company to change its practices, Ives said. And it’s not completely clear what changes he would like to see.
   
      He recently ran a Twitter poll asking his followers whether they believe Twitter rigorously adheres to the principle of free speech — 70% said no — and another poll asking whether its algorithms should be open source — 83% responded yes. Both polls attracted more than 1 million responses.
   
Elon Musk says he's seriously considering creating a new social media platform         But the kind of changes that Musk might be advocating for at Twitter could be far different from those a traditional activist investor might seek, which typically concern increasing a company’s stock price.
   
      Twitter has faced activist investors before. Hedge fund Elliott Management in 2020 pushed for changes at the platform, including possibly forcing out Dorsey or insisting he give up a separate CEO position he had at payments technology company Square
            
                (SQ). Dorsey survived that challenge but ultimately decided to leave Twitter more than a year later.
   
      Twitter has become a target for critics on both sides of the political divide. Some believe the platform did not do enough to combat misinformation about Covid-19 and alleged election fraud. Others believe it was wrong to censor some points of view, including banning former President Donald Trump.         Twitter’s $31.5 billion market value is a fraction of what companies such as Tesla or rival social media giant Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, are worth. And Twitter’s stock has lost more than half of its value since February 2021, when the company reported that its efforts to tackle misleading content around the US elections cost the platform some users.
   
      Still it would probably be too expensive for Musk to buy Twitter on his own, said Ives, especially since most of his wealth is tied up in his holdings of Tesla and SpaceX shares. Musk is the world’s richest person, with an estimated net worth of $288 billion, according to Forbes. 
   
      “He’d have to partner up with private equity,” Ives said. “It’s not like he could do it himself.”

I assume it's because he has some genuine set of political and social beliefs about how Twitter should be run, and he feels like it isn't being ...","To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories Find anything you save across the site in your account  By Isaac Chotiner On Monday, Elon Musk bought Twitter for forty-four billion dollars. Musk, the C.E.O. of Tesla and the richest man on earth, plans to take the social-media company private, and has said that he wants Twitter to adhere more closely to the principles of free speech, which, in a statement, Musk called “the bedrock of a functioning democracy.” (In the same statement, he described Twitter as the “digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.”) Musk himself is a frequent tweeter, and it is assumed that he will continue to use the platform, and potentially reinstate the account of former President Donald Trump. He is also thought to be less likely to ban people for violations of the platform’s policies, which themselves may change. To talk about Musk and what the future holds for his newest acquisition, I spoke by phone with Matt Levine, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist who has been comprehensively reporting on and analyzing this story over the past month in his newsletter. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed how Musk has used Twitter to further his business interests, how he views freedom of speech, and why Twitter’s influence has long surpassed its financial value. Why do you think Elon Musk is buying Twitter? I assume it’s because he has some genuine set of political and social beliefs about how Twitter should be run, and he feels like it isn’t being run that way. I also think that he gets a lot of pleasure and utility out of tweeting and wants it to be optimized for his use. The value of his company is enhanced by his being a very strange public figure on Twitter, and so he clearly sees a lot of value in tweeting, and probably wants to own that for himself. It’s not immediately obvious why Tesla is valued as highly as it is. So how much do you connect Tesla’s worth to Elon Musk as a person and the way he orients himself toward the world, especially on Twitter? Tesla is a company, a relatively small car company, that makes good high-end electric cars, right? And the stock-market value of Tesla, which makes Elon Musk the richest person in the world, comes from a lot of extreme optimism about Tesla’s future ability to make more cars and become the dominant player in car-making as cars become more electric. Also, he’s just, like, a sort of futurist visionary—he’s building tunnels that he seems to think will be the future of transportation. He’s sending rockets into space. And so the value of these companies in the market is largely derived from expectations around how much money they’ll make in the future, as opposed to how much money they’ve made in the past. And those expectations are probably helped by having a charismatic, noisy founder who makes a lot of jokes online and is sort of a science-fiction character himself, and portrays himself as a science-fiction character, and who appeals to people who like that by making jokes. Tesla’s an expensive company to run. It’s not like a social-media company, where you rent some space from some servers and type some code. You have to build big factories to build cars. And, historically, Tesla has needed a lot of money to run itself, and Tesla has been able to sell millions of dollars of stock to new shareholders, to some extent bypassing the way Wall Street usually works, and not finding big institutions to sell stock through banks but, rather, going out to the market and selling stock to individual shareholders who are big fans of Elon Musk. So his public persona has helped him raise money to build a big company that does real things, and has also kept the valuation of that company really high because people like it and like him, and trust in his vision for the future because he is an accessible character to them in a way that a lot of other C.E.O.s are not. None of that translates in any direct way to the idea that owning Twitter will make that more valuable. At least it doesn’t to me. It’s not obvious to me how, if he bought Twitter, he would then be better able to get his message out, or better able to tell a story in a way that is good for Tesla and good for his economic interests. But it’s not obvious that it wouldn’t be. And he’s a really smart guy. One possible way to tell this story is that Twitter doesn’t make that much money compared to Facebook and other social-media companies. It’s not that big a company in terms of market cap. He might say, “Look, I get so much value out of this direct access to the public.” Owning that direct access to the public—owning that thing that creates so much value for Elon Musk and Tesla—it has to be valuable somehow, whether it’s by increasing the value that it creates for Tesla, or whether it’s by finding a way to monetize the value that it creates for sports stars and celebrities and Donald Trump and lots of other people. You know, Donald Trump’s tweets back when he was on Twitter could create billions or trillions of dollars’ worth of market moves, right? And Twitter never made a lot of money off of that. It’s not obvious how the company would, but if you’re sitting on top of a thing that can create that much value, surely, if you’re really smart then you can extract some value out of it. In terms of the way that you described him using Twitter for his business image and business interests, is he sui generis, or do you see this more widely now? I think it’s hard to imitate him, but I think people are, and I think that the classic example in the last five years or so has been the rise of meme stocks: companies like AMC and GameStop got very high market valuations and raised a lot of money through social media, popularity, and game memes. Adam Aron is the C.E.O. of AMC, and he’s this Harvard Business School graduate, a guy who’s worked at traditional corporate jobs. And he’s really embraced the meme-stock stuff, and does a lot of weird stuff on social media because his fans on Reddit and Twitter really like that and it seems to be good for the stock. And he’s pretty self-conscious about saying he works for retail meme investors now, and he’s going to do things that appeal to them. I think there was this longtime perception that, if you were a high-powered corporate person, you could only get in trouble on Twitter and you should write bland things that are vetted by lawyers. And I think people are recognizing that Elon Musk has created a lot of value for his companies by being unhinged on Twitter. And I think there are imitators, and I think we’re kind of early in the game. There will be more imitators. And that applies to politics. It’s the obvious counterpart, where people have realized that you can make a lot of hay politically by being a poster. In a column earlier this month, you wrote, “Look, this all makes complete sense, obvious, intuitive, simple sense. If you are the richest person in the world, and annoying, and you constantly play a computer game, and you get a lot of enjoyment and sense of identity from that game, maybe a little addicted, then at some point you might have some suggestions for improvements in the game.” At one level, this is a more personal account of his desire to buy Twitter. And then there is the more financial, or business, account, which you have just explained. But, at the same time, it almost seems like it’s impossible to disaggregate those two things, unless you think that all of his behavior is some elaborate performance or something, which I don’t think anyone really believes. I think that’s right. I mean, it’s possible that in his mind they are disaggregated, right, and I’m wrong about one of them. But what’s Tesla? At some level, I think he genuinely believes that he is doing something good for the world by electrifying cars and by getting rid of the internal-combustion engine. And I also think that he does enjoy making a lot of money and being rich from his Tesla stake. Deep analysis: He likes money. You could say I’m wrong. I mean, he doesn’t spend money on the type of luxuries that a lot of others do. I don’t know what motivates him. I don’t think it’s obvious that Tesla is either a pure moneymaking enterprise or a pure humanitarian enterprise. And I think that’s probably true of most of his enterprises, where he enjoys the personal challenges, like solving puzzles, and he enjoys being a rich, successful businessman, and he enjoys thinking that he’s doing something good for humanity. And I think that Twitter fits all of those things, too. Is there anything we can tell from his S.E.C. filings or other statements about what his plans are for Twitter? I can tell nothing. He talked at the TED conference about it. He said things like he wants more free speech, he wants to not permanently ban people, he wants less dependence on advertising because he thinks that is bad for free speech—which it is, by the way. I think that, if you unmoderate Twitter, you’re going to turn off advertisers. If you don’t care about advertisers, then you can have a more unmoderated Twitter. Things like that. Musk just tweeted that he wants his worst critics to remain on Twitter, because that’s what free speech means. I think a lot of people are worried that he’s going to ban his critics. From a corporate-finance perspective, the idea is that you buy Twitter and then it’ll be a private company and he’ll just control it. So he doesn’t need to present a business plan to, for instance, the board of directors of Twitter or the shareholders of Twitter. He can just say the business line: you take the cash and go away, and then it’s my company to control. So he said some things. They’re not binding on him. If he owns the company, he owns the company, and he can kind of do what he wants. On the other hand, he is getting money from outsiders: he’s getting money from banks, and potentially from equity partners. And so, presumably, he has some business plan for that, where he’s saying, “This is how I’m going to make money with Twitter.” He’s made noises about subscriptions. His conception of free speech seems broadly in line with what’s become a more right-wing or conservative approach to speech issues, which essentially argues that social-media companies should not be banning people for things that are considered inappropriate or hate speech or whatever else. Is that your reading of his take on free speech, or is he saying something more interesting? I haven’t heard anything interesting. I think that he has some history of being a troll on Twitter and of being kind of abusive. I think that his view of what is acceptable behavior on Twitter is that he would turn the dial a little lower, or higher, or whatever. He would turn the dial a little differently from how Twitter’s current management has turned it. He might have some interesting plan, but I haven’t heard it yet. He wants a little bit less moderation and a little bit more of a free-for-all. This seems like an issue for tech companies generally, but how does that manifest itself with a company that is international? Obviously, Twitter exists in lots of countries that have fewer free-speech protections than we do, and often governments ask social-media companies to crack down on speech that they don’t like. Do you have a sense of how Twitter has dealt with those issues generally and how he might differ? I think everyone’s had a hard time dealing with those issues. My impression is that, although Elon must operate internationally, his context for the buzzword “free speech” is largely American. But, if he then owns Twitter and the government in China wants to get the direct messages of dissidents in exchange for approving a factory for Tesla, he’s going to be facing pressures on him that are different from the pressures on a car company—pressures that are about speech and politics and user data. And I don’t know that he has better answers for those pressures than the not particularly glorious history of existing public social-media companies. Musk has had some run-ins with the S.E.C. already. What can you tell us generally about his approach to the S.E.C.? And do you think the government will weigh in in any way on this attempt to buy Twitter? His approach to the S.E.C. is, as he said publicly, that he does not respect the S.E.C. He’s called them bastards. He’s had a real bizarre set of confrontations with them, where he recklessly tweets stuff and the S.E.C. reviews it with a fine-tooth comb and tries to catch him saying things that aren’t true. And this all grew out of when he, in 2018, said that he was considering taking Tesla private, and that he had funding secured. And he just didn’t. He’s saying now that he did, but he just didn’t. And the S.E.C. thought that was misleading, which it was. So they sued him. They eventually settled for a relatively small amount of money. It was like twenty million dollars, which is nothing for him. [Musk also had to step down as chairman of the company.] Since then, there’s been a lot of bickering about that settlement. He’s a smart guy who doesn’t seem to talk to lawyers before he does stuff. Can the S.E.C. stop this takeover? I don’t think so. I think that, from a securities-law perspective, the S.E.C. is in the business of protecting investors and letting them take this deal if the deal is agreed upon, and that is the right thing for the S.E.C. to do. I don’t know if anyone else in the government could stop this. If you’re thinking from first principles, and if you believe that Twitter is, in some sense, the town square, as Elon Musk has called it, then you might be nervous about a whimsical billionaire taking it private, right? You might say, “Oh, we should have some restrictions on not letting you ban your enemies or whatever.” You could imagine a government, somewhere in the world, saying, “You know, we should regulate it the way we used to with television stations, where you have some sort of duty of balance or whatever.” But the actual regulatory apparatus around social media in the U.S. doesn’t really do that. So I think that if he buys it and does whatever he wants with it, that’s no concern to U.S. regulators. I’m less clear what the European situation is. They do like to meddle a little more. They just passed these new restrictions in Europe around social media. And it did seem as if, over the past year or two, there’s been this broad, at least rhetorical, consensus from both parties in the U.S. that social media is problematic and needs to be regulated more. However, in terms of this actually happening, it just seems quite far away. I think that, in the U.S., no one wants to give up an advantage on social media. So you don’t want a regulation that would hinder your side from doing something. And I think there’s just a general inability to do ambitious regulation in modern American gridlock politics. To take a step back, what have you made of Twitter as a company over the last fifteen years? I know it’s not the size of some other social-media companies, but I think everyone feels that it’s had an enormous impact on the world in some way. My impression is that the stereotype is basically correct. The impact does not translate into the kind of dollar value that other social-media companies get. Selling ads on Instagram is pretty easy, because you’re looking at pretty pictures of stuff that you think is nice, and then they show you a picture of something else that they think you might think is nice. And then you go buy it, right? The Instagram advertising model is very straightforward. The Facebook advertising model is: We know everything about you, so we know you’re looking to buy a car. So here’s a car ad or whatever. For Twitter’s advertising model, they don’t know much about you. The stereotype is you’re there to fight and make weird jokes and troll people. The use case of Twitter is just not as advertising-friendly as the other big social-media companies. And so, on the one hand, it plausibly has a bigger impact on the world because you are there to have political debates. And, on the other hand, it’s harder to monetize. So here’s this thing that’s had a huge impact on the world, and it’s had a huge impact on the guy who wants to buy it, turning him into the richest person in the world, and yet it’s never lived up to that as a business. If I were the richest person in the world, that would seem like an appealing business opportunity. I think that’s right. It’s not obvious that every product that is influential for the world should be able to capture all that value for its shareholders. But, you know, maybe Elon Musk can find better ways to capture that value. I mean, he’s talking about subscriptions, right? Yeah. What do you think about that? It doesn’t strike me as a wildly brilliant way to capture that value. Maybe. It seems like, if it worked monetarily, it would have some downsides in terms of this influence that we’re talking about. Oh, yeah. I would agree. I don’t know how serious he is. I don’t think his plan for Twitter is to turn it into a subscription-only service, but what do I know? He’s not the first person to notice that this is a hugely influential product with a somewhat lacklustre business. I think it’s a genuinely hard problem—but, you know, he built rockets and stuff. He might be looking for another hard problem to tackle. Naomi Klein sees uncanny doubles in our politics. Olivia Rodrigo considers the meanings of “Guts.” Isabel Allende’s vision of history. Julia Fox didn’t want to be famous, but she knew she would be. John Waters is ready for his Hollywood closeup. Patrick Stewart boldly goes there.

It is a seminal moment for the 16-year-old company, which emerged as one of the world's most influential public squares and now faces a string of challenges. Musk, who calls himself a free speech absolutist, has criticized Twitter's moderation. He wants Twitter's algorithm for prioritizing tweets to be public and objects to giving too much power on the service to corporations that advertise. Political activists expect that a Musk regime will mean less moderation and reinstatement of banned individuals including former President Donald Trump.  read more  Conservatives cheered the prospect of fewer controls while some human rights activists voiced fears of a rise in hate speech.  read more  Musk has also advocated user-friendly tweaks to the service, such as an edit button and defeating ""spam bots"" that send overwhelming amounts of unwanted tweets. Discussions over the deal, which last week appeared uncertain, accelerated over the weekend after Musk wooed Twitter shareholders with financing details of his offer. Under pressure, Twitter started negotiating with Musk to buy the company at his proposed $54.20 per share price.  read more  ""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" Musk said in a statement.

""Twitter as a company has always been my sole issue and my biggest regret. It has been owned by Wall Street and the ad model. Taking it back from Wall Street is the correct first step,"" he said. Twitter shares rose 5.7% on Monday to finish at $51.70. The deal represents a near 40% premium to the closing price the day before Musk disclosed he had bought a more than 9% stake. Even so, the offer is well below the $70 range where Twitter was trading last year. ""I think if the company were given enough time to transform, we would have made substantially more than what Musk is currently offering,"" said Jonathan Boyar, managing director at Boyar Value Group, which holds a stake in Twitter. However, he added, ""If the public markets do not properly value a company, an acquirer eventually will."" Musk’s move continues a tradition of billionaires' buying control of influential media platforms, including Jeff Bezos’ 2013 acquisition of the Washington Post. [1/2]Elon Musk twitter account is seen through Twitter logo in this illustration taken, April 25, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights Twitter said Musk secured $25.5 billion of debt and margin loan financing and is providing a $21 billion equity commitment. Musk, who is worth $268 billion according to Forbes, has said he is not primarily concerned with the economics of Twitter. ""Having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization. I don't care about the economics at all,"" he said in a recent public talk. Musk is chief executive of both electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and aerospace company SpaceX, and it is not clear how much time he will devote to Twitter or what he will do. ""Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go,"" Agrawal told employees on Monday.  read more  Edward Moya, an analyst at currency broker OANDA, said in an email to clients the deal was ""great news for Twitter shareholders as it doesn’t seem like the company was going to get things right anytime soon."" But he also said: ""Tesla shareholders can’t be happy that Musk will have to divert even more attention away from winning the EV (electric vehicle) race."" Still, Musk's 84 million-strong Twitter account is seen as an important, free public relations and marketing tool for Tesla. The Twitter transaction was approved by the company's board and is now subject to a shareholder vote. No regulatory hurdles are expected, analysts said. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, said the company's board of directors had its back ""against the wall"" once Musk detailed his financing package and no other bidders emerged. Although it is only about a 10th of the size of far larger social media platforms like Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) Facebook, Twitter has been credited with helping spawn the Arab Spring uprising and accused of playing a role in the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol. After Twitter banned Trump over concerns around incitement of violence following the U.S. Capitol attack by his supporters, Musk tweeted: ""A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech."" Trump, whose company is building a rival to Twitter called Truth Social, said in a Fox News interview on Monday that he will not return to Twitter. The White House declined on Monday to comment on Musk's deal, but said President Joe Biden has long been concerned about the power of social media platforms. ""Our concerns are not new,"" said White House spokesperson Jen Psaki, adding that the platforms need to be held accountable. ""The president has long talked about his concerns about the power of social media platforms, including Twitter and others, to spread misinformation.""

This $100M competition, funded by Elon Musk and the Musk Foundation, is the largest incentive prize in history and the XPRIZE Carbon Removal ...","Apr 22 2022  15 teams from nine countries take home $1M Milestone awards in next stage of $100M XPRIZE Carbon Removal competition to innovate and scale solutions to fight climate change LOS ANGELES (April 22, 2022) – XPRIZE, the leader in prize competitions to accelerate breakthroughs that benefit humanity, and the Musk Foundation announced today in celebration of Earth Day, that 15 teams have been designated as milestone winners in the $100M XPRIZE Carbon Removal competition. Each of the 15 milestone winning teams has been awarded $1M to recognize their efforts to date and support their continued work to scale solutions. The overall winners will be awarded $80M in 2025. The XPRIZE Carbon Removal competition was launched to encourage carbon removal innovators to work on tackling the biggest threat facing humanity: fighting climate change and rebalancing Earth’s carbon cycle. This $100M competition, funded by Elon Musk and the Musk Foundation, is the largest incentive prize in history and the XPRIZE Carbon Removal teams represent the largest collection of innovators working on carbon removal. The milestone winners are representing Australia, Canada, France, Iceland, Kenya, the Netherlands, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and the United States. Unlike previous prizes, every team is still eligible to compete and win the grand prize.  The teams are pursuing a mix of known solutions and new approaches to carbon removal:  ecosystem restoration, biochar, agricultural solutions, organic and inorganic ocean solutions, mineralization of mine tailings and naturally occurring minerals, direct air capture with geologic sequestration, agroforestry, soil carbon and more. Any solution is eligible to compete so long as it actually works, achieves net negative emissions, sequesters carbon dioxide durably over at least 100 years, and shows a sustainable path to ultimately achieving gigatonne scale. Crucially, the XPRIZE is not an ideas competition; it is an execution and demonstration competition. The submission process was extremely demanding by design, with a field of 1,133 teams narrowed to 287 teams meeting the eligibility criteria for the milestone awards. 70 expert reviewers screened and ranked the inbound proposals for scientific validity, and selected the top 60 teams. Judges went deeper on operations plans, performance data, life cycle analysis and cost estimates in order to ultimately select the top 15 teams taking home the interim $1M Milestone Awards.  “One year in, we already see the positive impact of the prize: hundreds of groups working on a wide range of promising carbon removal solutions. Not just ideas, but development and deployment plans, which is exactly what we need. The pace and depth of initiatives in carbon removal and other crucial climate solutions has never been greater, but we still need more—more and deeper emissions cuts, and more reliable, validated carbon removal solutions. That’s why we launched this prize in the first place,”  stated Dr. Marcius Extavour, chief scientist and vice president of climate and environment at XPRIZE. The 15 milestone winners, listed by primary solution type, include:  Air Land Ocean Rocks The competition now completely resets before the remaining $80M prize purse is awarded in 2025. Any team is eligible to win, whether they participated in this Milestone Round or not. Registration is open for any team interested in joining the competition to compete for the Grand Prizes. Registration closes on December 1, 2023. To win the Grand Prize, teams must demonstrate a working solution at a scale of at least 1,000 tonnes removed per year, model their costs at a scale of 1 million tonnes per year, and show a pathway to achieving a scale of gigatonnes per year in future, as validated by a third party. The Grand Prize winner and runners up will be announced on Earth Day 2025. For more information on XPRIZE Carbon Removal, please visit xprize.org/carbonremoval.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk took aim at Twitter Inc with a $43 billion cash takeover offer on Thursday, with the Tesla CEO saying the ...","April 14 (Reuters) - Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk took aim at Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) with a $43 billion cash takeover offer on Thursday, with the Tesla CEO saying the social media company needs to be taken private to grow and become a platform for free speech. ""I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,"" Musk, already San Francisco-based Twitter's second-largest shareholder, said at a TED Talk in Vancouver when asked about his bid. Musk made the bid on Wednesday in a letter to the board of Twitter - the micro-blogging platform that has become a global means of communication for individuals and world leaders - and it was made public in a regulatory filing on Thursday. His offer price of $54.20 per share represents a 38% premium to Twitter's April 1 close, the last trading day before his 9.1% stake in the social media platform was made public. Musk, the world's richest person with a $273.6 billion fortune according to a Forbes tally, rejected an invitation to join Twitter's board on Saturday after disclosing his stake, a move analysts said signaled his takeover intentions as a board seat would have limited his shareholding to just under 15%.  read more  After his TED talk, Musk hinted at the possibility of a hostile bid in which he would bypass Twitter's board and put the offer directly to its shareholders, tweeting: ""It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote."" Twitter was evaluating the offer with guidance from Goldman Sachs and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, according to a source. The company was also preparing a poison pill as a protective measure against Musk raising his stake as early as Friday, the source said. Shares of Twitter closed down 1.7% on Thursday. Investors were not convinced. Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal tweeted from his verified account about the deal. Describing himself as one of the ""largest & long-term shareholders of Twitter,"" he said Musk's offer undervalued the company and he rejected it. Musk, for his part, told Twitter it was his ""best and final offer"" and said he would reconsider his investment if the board rejects it.  read more  ""This is not a way to sort of make money,"" Musk said during the TED Talk. ""My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive, is extremely important to the future of civilization,"" Musk added. Musk, a self-described ""free speech absolutist,"" has been critical of the social media platform and its policies, and recently ran a poll on Twitter asking users if they believed it adheres to the principle of free speech. More than 70% of the 2 million votes cast said ""No"". After Twitter banned former President Donald Trump over concerns around incitement of violence following last year's U.S. Capitol attack by his supporters, Musk tweeted: ""A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech."" In remarks on Wednesday - before Musk's announcement - Trump said he ""probably wouldn't have any interest"" in returning to Twitter, where he had more than 88 million followers.  read more  Elon Musk talks at the Automotive World News Congress at the Renaissance Center in Detroit, Michigan, January 13, 2015.   REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre declined to comment on Musk's offer for Twitter, saying that market regulators operate independently from political leadership. Twitter employees, some of whom were panicked over Musk's impact on its ability to moderate content, attended an all-hands meeting on Thursday. Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal reassured them that the company was not being ""held hostage"" by news of Musk's offer to buy the company, according to a source. read more  Musk said U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley was acting as financial adviser for his offer. He did not say how he would finance the transaction if it goes ahead, but told the TED talk audience he ""had sufficient assets,"" without saying more. CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said Musk could finance the deal with debt and selling Tesla shares. Musk sold more than $15 billion worth of his Tesla (TSLA.O) shares, about 10% of his stake in the electric vehicle maker, last year to settle a tax obligation. Twitter's lower-than-expected user additions in recent months have raised doubts about its growth prospects, even as it pursues big projects such as audio chat rooms and newsletters. Founded just two years after Facebook, Twitter is dwarfed by the social network. Meta, which owns Facebook, generated $118 billion in revenue in 2021 from 1.93 billion daily users. Twitter earned $5.08 billion in revenue last year from 217 million daily users. ""The big question for the Twitter board now is whether to accept a very generous offer for a business that has been a serial underperformer and tends to treat its users with indifference,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. Twitter will not decide on the fate of Musk's bid on Thursday, according to a source familiar with the situation. What the board is discussing is the parameters of the valuation process and it would then ask its advisers to review the bid and await for the results, the source said. Musk has amassed more than 80 million followers since joining Twitter in 2009 and has used it to make several announcements. Musk is bound by a 2018 settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision requiring him to obtain pre-approval on some of his Twitter posts after he tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. ""If he really wants to take Twitter private his past run-ins with regulators might not pose an obstacle – but it might make potential financing sources leery of providing the cash for the deal – unless he is willing to pledge a large portion of his Tesla holdings to collateralize the debt,"" said Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses & Singer and former senior trial counsel at the SEC. Musk's move also raises the question of whether other bidders might emerge for Twitter. ""It would be hard for any other bidders/consortium to emerge and the Twitter board will be forced likely to accept this bid and/or run an active process to sell Twitter,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a client note. Musk admitted at the conference that success was not assured but his intent was to retain as many shareholders as allowed by law in a private company. Asked if there was a ""Plan B"" if Twitter rejected the offer, Musk told the TED conference audience without elaborating: ""There is.""

To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. By Bess Levin Like the employees of Twitter, who reportedly reacted to yesterday’s news with “shock and dismay,” a lot of people are not enthused about the idea of Elon Musk buying the social media network. But now, he is, and if you’re not familiar with the guy, or just think of him as the dude who sells electric cars and is really into space, you might be wondering why so many people are up in arms. And the answer is: He’s a huge jerk! Who regularly uses his massive platform and other sources of power to do bad things! Online, those things have included: While off-line, and more consequentially: That’s a disturbing list for a random person not taking over a company that plays a role in millions of people’s lives, and exponentially more so for one who is. By Kase Wickman By Chris Murphy By James Robenalt Musk has said that Twitter should avoid getting involved in content regulation, and given his documented history of spreading misinformation, attacking his perceived enemies, and retaliating against individuals who he thinks have wronged him, it’s not hard to see why. Which is more than a little worrisome to people who already think Twitter has a problem with misinformation and abuse (particularly towards women). Musk claims he needs to rescue Twitter from its current owners, who he thinks do not respect the First Amendment. But, as many have pointed out, “no one has a legal right to tweet—that is, to post on Twitter, a platform owned by a private company,” and the First Amendment, for zillionaires who are unaware, is about protection from government entities restricting what people are allowed to say, not privately held social media networks. That’s how, for example, Musk can get away with allegedly firing Tesla employees who disagree with him. Whereas with Twitter, he apparently wants to manipulate the idea of what “free speech” means, and has suggested he’ll allow people to say whatever they want without consequence, even if what they want to say constitutes harassment or threats or the kind of misinformation that poses a genuine risk to people’s lives. Which, as the above list suggests, is very much his thing.

A Complete Timeline of Elon Musk's Business Endeavors · 1995: Zip2 · 1999: X.com · 2000: PayPal · 2002: SpaceX · 2002: The Musk Foundation.","With Elon Musk close to claiming a new role as owner of Twitter after a winning bid to purchase it for $44 billion this week, the billionaire entrepreneur can add the social media app to a long list of business ventures he has led, invested in, and supported over his lengthy career. Here’s a timeline of Musk’s most notable business endeavors—both successful and not—over the past three decades. Along with his brother, Musk founded Zip2, an online business directory, as an online alternative to the standard paper yellow pages. (Google would not launch until 1998.) He sold it for over $300 million in 1999 to Compaq Computer Corporation. Musk was ousted as CEO in 1996, however, when the board of directors decided to install a more experienced leader in his stead. Musk invested some of his windfall from the Zip2 sale into his next venture: X.com, an online bank, launched with three other co-founders. X.com’s business model was innovative for its time, in that it incentivized sign-ups and eased the process of transferring funds digitally, with no need for mail or traditional banking infrastructure. In an interview with CBS MarketWatch at the time of the launch, Musk explained his business: “There are no minimum balances. You can open an account and receive a $20 promotional offer in your checking account. You can move $8 to your S&P fund, $3 each to your money market and bond fund, and be left with $6 in your checking.” He went on to expand more philosophically on the new company: “In my view, the Internet had gone through a couple of stages and was ready for another stage,” he said. “The first stage was where people could trust the Internet for information. This was perhaps ’95 or ’96. The second was to trust the Internet for purchases and begin to use credit cards online to buy books, toys, pet food and that kind of thing. I think we’re at the third stage now where people are ready to use the Internet as their main financial repository.” X.com merged with software company Confinity just one year later, forming PayPal, a secure online payments platform with a foundation in payments conducted for PalmPilots. PayPal would go on to be one of his most successful companies; Musk and his partners, including Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel, sold it to eBay in 2002 for a $1.5 billion stock deal. However, it was a rough start. PayPal was named at one point as one of the “worst business ideas” of 1999, and Musk himself was again removed from his role as CEO while on honeymoon in 2000, replaced by the board with Thiel. After going public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 2002, eBay snapped up PayPal. They would hold onto PayPal until 2015, spinning it off into a separate entity. Musk next set his sights on a lofty goal: space exploration, and the future colonization Mars. In the past 20 years, SpaceX has dealt with a series of rocket launch failures and Starship explosions. But it has also become a heavy-hitter in the space industry with a number of records to its name, including being the first private company to send a craft to the International Space Station and send astronauts to orbit. It is known for its reusable rockets. SpaceX is also behind the development of Starlink, a constellation of satellites intended to offer commercial internet service around the globe. Founded as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, the Musk Foundation is one of Musk’s least-talked-about endeavors. Its stated goals including supporting renewable energy and pediatric research and education, and the developing of “safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity.” Between 2002 and 2018 it handed out around $25 million, about half of that to OpenAI, a company owned by Musk himself. (Since 2012, Musk has also been a signatory of The Giving Pledge, in which many of the world’s richest people have committed to giving away the majority of their wealth at some point.) These days, Musk is perhaps best known for his leadership at Tesla, the electric car company named after famed inventor Nikola Tesla. Valued at over $1 trillion at one point in 2021, Tesla was founded in 2003 by two other men; Musk entered a Series A funding round with an investment of $6.5 million, and eventually took an increasingly active role in the company. He has been CEO since 2008. The Model 3 is the most popular electric car in production today, with over one million units sold globally. Tesla has come in for its fair share of controversy, however, from dealing with long production and fulfillment delays to safety issues with its vehicles and employee complaints about working conditions and management practices. Founded by his cousins in 2006, SolarCity received Musk’s patronage from the offset; he was their primary financial backer. A solar energy company that became the leading residential solar installer in the U.S. by the mid-2010s, SolarCity installed solar energy systems that were leased to residential users. Musk, via Tesla, acquired SolarCity in 2016 for $2.6 billion in stock and incorporated it into its operations as Tesla Energy. Musk co-founded OpenAI as a non-profit in 2015, with a for-profit artificial intelligence research lab component; it was started with a $1 billion collective pledge from its founders. Musk has been open about his interest in developing “friendly” AI that supports humanity, but he ended up resigning from the board in 2018 due to conflicts with Tesla’s AI projects. Another research endeavor, Musk co-founded Neuralink in 2016 with the goal of working on “brain-machine interfaces,” or BMIs, that can be implanted directly into the body. Neuroscientists have been skeptical of Neuralink’s research and claims. While they currently conduct experiments on animals, they moved plans to begin working on human subjects to 2022. Founded with the intention of helping dispel city traffic via underground tunnels as a subsidiary of SpaceX, the Boring Company is one of Musk’s side projects. Its aim: build tunnels. They first experimented by tunneling under the SpaceX factory in California. The Boring Company became an independent entity in 2018, and in 2021 completed a tunnel project in Las Vegas to shuttle visitors beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center. It is currently working on further tunnel projects in Las Vegas for underground transport. Other projects are primarily speculative. Musk once spoke boldly about an ambitious “Hyperloop” system, creating tunnels across the country to revolutionize and speed up underground mass transport between cities. However, Hyperloop mentions have been scrubbed from the Boring Company’s website. After buying up enough stock to make him a majority shareholder by April 1, Musk made the move to purchase Twitter for $44 billion at the end of April. His plans include making Twitter “better than ever” by “enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”"

Credit: PlantVillage. All Rights Reserved. April 22, 2022 By Cole Hons UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — An international team led by David Hughes, founder of Penn State’s PlantVillage project, has been named among 15 milestone winners of the latest round of the XPRIZE and Musk Foundation’s Carbon Removal Competition. The prize comes with a $1 million award funded by Elon Musk, which the PlantVillage team will use to demonstrate their capacity to draw down one billion tons of carbon per year in a sound and economically attractive way that benefits low-income farmers in Africa. For Hughes, who is also Huck Chair in Global Food Security, professor of entomology and biology, and director of the USAID Current and Emerging Threats to Crops Innovation Lab at Penn State, this latest development in the decade-long story of PlantVillage promises to further extend the viability of his vision for the program. ""This is an incredibly exciting validation of the approach that PlantVillage bets on, communities of African farmers and youth creating change,” said Hughes. “The goal of the carbon XPRIZE is massive carbon drawdown at an affordable price. We believe African farmers and African land offer the realistic potential of 1 ton of carbon, permanently sequestered at less than $25/ton. This prize money allows us to prove that case.""   The global market for carbon credits is enormous — $272 billion in 2020 — and growing. Many companies across the globe currently purchase industrial machine-enabled carbon offset credits at a price ranging from $600 to $2,000 per ton. Hughes believes his approach, centered on planting trees and permanently storing carbon as biochar in the soil, can do much better. An international team led by David Hughes, founder of Penn State’s PlantVillage project, has been named among 15 milestone winners of the latest round of the XPRIZE and Musk Foundation’s Carbon Removal Competition.  The PlantVillage team’s novel idea is to re-imagine smallholder African farms as “AI-powered carbon capture cubes,” said Hughes. This approach leverages a range of systematic tools and methods, which include: tagging trees with QR codes, mapping farmland with satellite imagery, deploying AI-enabled apps onto cellphones, and tracking carbon sequestration credits in a radically open and transparent way via the fast, inexpensive and scalable Solana blockchain platform, a digitally distributed public ledger of cryptocurrency transactions that exists across a network. One critical aim of this unique system is to make carbon credits publicly verifiable, with real-time monitoring. Another is to raise 200 million farmers out of poverty in Africa by developing a new income stream for them to be paid by customers seeking carbon credits on the global market. The overall vision for the project is to empower these farmers to collectively pull down a billion tons of carbon dioxide every year by planting and growing trackable trees on their land, helping not only themselves but the global community as well. ""Speaking on behalf of our entire agroforestry team and the broader PlantVillage Dream Team in Kenya, I can say we are all so honored to win this prize,"" said John Mayieka, Agroforestry Team lead for PlantVillage. “We are so excited to have won,” added PlantVillage country director John Chelal. “As Kenyans, we are proud to lead the way in helping the world fight climate change."" For Hughes, the carbon removal project is a further development in his long-term goal of taking Penn State's land grant mission into the 21st century. PlantVillage was conceived from the very start as a tool for bringing the latest and best Penn State research expertise into the hands of struggling farmers. Prior to planting and monitoring trees, the international PlantVillage team focused on addressing crop diseases in Africa with AI-enabled cellphones and mitigating crop destruction during the 2020 African locust crisis. In August of 2021, with the support of the Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, the team’s focus shifted to exploring how they could direct their energies toward carbon drawdown. By September, systemic planting and monitoring had begun in two Kenyan counties, Busia and Bungoma. To date, the team has planted and set up monitoring for more than 770,000 trees, and now expanded to Burkina Faso. “Speaking on behalf of our entire agroforestry team and the broader PlantVillage Dream Team in Kenya, I can say we are all so honored to win this prize.” John Mayieka, Agroforestry Team Lead for PlantVillage The XPRIZE is an intensely rigorous execution and demonstration competition. From a field of 1,133 teams, 287 teams met the eligibility criteria for the Milestone Awards. Seventy expert reviewers screened and ranked the inbound proposals for scientific validity, and selected the top 60 teams. Judges then went deeper on operations plans, performance data, life cycle analysis and cost estimates in order to ultimately select the top 15 teams taking home the interim $1 million Milestone Awards. The winning teams represent Australia, Canada, France, Kenya, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. For PlantVillage, this Milestone Award is actually XPRIZE win number two. In November 2021, a subgroup of the team, led by Penn State Ecology graduate student Edward Amoah, was selected as one of 23 teams to receive a $100,000 XPRIZE Carbon Removal Student Award. The recognition hinged on the team’s demonstration of a viable method for tracking and monitoring carbon sequestration on African farms. The overall XPRIZE Carbon Removal Competition now completely resets with a new, open playing field before $80 million in grand prizes are awarded in 2025. To win the grand prize, teams must demonstrate a working solution at a scale of at least 1,000 tons removed per year; model their costs at a scale of 1 million tons per year; and show a pathway to achieving a scale of gigatons per year in future, as validated by a third party. The grand prize winner and runners up will be announced on Earth Day 2025. Visit the XPRIZE Carbon Removal website for more information. Cole Hons Get the news by email"

Having a billionaire bullshitter fills a strange sausage roll of feelings: awe, jealousy, inspiration, terror, irritation. Like it or not, Musk ...","The world’s richest man has invented a new way to disregard the truth. You can call Elon Musk a lot of things. Agent of chaos. Savvy investor. Obsessive workaholic. But the tech-industry analyst Benedict Evans has a different suggestion. He calls Musk a “bullshitter who delivers.” I’d go even further: Musk exemplifies a new kind of bullshitter, one we haven’t really seen before. Call it the “bullionaire,” maybe: an unusual purveyor of infantile jackassery, whose unfathomable wealth makes it possible, and even likely, that he’ll carry out even the most ridiculous plan. Musk didn’t start an electric-vehicle business, but the one he muscled his way into, Tesla, became one of the most valuable companies on Earth last July. Once in charge, he decided that “CEO” was a stupid title and made himself the “Technoking” instead. From that throne, Musk oversaw the manufacture of far fewer vehicles than Ford, a company worth one-16th as much (and which Musk once compared to a morgue). Musk also is the CEO of SpaceX, a private company with an impressive fleet of reusable rockets that land upright just like they take off, as in an episode of Jonny Quest. His capacity to rule such an organization might be explained partly by the technoking’s claim to have previously been an alien. Musk became so concerned that superintelligent machines—another kind of alien, really—might overtake humanity, he committed millions to defend against their rise. One day in 2016, Musk got irritated at traffic. “Traffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging,” he tweeted. “It shall be called The Boring Company.” That would have been a funny joke if he hadn’t actually started a company by that name and secured contracts to bore tunnels under actual U.S. cities, such as Las Vegas and Miami. The tunnels carry—get this—Tesla vehicles, which create traffic jams when enough of them fill the tunnel (which is really just an expensive road). The Boring Company also made a flamethrower. Which isn’t boring, I guess. Looking to pay for his subterranean-car-tunnel enterprise, Musk remembered that the 1987 Mel Brooks film Spaceballs made a joke about funding its production via sales of swag, such as lunch boxes and flamethrowers. So he made flamethrowers—barely legal, because they “only” ignited a wall of fire up to 10 feet. Soon after, on Twitter, Musk denied a “rumor” that he planned to manufacture, Uruk-hai-style, a zombie apocalypse to spur demand for said flamethrowers. All 20,000 units sold out. When Musk does things, they tend to start with tweets. In 2018, the same year he made flamethrowers, Musk tweeted that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share (it’s a pot reference, if you didn’t know). The stock was trading at around $360 at the time, making the doobie-smokin’ price a substantial premium. The plan tanked, the stock dropped 100 points, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigated Musk for securities fraud. Eventually, he agreed to pay $20 million, and Tesla itself had to pay the same. Today, correcting for a five-for-one split, TSLA trades at the equivalent of more than $5,000 a share. The company is worth $1 trillion. Read: Of course Elon Musk wanted Twitter All that wealth inspired more deeds, and more tweets. This year, Musk decided that he liked tweeting so much, he wanted to buy 9 percent of Twitter. So he did, because it cost only a couple billion dollars, and he has roughly 270 billion of them. The problem is, he was supposed to file a disclosure with the SEC once he passed 5 percent equity in the company, and he delayed doing so by a few days. The stock rose by almost 30 percent when the news got out—which also meant Musk had saved a bunch of money by filing late. Musk was going to join the board, then he wasn’t, then it came out this morning that he offered to buy the whole company for $43 billion in cash (again, he’s got a lot of money). Elon Musk says or does absurd and even stupid things, but then those absurd and stupid things end up paying off.  The philosopher Harry Frankfurt wrote a famous article about bullshit in the 1980s, which became a bestselling 2005 book called On Bullshit. Both bullshitters and liars are trying to get away with something. But unlike the liar, who demonstrates an awareness of and concern for the truth in order to evade it, Frankfurt argues that bullshitters just don’t care about truth at all. Instead, a bullshitter strives to achieve their goals, whatever those goals are. For some of them, that amounts to hearing themselves talk. For others, it involves deception or even fraud. At first blush, the Muskian variety looks very different. He doesn’t seem like a man who is indifferent to the truth so much as one who is passionately devoted to the act of blowing raspberries. He named the models of Tesla S, 3, X, and Y, a leetspeak rendition of sexy. He made a pot joke about taking the company private. He joked (maybe?) about renaming Twitter as “Titter”—you know, like boobs? But his raspberries serve another function: They fill up a flotilla of trial balloons that, bound together by his wealth, can lift a house into the sky. Money talks, and bullshit floats. That’s how Musk turned a dumb pot gag into a government investigation into a hundred-billion-dollar payday. It’s how he got all of Twitter’s power users to accept that he was their new overlord this morning. Musk is indifferent to the truth because he has dominion over it. Read: What Trump did in Osaka was worse than lying Having a billionaire bullshitter fills a strange sausage roll of feelings: awe, jealousy, inspiration, terror, irritation. Like it or not, Musk really did make electric cars viable and desirable. He really did help inaugurate a new age of private aerospace. He really did make somewhat badass flamethrowers that he really sold and shipped to people who watched too much G.I. Joe in the 1980s. Musk’s schtick works because he’s the unusual, unfathomably wealthy person who actually spends very large amounts of time and money on random things. Most billionaires are boring. They hoard wealth and then offload it into a family foundation for tax benefits and eternal glory, or they push it into hedge or venture funds. They avoid the spotlight. Some pursue flights of fancy, as the other billionaire-begun space start-ups show. Others pursue Carnegie-style philanthropy, dressing power in the vestments of generosity. But Musk appears to goof around. He does whatever the heck he wants, however stupid it might be. In a world where so much wealth is concentrated in the hands of so few, that stupidity can be a sort of comfort. What would you do if you were that wealthy? The numbers say: nothing interesting. You’d use the money to make more money. At least Musk is having a good time. But a bullionaire is also terrifying, because you just don’t know what he’s doing next. The anthropologist David Graeber, in his 2018 screed on bullshit jobs, argued that work loses meaning when there’s a gap between its pretense and its reality. For most people with such jobs, the gap arises in the worker’s own mind. Store greeters or telemarketers might know that their job is useless or even actively harmful, but they have to pretend that it’s not in order to get through the day, appease their boss, and make a living. Read: The paradox of caring about ‘bullshit’ jobs In Musk’s case, that anxiety is outsourced to all the rest of us. When Musk tweets a joke, it might also be an actual plan that he intends to carry out. He may not even know whether that’s the case, but his preposterous wealth and predilection for risk always leave the option open. A much-less-massively wealthy but very weird individual such as Peter Thiel makes threats and plans in secret. That feels worrisome—what’s he up to? The bullionaire hides right out in the open. That feels even worse. (Vladimir Putin, whose wealth is unknown but has been speculated to exceed $200 billion, is another, different kind of bullionaire—one with graver whimsies.) In this sense, Musk has introduced a new tenor to bullshittery, one that Harry Frankfurt did not anticipate. Most bullshitters can’t close the gap between pretense and reality even if they wanted to. Bullshit used to mean what’s neither true nor false. Now it describes a state where anything, no matter how absurd, has the potential to be true. Call your flamethrower guy. Buy a social network. It’s no big deal—unless it is."

SpaceX is a private spaceflight company that sends satellites and people to space, including NASA crews to the International Space Station (ISS) ...","When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. SpaceX is the maker of Starship and a private space company known for its International Space Station missions. SpaceX is a private spaceflight company that sends satellites and people to space, including NASA crews to the International Space Station (ISS). Founder Elon Musk is also creating and testing a Starship system for lunar landings and, he hopes, future crewed Mars missions. The company sent its first two astronauts to the ISS on May 30, 2020, aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon and has sent several more crews aloft on behalf of NASA and other entities.  As of mid-2022, it is the only commercial spaceflight company capable of sending astronauts to space, although it may soon face competition from Boeing's CST-100 Starliner. Related: 8 ways that SpaceX has transformed spaceflight SpaceX was founded by Musk, a South African-born businessman and entrepreneur. At age 30, Musk made his initial fortune by selling his two successful companies: Zip2, which he sold for $307 million in 1999, and PayPal, which eBay purchased for $1.5 billion in 2002, The New York Times reported. Musk decided his next major venture would be a privately funded space company.  Initially, Musk had the idea of sending a greenhouse, dubbed the Mars Oasis, to the Red Planet. His goal was to drum up public interest in exploration while also providing a science base on Mars. But the cost ended up being too high, and instead, Musk started a spaceflight company called Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, now based in the Los Angeles suburb of Hawthorne, California.  He spent a third of his reported fortune, $100 million, to get SpaceX going. There was skepticism that he would be successful, which persisted into SpaceX's first years. After spending 18 months toiling privately on a spacecraft, SpaceX unveiled the craft in 2006 under the name Dragon. Musk reportedly named the spacecraft after ""Puff, the Magic Dragon,"" a 1960s song from the folk group Peter, Paul and Mary. He said he chose the name because critics believed his spaceflight aims were impossible.  Musk was already an experienced businessman when he started SpaceX, and he strongly believed that more frequent and more reliable launches would bring down the cost of exploration. So, he sought out a stable customer that could fund the early development of a rocket: NASA. (Later, he wooed launch clients from various sectors to diversify his customer base.) As such, his goal for SpaceX was to develop the first privately built, liquid-fueled booster to make it into orbit, which he called the Falcon 1.  The company experienced a steep learning curve on the road to orbit. It took four tries to get Falcon 1 flying successfully, with previous attempts derailed by problems such as fuel leaks and a rocket-stage collision. But eventually, Falcon 1 made two successful flights: on Sept. 28, 2008, and July 14, 2009. The 2009 launch also placed the Malaysian RazakSat satellite into orbit. Related: See The Evolution of SpaceX's Rockets in Pictures In 2006, SpaceX received $278 million from NASA under the agency's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) demonstration program, which was created to spur the development of systems that could transport cargo commercially to the ISS. The addition of a few more milestones eventually boosted the total contract value to up to $396 million. SpaceX was selected for the program along with Rocketplane Kistler (RpK), but RpK's contract was terminated with only partial payment after the company failed to meet the required milestones. Multiple companies participated in the COTS program in its early stages, in funded or unfunded contracts. In 2008, NASA awarded two contracts for commercial-resupply services. SpaceX received a contract for 12 flights (worth $1.6 billion), and Orbital Sciences Corp. (now Orbital ATK) received a contract for eight flights (worth $1.9 billion).    The workhorse rocket of the SpaceX fleet is the Falcon 9, and one of its features is reusability. Falcon 9 hefts much more cargo than Falcon 1: 28,991 lbs. (13,150 kilograms) to low Earth orbit, compared to Falcon 1's capacity of 1,480 lbs. (670 kg).  The first Falcon 9 booster landing took place on Dec. 21, 2015, and SpaceX now strives to make its boosters retrievable as a matter of course. They generally land on a robotic drone ship nearby the launch pad. Many of the Falcon 9 boosters have been used multiple times, to reduce launching costs. A more powerful rocket, known as Falcon Heavy, made its debut on Feb. 6, 2018, meeting almost all of its major milestones. Falcon Heavy successfully flew to orbit, carrying a Tesla Roadster (an electric car made by Tesla, another company owned by Musk) and a spacesuited mannequin nicknamed Starman. SpaceX ran a live stream of the launch and the Roadster's first few hours in space, which attracted attention from all over the world. The two rocket boosters landed successfully near Kennedy Space Center, as expected, but the core stage hit the ocean at 300 mph (480 km/h), which was too fast, and it didn't survive the impact. Falcon Heavy then performed an engine burn in space that is expected to bring the Roadster at least as far as Mars' orbit.  April 2019 saw a setback for SpaceX when a test of the crewed Dragon spacecraft, intended to bring NASA astronauts to space, experienced a malfunction while on the ground. This created a smoke plume visible for miles around Cape Canaveral, Florida. The incident set back the company's timeline for bringing people to the International Space Station. That said, the company has recovered and has been bringing people to orbit with few issues since the debut crewed mission in 2020. The next and most crucial milestone for SpaceX was space station delivery. Dragon, riding a Falcon 9 rocket, delivered its first cargo to the space station in May 2012 under a test flight for the COTS program. The launch was delayed for a few days because of an engine problem, but the rocket lifted off safely on the next try.  Spaceflight observers commended SpaceX's ability to send a cargo spacecraft to the ISS. Private spaceflight hadn't even been considered when the space station was developed in the 1980s and 1990s. SpaceX fulfilled the first of its regular commercial flights to the space station in October 2012. That flight achieved most of its objectives, but it experienced a partial rocket failure during launch. The failure ended up stranding a satellite, Orbcomm-OG2, in an abnormally low orbit, which led to the mission's failure.  That said, the first version of the Dragon spacecraft ran 20 flights to the space station through 2020, with all but one of them (CRS-7, in June 2015) arriving successfully. CRS-7 was lost due to a rocket anomaly and SpaceX made redesigns before the next, successful launch on April 8, 2016, which brought the inflatable Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) to space.  A new version of Dragon's cargo variant began flying in December 2020 and has executed all five of its planned missions successfully to date, as of mid-2022.  SpaceX developed several prototypes ahead of flying the Crew Dragon to space. One set, called DragonFly, performed a pad abort test at Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Facility (now Cape Canaveral Space Force Facility), as well as tethered hover tests at the SpaceX Rocket Development and Test Facility in McGregor, Texas. The company also used a pressure vessel qualification module and an environmental control and life support system module to test out key systems ahead of spaceflight. The first Crew Dragon to fly into space completed Crew Demo-1, which flew to the ISS on an uncrewed test on March 2, 2019, and splashed down successfully after eight days in space. That flown Crew Dragon spacecraft was unexpectedly destroyed after the flight during a separate set of tests to evaluate the abort system. SpaceX launched its first crewed test flight, Demo-2, on May 30, 2020, safely delivering astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the ISS. On the company's newly built Endeavour SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft, the two men returned safely to Earth on Aug. 2, 2020. On Nov. 15, 2020, the first successful operational flight, Crew-2, used a Falcon 9 rocket to safely launch four astronauts to the ISS aboard a Crew Dragon craft that the astronauts had named ""Resilience,"" in honor of ongoing efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic.  As of this writing, SpaceX has sent four crews of astronauts (NASA and international astronauts) to the ISS aboard Demo-2, Crew-1, Crew-2, Crew-3, and Crew-4. One more mission, Crew-5, is planned for 2022 and there is room in the current contract to order more missions as required for space station needs. Helping SpaceX's case has been ongoing issues in developing the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, but Boeing plans to run a second, uncrewed test flight in 2022 with aims to launch astronauts in 2023 if the test goes to plan. In pictures: Amazing launch photos of SpaceX's Crew-4 mission  Starship is the centerpiece of Musk's eventual plans to head to Mars. While the spacecraft remains in early testing, it is NASA's choice of lander to send Artemis astronauts to the moon no earlier than 2025. (NASA's selection had to overcome legal protests by Blue Origin after the agency pivoted to a sole-source contract over multiple vendors, citing a lack of money, but another solicitation was pledged in 2022.) The testing program began with a smaller vehicle known as Starhopper, which performed a series of tethered and untethered flight tests in 2019 and 2020. Then SpaceX began testing a series of Starship vehicles in high-altitude flights, starting with a cautious hop test of SN5 in August 2020. One of the program's greatest challenges was executing flip maneuvers in mid-air, which led to the demise of several Starships before SN15 achieved a soft landing on May 5, 2021. Starship is designed to launch to orbit and deep space aboard Super Heavy, the 230-foot (70-meter) tall booster that holds roughly 3.6 tons of liquid oxygen and methane in its propellant tanks. Like all of SpaceX's boosters, Super Heavy is planned to be reusable. It will feature four grid fins to assist in controlling the booster's descent.  The fully stacked Super Heavy and Starship were put together on a launchpad for the first time in August 2021, standing 395 feet (120 meters) tall. That's more than 30 feet (9 m) taller than NASA's massive Saturn V moon rocket.  This Starship-Super Heavy version is set to perform an orbital test in 2022, pending a delayed environmental review of the Federal Aviation Administration of SpaceX's launch facilities in Boca Chica, Texas. The public response to the review added more data points than FAA was anticipating, lengthening the process.  SpaceX's success in running Crew Dragon missions to the space station attracted missions from other companies, which use similar spacecraft to run high-Earth orbit missions, ISS missions and in one case, a crewed moon mission. The first Crew Dragon spacecraft used by non-professionals was the one that flew Inspiration4 into space. Four people rode to orbit on a mission to raise money and awareness for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. The crew used a variant of Crew Dragon with a large cupola window, flown in place of a docking mechanism as they didn't need to reach the ISS. The success of Inspiration4 inspired Jared Isaacman, the billionaire who had paid for the four seats, to begin his own private space program. Called the Polaris Program, it will run a series of missions for charity and for research purposes in space. Isaacman is expected to participate in all three missions. The first mission, Polaris Dawn, is scheduled to fly in late 2022. Another company, Axiom Space, plans to run a long series of research-oriented missions to the ISS using SpaceX Crew Dragons. The debut of the series was Ax-1, a 10-day mission in April 2022. Axiom's manifest calls for the company to launch a research module to ISS that will also allow for a film studio. Moon missions appear to be in play for further in the future. In 2018, Musk announced that Yusaku Maezawa, an artist and billionaire founder of the Japanese e-commerce giant Zozo, and a handful of artists will launch the trip around the moon in the 2020s. SpaceX did not disclose how much Maezawa paid for that trip. The mission is called dearMoon and Maezawa is seeking crewmates for the trip who have an artistic bent.  In 2019, Musk and SpaceX ignited controversy in the field of astronomy over the company's plans to place a constellation of 12,000 small satellites in orbit around the Earth in order to provide reliable internet access to remote places. So far, only 60 of these Starlink satellites have launched but they have already left unsightly trails in astronomers' telescope observations of the night sky. Many researchers fear that an increased number of satellites will cause problems for vital data-collecting enterprises. SpaceX has been testing out a special coating on the next round of Starlink satellites that could help make them less reflective and, therefore, less obtrusive in the night sky. That said, astronomers continue to sound alarms about the potential of intrusions in telescopic images. Wide-field imaging, and imaging at dawn and dusk, appear to be particularly affected by satellite streaks. While SpaceX has been in conversation with the astronomical community, studies continue to show the impact of Starlink on observations. For example, a 2022 research paper in the Astrophysical Journal showed the wide-field Zwicky Transient Facility's images are becoming more affected with time, as SpaceX deploys more satellites. NASA also raised concerns about Starlink in 2022, noting a proposal to place 30,000 more Starlink internet satellites into orbit will not only affect ground observations but may also interfere with launch windows due to the number of satellites passing overhead. Increasing space debris collision risk was also noted by the agency, although SpaceX says it has automation to reduce the risk as much as possible.  – SpaceX Starship: Key milestones for the world's most powerful rocket – Every SpaceX Starship explosion and what Elon Musk and team learned from them (video) – The history of rockets SpaceX has customers from the private sector, military and nongovernmental entities, which pay the company to launch cargo into space. Although SpaceX makes its money from launch services, the company is also focused on developing technology for future space exploration.  And Musk's dreams of flying to Mars are undimmed. In 2011, he told delegates at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) in San Diego that he planned to take people to Mars in 10 to 15 years. Three years later, at the International Space Development Conference, he said the reusable rocket stage would be a step in getting to the Red Planet. ""The reason SpaceX was created was to accelerate the development of rocket technology, all for the goal of establishing a self-sustaining, permanent base on Mars,"" Musk said at the time. ""And I think we're making some progress in that direction — not as fast as I'd like."" In 2016, Musk unveiled his technological plan for Martian transport, which is a part of his plan to create a self-sustaining Red Planet colony in the next 50 to 100 years. The Interplanetary Transport System, as the rocket is called, is essentially a larger version of the Falcon 9. The spaceship, however, will be quite a bit larger than the Dragon, as it is slated to carry at least 100 people per flight. (The crewed version of the Dragon for the ISS is expected to carry four people, on average.)   Musk followed up his announcement in 2017 by publishing a paper describing a future Red Planet city of a million people and providing more details about how the ITS would transport cargo and people. Musk updated his Mars plans in September 2017 in an address in Australia. He didn't mention the ITS during the talk; instead, he talked about a system called the Big Falcon Rocket (BFR). The spaceship that BFR will carry will be 157.5 feet (48 meters) tall and have 40 cabins for passengers, likely with a capacity of 100 people. Musk once again unveiled an update to his Mars plans, in September 2019, renaming the first BFR to Starship Mk1 and switching its outer coating from expensive carbon fiber to stainless steel. Photos of the shiny, sci-fi-looking craft being assembled at SpaceX's South Texas facilities, near the village of Boca Chica, circulated on the internet. Related: No more BFR: SpaceX changing name of Mars-colonizing rocket, spaceship Starship continues to feature in Musk's Mars plans. In a February 2022 update, Musk said it may be possible to reach a launch rate of one Starship vehicle every six to eight hours, and one Super Heavy rocket every hour, on missions that would send up to 150 tons of payload to orbit. Such a high launch rate is expected to bring down costs, Musk said, making Mars settlements more financially feasible. You can follow SpaceX on Twitter .

The $44 billion deal is done: Elon Musk owns Twitter. After layoffs, unpaid bills, and rate limits, he's rebranding the company as X, ...","Filed under: By  Richard Lawler, a senior editor following news across tech, culture, policy, and entertainment. He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget.  Elon Musk bought Twitter, and now he’s rebranding it as X. Signs have gone up (and back down), icons are changing, and an old plan is new. How’d we get here?  On April 4th, 2022, we learned that Musk had purchased enough shares of Twitter to become its largest individual shareholder. Eventually, he followed up with an unsolicited offer to buy 100 percent of Twitter’s shares for $54.20 each, or about $44 billion.  Twitter accepted Musk’s offer, but then things got weird because he tried to cancel the deal. There was a lot of back-and-forth about bots and text messages, but in the end, Musk settled on buying the company rather than facing a deposition or Chancery Court trial and eventually strode into Twitter HQ carrying a sink.  Since then, there have been layoffs, more layoffs, and even more layoffs — plus drama over Substack, unpaid bills, and blue checkmarks. With ad revenue still down from previous years, Elon finally abdicated the role of CEO in May 2023, installing longtime NBCUniversal ad executive Linda Yaccarino. Nov 9 Jay Peters X (formerly Twitter) has been steadily improving its features for live streams and broadcasts. Based on this screenshot, chat looks a lot like it does on Twitch. X is also going to let you add timestamps to posts containing video. Nov 9 Thomas Ricker From Kara Swisher’s interview with Ben Mezrich, author of Breaking Twitter:  In the book, there’s a scene when Musk signs the papers to take over Twitter, the first thing he screams out is, “Fuck Zuck! Fuck Zuck!” — which I haven’t seen reported anywhere else. Not reported, but easily imagined. [Intelligencer] Nov 6 Jay Peters Sony is terminating its X (formerly Twitter) integrations for PS5 and PS4, meaning you soon won’t be able to post screenshots and clips to X from those consoles. “As of November 13, 2023, integration with X (formerly known as Twitter) will no longer function on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 consoles,” Sony said in a support message on its website. “This includes the ability to view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).” Wario64 posted a screenshot of a similar message on Threads that appears to have popped up on a PS5 console. Nov 4 Jay Peters Forbes obtained emails that indicate that X, formerly Twitter, has started to work on a marketplace to buy handles that are no longer in use. Also, “in at least some cases, X/Twitter has emailed solicitations to potential buyers requesting a flat fee of $50,000 to initiate a purchase,” Forbes reports. That’s one way to make more money, I guess. [Forbes] Nov 3 Alex Heath Yesterday, employees at X received a crash course in private equity from the folks at Morgan Stanley, whose Shareworks platform is being used to manage the restricted stock units that Elon Musk has finally begun doling out. The issuance of new equity, complete with an official stockholder agreement and disclosure statement, marks the beginning of a new chapter in the saga of Twitter’s haywire transformation into X. The old Twitter, a publicly traded company incorporated in Delaware with an independent board of directors, has been dead for a year. In its place now is X Holdings, a private, Nevada-based corporation with one controlling shareholder and a PO box in Austin, Texas. Oct 31 Alex Heath Since Elon Musk bought Twitter a year ago, he has blown it up to create something else entirely.  What is now called X is in the process of becoming “a single application that encompasses everything,” he recently told employees. Being the “digital town square,” as he has described Twitter in the past, isn’t enough. For X to succeed in Musk’s eyes, the platform needs to compete with YouTube, LinkedIn, FaceTime, dating apps, and the entire banking industry.  Oct 30 Alex Heath Everyone knew that Twitter wasn’t worth $44 billion when Elon Musk bought it a year ago. Now, we know what Musk himself thinks it’s worth today: $19 billion. On Monday, employees at X were awarded equity in the company at a valuation of $19 billion, or $45 per share, according to internal documents seen by The Verge. That price is a 55 percent discount to Musk’s original purchase price, per the documents, which note that “the fair market value per share is determined by the Board of Directors based on a number of factors in a manner that complies with applicable tax rules.” (Musk is X’s chair and has yet to create a formal board.) Oct 30 Alex Heath Fidelity, which put $300 million into Musk’s $44 billion takeover of Twitter a year ago, thinks the company is about 65 percent less valuable now, according to Axios. That implies a valuation of between $15 and $16 billion, or the incineration of over $28 billion in enterprise value.  Musk didn’t acknowledge X’s financial state during a rare all-hands meeting with employees last week, though he did brag about some other numbers: he said that X is seeing roughly half a billion posts and over 100 billion impressions per day.   Oct 29 Wes Davis Elon Musk says the change is meant to “maximize the incentive for accuracy over sensationalism.”  A study earlier this month found X Premium verified users were getting heavy engagement as “superspreaders of misinformation” about the Israel-Hamas war. Oct 27 Emma Roth X, the platform previously known as Twitter, has introduced a new $16 per month Premium Plus plan that lets subscribers pay more to get the biggest boost for their replies. Not only does the plan offer the “largest reply boost,” but it also removes ads from your For You and Following feeds, according to a page detailing the features of the subscription. Premium Plus builds on the perks that come with X’s standard Premium plan (formerly Twitter Blue), which includes a blue checkmark, the ability to edit tweets, longer posts, longer video uploads, encrypted direct messages, and more.  Oct 27 Alex Heath This was his advice to employees during his first companywide meeting since renaming Twitter to X: “In any given meeting, make sure there is at least one piece of bad news. You can have more than one piece of bad news. If you’re in a meeting with me, always bring up at least one bit of bad news or more than that.” I have more from inside X’s first big all hands with Musk and Linda Yaccarino in this week’s Command Line: Oct 27 Jay Peters Elon Musk has now owned the company formerly known as Twitter for an entire year. It’s been a disaster. Before Musk, Twitter had its problems. It took forever to launch new features and had to try really hard to stop people from tweeting bad things. But for most of 2022, it was generally functional. Even as the company dealt with the chaos of Musk’s will-he-won’t-he approach to the acquisition, Twitter soldiered on with long-awaited updates like the edit button for Twitter Blue subscribers, new features for its Spaces audio rooms, and smaller improvements like new designs for icons. The company was working, even if it was moving slowly. Oct 27 Jacob Kastrenakes and Alex Heath Elon Musk wants X to be the center of your financial world, handling anything in your life that deals with money. He expects those features to launch by the end of 2024, he told X employees during an all-hands call on Thursday, saying that people will be surprised with “just how powerful it is.” “When I say payments, I actually mean someone’s entire financial life,” Musk said, according to audio of the meeting obtained by The Verge. “If it involves money. It’ll be on our platform. Money or securities or whatever. So, it’s not just like send $20 to my friend. I’m talking about, like, you won’t need a bank account.” Oct 27 Alex Heath Heading into the first joint all-hands meeting with Elon Musk and Linda Yaccarino at X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday, employees were asked to submit questions ahead of time.  Since Musk walked into the building literally carrying a kitchen sink exactly one year ago, companywide communication from him has been nearly nonexistent at X, save for his random, terse emails asking for things to be fixed in the middle of the night. The all-hands Thursday was the first time that both Musk and Yaccarino had addressed employees together. They didn’t answer any of their questions. Oct 26 Thomas Ricker X marks the spot, now located far below where it was last year ever since Elon Musk started meddling. The WSJ maps the decline in terms of active users, app downloads, ad money spent, and perceived value using lots of easy to understand charts. Oct 25 Emma Roth X, the platform previously known as Twitter, is rolling out audio and video calls. Several users on the platform, including some of us here at The Verge, have received a notification when opening the app, stating: “Audio and video calls are here!” There’s also a new “Enable audio and video calling” toggle within the app’s settings, which says you can “turn the feature on and then select who you’re comfortable using it with.” It includes options to allow audio and video calls from only people in your address book, people you follow, verified users, or all three. You can then make a call by opening a DM with another user, selecting the phone icon in the top right corner of the screen, and choosing audio or video call. Oct 24 Jay Peters Slack has retired its integration with X (formerly Twitter) because of X’s API changes introduced earlier this year. According to Slack, X’s API changes affected the functionality of the integration, which led to the decision to retire it. “Slack’s integration with X relies on access to its API, and changes to that API this spring impacted the integration’s functionality and the services it supports,” Rod Garcia, Slack’s VP of software engineering, said in a statement to The Verge. “The Twitter app for Slack has not been functional since X implemented these changes, so we have removed the app from the small set of customer workspaces that still have it installed. For more information, please see our update on Slack’s feature retirements page.” Oct 20 Jess Weatherbed The vast majority of viral misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war being posted on X (formerly Twitter) is being pushed by verified users, according to a recent study by NewsGuard — a for-profit organization that rates the trustworthiness of news sites. After analyzing the 250 most-engaged X posts between October 7th and October 14th that promoted incorrect or unverified information relating to the war, researchers at NewsGuard found that verified X accounts were behind 74 percent of it. The 250 posts analyzed within the study promoted one of 10 false or unsubstantiated war narratives identified by NewsGuard, including claims that CNN had staged footage of its news crew under attack in Israel, and videos claiming to show Israeli or Palestinian children in cages. In one week, the 250 posts collectively received 1,349,979 engagements (including likes, reposts, replies, and bookmarks) and were viewed over 100 million times globally. 186 of these top 250 posts were posted by verified blue-checked X accounts. Oct 18 Richard Lawler It’s been almost a year since Elon Musk took over Twitter and, well, a lot of things have happened since then. Now, after previously diving into the backstories of dating apps, Meta, and Tesla, the Vox Media podcast Land of the Giants launches a new season about Twitter, its richest user, and “why Twitter’s cultural and political influence far exceeds its size,” hosted by Peter Kafka. New episodes will arrive weekly starting on October 25th, and you can subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or other podcast apps. Oct 18 Alex Heath If you want to join X, the service formerly known as Twitter, via its website in New Zealand and the Philippines, be prepared to fork over $1 a year for the privilege.  The subscription, part of a so-called “Not A Bot” program, is beginning in those two countries and is designed to “bolster our already significant efforts to reduce spam, manipulation of our platform and bot activity,” X said Tuesday in an unsigned post on its help center. In addition, new web users in New Zealand and the Philippines will have to verify their account with a phone number, the post says. Fortune first reported that Musk was going to charge new users $1 a year shortly before X’s announcement went live.  Oct 15 Wes Davis The New York Times reported today that Australia’s government is charging Elon Musk’s platform $610,500 AUD (about $384,000 USD) for not answering all of its questions about how it handles child abuse imagery. The regulator reportedly didn’t get enough detail from Google either, but while it only got a warning, “X’s lack of a response was more extensive.”  Oct 14 Wes Davis CNBC reports that the National Labor Relations Board alleged, in a complaint filed Friday, that X violated labor law when it fired an employee who criticized the company. Elon Musk bought the company, then known as Twitter, in October and threatened to fire workers who didn’t return to in-person office work. After Yao Yue encouraged others in the company’s Slack to let the company fire them instead of quitting, she was fired for breaking an unspecified company policy.  CNBC writes that in the complaint, the NLRB accuses X of keeping workers at the company from exercising their legal labor rights. Yue alleges the company laid her off “in retaliation for her attempt to organize her co-workers not to resign, so they would have better legal footing” on which to challenge the company later.  Oct 13 Richard Lawler Now that X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, has managed to repeatedly send out its ad revenue sharing payments on time without any last-minute delays, engineer Eric Farraro is answering questions from users who still aren’t getting the payments they expect. Reasons include: 1) X users only earn ad revenue from other paying X users, 2) advertisers aren’t paying much to reach the demographic that the creator attracts, 3) the posts didn’t get a lot of replies, or 4) their content is not suitable for ads. That first reason is one that X hasn’t exactly hidden. Here’s how Farraro puts it in his new explanation: Oct 10 Richard Lawler The latest turn in the Elon Musk-directed platform X, previously known as Twitter, is that users can now block unverified accounts from replying to their posts.  This change arrives about 11 months after Musk launched paid verification for Twitter Blue, apportioning blue checkmark labels to people willing to part with $7.99 per month. It also means it could be harder for those who don’t pay for the service (with the exception of accounts forced into verified status) to refute misinformation, which researchers report has continued to increase.  Oct 7 Wes Davis Mashable reports that users on X, formerly known as Twitter, have seen unlabeled ads in their feeds while scrolling through the company’s mobile apps. When users tap them, they’re taken to other websites, with no way to block or report them.  Unlike normal ads that are just posts from company X accounts and have an “Ad” label, these new ones have no account associated with them.

DETROIT -- 
	A federal judge in California has rejected a request from shareholders in a lawsuit to force Elon Musk stop talking about his 2018 tweets in which he said he had the funding to make Tesla a private company. 
	The ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen Wednesday came just hours after the Tesla CEO's lawyer filed a document in the case saying that a gag order would trample on Musk's free speech rights. 
	Lawyers for the shareholders have argued that Musk is trying to influence potential jurors before the lawsuit comes to trial on Jan. 17. The lawsuit contends that the CEO's August 2018 tweets were written to manipulate Tesla's stock price, costing shareholders money. 
	Chen confirmed in an order Wednesday that he has ruled that Musk's 2018 tweets about having the money to take Tesla private at $420 per share were false. 
	But he wrote that one of the shareholders who pursued the gag order in the class-action lawsuit failed to prove his case. Chen wrote that the trial has been rescheduled for early next year, and that publicity during or just before a trial is a larger concern. He also wrote that the jury would be drawn from a large metro area, and that Musk's comments are consistent with public positions in another related court case. 
	Lawyers for the plaintiffs also argued that Musk violated an October 2018, court settlement with U.S. securities regulators. Musk signed the agreement to pay a $20 million fine and not make any statements denying the securities fraud allegations. Musk is challenging the agreement, saying it is unconstitutional. 
	The ruling comes about a week after Musk, the world's richest person, made a controversial offer to take over Twitter and turn it into a private company with a $43 billion offer that equals $54.20 per share. Twitter's board on Friday adopted a ""poison pill"" strategy that would make it prohibitively expensive for Musk to buy the shares. 
	At issue is Musk's April 14 interview at the TED 2022 conference, where he said that he did have funding secured to take Tesla private in 2018. He called the Securities and Exchange Commission a profane name and said he only settled the case because bankers told him they would stop providing capital if he didn't, and the Austin, Texas-based Tesla would have gone bankrupt. 
	Lawyers for the shareholders say Musk's comments in the interview were an ""unsubtle attempt to absolve himself in the court of public opinion"" over misrepresentations made with his Aug. 7, 2018 tweets. 
	But Musk attorney Alex Spiro wrote in his response that the shareholders didn't show that Musk's speech presented a ""clear and discernable danger"" that the whole community would be corrupted by pretrial publicity, or that finding 12 objective jurors would be impossible. 
	His motion says that Musk is in the middle of a public offer to take over Twitter, which has led to debate over censorship. Reporters, he wrote, have compared this to Musk's previous statements about taking Tesla private. 
	During the TED interview, Musk was asked if funding was secured for the Twitter deal, a reference to the 2018 Tesla tweets. ""Mr. Musk should be permitted to respond meaningfully and truthfully to inquiries such as this, and not be compelled to remain silent,"" Spiro wrote. 
	If Musk violated the SEC agreement, the agency can ask a judge to scrap it and restore the securities fraud complaint. The SEC wouldn't comment.

For all of Elon Musk’s town crying to Twitter shareholders and his jawboning of its board, it was Twitter’s financial performance that opened the door for the world’s richest man to pounce on what is arguably the most influential media company in the world. And it’s Twitter’s ability to monetise its user base that will be Musk’s biggest challenge. Until now Musk had been busy taking potshots at Twitter from the sidelines, offering uninvited criticism/advice to the social media platform. Elon Musk has succeeded. Now he has to make it payCredit: AP His crusade has centred on the need for Twitter to become a virtually unfettered vessel for free speech - or as Musk describes it - a digital town square for debate. The “tremendous potential” that Musk says Twitter possesses appears to focus on improving popularity through transparency - by unmasking the secret algorithms that determine the placement of posts and by defeating the bots disguised as individuals. (There is plenty of irony that democratisation and transparency of information is Musk’s platform for reform given he has a patchy history of selective disclosure. He was taken to court by the US securities regulator for misleading the market by tweeting that he had the finance to privatise Tesla. Only last week Twitter shareholders mounted a court action based on Musk’s late disclosure of his acquisition of an initial 9.2 per cent stake in the social media giant.) Indeed, in the various tweets Musk has posted on reforming Twitter’s prospects, the only one that addresses revenue was his plan to actually cut advertising from its premium service. (Musk later removed that post.) Musk’s version of keeping an informed market is leaving a trail of breadcrumbs punctuated with riddles via Twitter posts and one-off remarks. Spending $61 billion to promote his interpretation of free speech feels like a billionaire’s folly. A vanity purchase not dissimilar to the media moguls of old such as Rupert Murdoch who paid a premium price for influence. Twitter punches well above its financial weight in terms of influence. If Musk has a more comprehensive plan to make money from Twitter’s 217 million active daily users he hasn’t left a bread trail capable of being followed. Under the existing management, Twitter has already outlined a plan to reach 315 million active daily users by next year, but that is a goal not a guarantee. And Musk’s free-speech aspiration for Twitter risks alienating advertisers - many of whom have abandoned social media platforms like YouTube over concerns about content. Later this week Twitter will release its quarterly results which will shed some sunlight on how its plans are progressing. Based on analyst expectations the result will be disappointing and without Musk’s bid it is likely that Twitter’s share price would have come under renewed pressure. If this was to be a quarterly result that justified the Twitter board holding out for a higher offer, it may not have capitulated to Musk so indecently quickly. The $US54.20 per share offer price is almost 30 per cent below last year’s peak price, which doesn’t represent a vote of confidence in Twitter’s revival prospects under its current management. The current management will have already begun packing up their desk family photos and pot plants given Musk has at least been transparent about the fact that he doesn’t rate them. Musk’s success in lobbying Twitter’s shareholders that his offer fully values the company is further evidence that the path back to revenue growth and sustainable profits is a long one with questionable certainty. Elon Musk needs to work out how to make Twitter pay.Credit: AP There are two sets of shareholders with a horse in the Twitter race. Musk has secured a large part of his financing using Tesla shares as security. If Musk’s great free speech experiment doesn’t work and Twitter cannot generate the cash to finance Musk’s loans, he may have to sell some Tesla stock. This prospect will already have created a potential overhang in Tesla shares. Already it has been largely responsible for the 12.8 per cent fall in its shares since Musk took his initial holding in Twitter. The weakness in Tesla’s share price comes despite last week smashing Wall Street’s expectations to report a 81 per cent increase in revenue over the previous corresponding quarter. Managing Tesla through the unprecedented supply chain challenges will tax Musk’s expertise. Its shareholders will be understandably wary of Musk’s ability to divide his attention between executing on Tesla and re-engineering Twitter’s business. Even for the world’s richest man, buying Twitter is littered with risks. The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

(Miguel Roberts/The Brownsville Herald via AP, File)                       As the uproar over Elon Musk’s $44 billion buyout of Twitter reaches a crescendo, another Musk drama, still chaotic four years after it began, has been back in court. Ironically, that spectacle started with a Musk tweet about doing an audacious deal. Then, with Wall Street awaiting his next move, the Tesla CEO changed directions, admitting that his plan to buy all the electric car maker’s stock might be too much trouble. As regulators prepared to sue the billionaire for defrauding investors, he pondered his position in the corporate universe in a livestreamed interview while puffing on pot. The episode made for a confounding, but now familiar, study in both Musk’s manic ambition and his delight in contradiction. It’s no wonder then that, as the world’s richest man pursues a Twitter takeover described by one investment firm as veering “from comical to surreal,” even those who’ve watched him for years remain flummoxed about what he has up his sleeve. “This is a guy who’s more transparent than 99.99 percent of other CEOs and yet he’s harder to predict because he has the confidence to be able to publicly change his mind,” said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business and law professor.  
“Would Musk be more successful if he toned it down? I think the answer is no, because he wouldn’t be Musk.” This week Musk is again keeping people guessing. First he embraced a European measure to keep hate speech and misinformation off social media. Less than 24 hours later, he announced that he’d reverse Twitter’s ban of former President Donald Trump, who was kicked off the platform for inciting violence. Meanwhile, doubt remains about whether Musk will even go through with the deal. He could still walk away by paying Twitter a $1 billion termination fee, a huge figure yet a fraction of his total fortune. But if the 50-year-old Musk’s gambit has made anything clear it’s that he thrives on contradiction. Musk boasts that he’s acquiring Twitter to defend freedom of speech. But he has long used the platform to attack perceived foes who dare to disagree with him. He is supremely confident in his own judgment and abilities. But he has openly acknowledged vulnerabilities, disclosing his angst over a breakup in a 2017 interview with Rolling Stone and telling a Saturday Night Live audience last year that he was the show’s first host with Asperger’s syndrome. He’s a brilliant visionary, widely admired for reimagining what a car can be, not to mention his ventures in rocket travel, solar energy, computerized brain implants and constructing a network of underground tunnels. But his apparent joy in trashing the conventions of corporate behavior has alienated analysts, regulators, employees and others unsure what to make of him. Even Musk seems to get that many people don’t get him. “I don’t think you’d necessarily want to be me,” he told podcaster Joe Rogan in the 2018 interview during which the CEO, wearing an “Occupy Mars” T-shirt, took a drag on a blunt stuffed with tobacco and marijuana. “I think people wouldn’t like it that much. It’s very hard to turn it off.” That combination of intellect, will and the power of enormous wealth thrill some and scare others. Either way, Musk -- whose 92 million followers on Twitter rivals uber celebrities like Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga -- is impossible to ignore. “He’s the poster child for disruption,” said Benjamin Breier, the former CEO of Kindred Health Care and author of a book about unconventional corporate leadership. Born in South Africa, Musk has been something of an outlier since childhood, teaching himself computer programming at 10, according to a 2015 biography by journalist Ashlee Vance. Two years later he pocketed $500 from the sale of a video game he created that had users shoot down alien spacecraft. He left Pretoria at 16 for his mother’s native Canada before moving to the U.S. on a student visa. At 24 he dropped out of Stanford after two days in its Ph.D. physics program to try his luck in the 1990s dot-com boom. Together with brother Kimbal, he launched Zip2, an online business directory. Short on cash, Musk did all the coding, squatting in a small office whose landlord was out of the country. The brothers slept on a futon in turn, showering at a YMCA and living on food from a 24-hour Jack-in-the-Box, they told a group of admirers during a 2020 discussion  available on YouTube. A year later, a venture capital firm agreed to back the business and eventually Zip2 was sold to Compaq for $307 million. Musk used his share of the profits to found what would become the PayPal online payment business. That sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. “After that, he thought, well, should he do space research or solar energy or electric cars?” his mother, Maye Musk, recalled during a 2021 appearance on CBS This Morning. “I said just choose one, and of course he didn’t listen to me.” Musk, fascinated by rockets since childhood, founded Space Exploration Technologies, better known as SpaceX, to develop cost-effective reusable rockets. Two years later he was courted to invest in a startup called Tesla. But he soon clashed with co-founder Martin Eberhard, who recalls Musk as craving attention and anxious to claim credit as a visionary. “Every time there was an article that didn’t feature him, he blew a gasket,” Eberhard, who sued Musk and Tesla after he was ousted from the CEO’s post, said during a 2018 interview with the AP. “As you can see from his personality right now, he’s very interested in the limelight.” On Twitter, Musk recently called Eberhard a “liar.” As Tesla’s chairman, Musk could be incredibly demanding, pushing employees to meet goals many considered impossible, said Gene Berdichevsky, the battery engineer on the company’s first production vehicle. Some ideas failed despite exhaustive efforts. But those that proved correct ended up “changing the world,” he said. Musk is likely to be just as unrelenting at Twitter, said Berdichevsky, who now leads a company developing new types of battery chemistry. “There will be immense pressure on the management team,” he said. “They will be asked to do things that they don’t necessarily think are reasonable. Some of them will not be reasonable and others will completely transform things.” Keith Rabois, a venture capitalist who worked with Musk at PayPal, said such idiosyncrasies are not unusual among people whose ideas upend the status quo. “Elon on his worst day is probably 100 times more effective than anybody else in America,” Rabois said in a 2018 interview with AP. Musk’s creative energy, though, is intertwined with a penchant for erratic behavior.  That was spotlighted in 2018, as Tesla struggled to ramp up production of its Model 3 sedan. Inside its California factory, Musk berated engineers for delays and defects before acknowledging that his overreliance on automation was the source of many of the problems. Meanwhile, he scolded analysts for asking “boring, bonehead questions” about Tesla’s ability to deliver.  Then Musk tweeted out of the blue that he was considering taking Tesla private and had secured the financing.  Tesla’s stock soared before he backtracked and the Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for defrauding investors. Musk and Tesla ended up paying fines of $20 million each and agreeing that any tweets potentially affecting the stock price be reviewed by a Tesla lawyer. Musk dismisses the fine, but bridles at the restriction. Late last month a federal judge rejected his contention that the settlement violates his right to free speech. The prolonged battle with the SEC reflects Musk’s disdain for public officials who challenge him. In 2020 he tangled with health officials who limited staffing at the California factory to prevent the spread of COVID, calling stay-at-home orders “fascist.” This year he clashed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration over a recall of so-called “Full Self-Driving” vehicles programmed to roll through stop signs at low speed if there was no crossing traffic. Lawyers answering to Musk have lashed out at California officials, painting them as bullies for a lawsuit accusing Tesla of rampant racial discrimination at its plant. Musk seems to relish taunting regulators, calling the SEC the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission” -- and worse. “You have a guy who probably has an unmeasurable IQ and who also is a little bit of a fifth grader who says something in class that he knows will get him sent to the principal’s office,” and delights in doing so, said Gordon, the Michigan professor. But the pushback against the SEC is about more than ego. It also spotlights the way Musk has latched on to Twitter to express his personal and corporate identity. Musk, whose account has the sixth-highest number of followers, has posted more than 17,000 times, according to Socialtracker, often long after the workday is over. He’s suggested that some of those tweets are composed under the influence of red wine, vintage records and the sleeping pill Ambien. “Some people use their hair to express themselves,” he’s said. “I use Twitter.”  Musk and his fans, though, also use the platform to go after those seen as adversaries. Days before agreeing to buy Twitter, Musk tweeted a photo of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, using a crude sexual term to make fun of his belly. That was relatively mild. A San Francisco short seller who questioned Musk’s leadership of Tesla has alleged that the CEO and one of his acolytes, Omar Qazi, were responsible for a series of tweets insulting him and falsely asserting he had been arrested for child abduction. The diatribes were part of a campaign of 80,000 coordinated tweets “praising Tesla and attacking its critics,” according to the lawsuit filed by investor Aaron Greenspan, who runs a legal document website. Qazi called the allegations “absurd,” in an email. In court papers, Tesla lawyers have dismissed the charges of a Musk-led Twitter mob as conspiracy theories. But a recent Musk tweet critical of a top Twitter executive was followed by a flood of racist and misogynistic attacks by trolls backing the CEO. Musk did not respond to an interview request for this story. But speaking briefly with AP at New York’s Met Gala, he reiterated his pledge to rid Twitter of spam bots and trolls spreading junk messages online. “That’s obviously diminishing the user experience,” Musk said. “I’m on the warpath, so if somebody is operating a bot and troll army, then I’m definitely their enemy.” But a University of Maryland researcher recently concluded that such bots have been used to generate hundreds of thousands of positive tweets about Tesla, potentially buoying its stock in years when it was under pressure. Neither the company nor its supporters has taken responsibility for those bots. But Musk has said that for real people who use Twitter, most anything is fair game. “Twitter’s a war zone,” he said in a 2018 interview with 60 Minutes. “If somebody’s gonna jump in the warzone, it’s like, “Okay, you’re in the arena. Let’s go.” Statements like that raise numerous questions about how Twitter would change with him in charge. Musk, worth about $240 billion, appears to believe that pressure to produce profits is responsible for Twitter’s efforts to curb hateful speech and misinformation that alienate advertisers.  As a private company, Twitter would answer only to Musk and the targets he sets, focusing less on profit and instead on opening itself to more voices, said Eric Talley, a Columbia Law School professor specializing in corporate finance. That sounds to many like a worthy idea. But Twitter’s reliance on advertising was the impetus for its efforts to detect and cap extremism and misinformation, said Angelo Carusone of Media Matters, a watchdog group. Without that pressure, Musk seems set on reshaping a platform he says has shifted too far left after banishing Trump and others. But for all Musk’s confidence, he risks running afoul of Apple and Google, which power most of the world’s smartphones. Both have stringent policies against misinformation, hate speech and other misconduct, previously enforced to boot apps like the social media platform Parler from their devices. “This could turn into one of those moments where you have an unstoppable force coming up against two immovable objects,” said Carusone, who admitted concern about how the tech giants might apply their standards. Musk, who waxes about preserving Twitter as the public square of the internet, hasn’t addressed what he’d do if his efforts to open it to more voices wind up jeopardizing its accessibility. Then again, the billionaire has never been one to shy away from a contradiction. AP writer Barbara Ortutay contributed to this report from San Francisco.

Similar emails were sent to SpaceX, according to The New York Times. Musk said in two separate emails that people must show up for at least 40 hours per week in a main Tesla office. ""If you don't show up, we will assume you have resigned,"" he said in one of the emails, first reported by Electrek and also obtained by CNBC. ""Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla,"" Musk said in the first email, according to Electrek. ""This is less than we ask of factory workers."" ""If there are particularly exceptional contributors for whom this is impossible, I will review and approve those exceptions directly,"" the email continued. ""There are of course companies that don't require this, but when was the last time they shipped a great new product? It's been a while,"" Musk wrote in the second email sent. He added that it's important for senior employees to show their presence and said it's why he ""lived in the factory so much"" and that, had he not, ""Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt."" ""Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth. This will not happen by phoning it in,"" he added. Responding to an inquiry about the leaked emails from a Twitter account known for promoting the CEO and Tesla, Musk said: ""They should pretend to work somewhere else."" The outspoken CEO is known for his intense work expectations, especially of factory workers, pushing them to meet extremely ambitious production goals. For example, when Covid numbers were rising in California in April 2020, Musk called health restrictions ""fascist"" in a rant during a company earnings call. He also kept his company's Fremont, California, plant operating despite health orders but faced no repercussions from the state or Alameda County.

In an effort to retain talent during what's been dubbed the ""Great Resignation,"" employers such as Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Meta allow at least some remote work, depending on the employees' position and location. By contrast, some big tech employers including Atlassian and Airbnb now allow remote work year-round. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Here's one of Musk's emails, as transcribed by CNBC: From: Elon MuskTo: ""Everybody""Tue. 5/31/2022 [time stamp redacted]Subj: To be super clear Everyone at Tesla is required to spend a minimum of forty hours in the office per week. Moreover, the office must be where your actual colleagues are located, not some remote pseudo-office. If you don't show up, we will assume you have resigned.The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence. That is why I lived in the factory so much- so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt.There are of course companies that don't require this, but when was the last time they shipped a great new product? It's been a while.Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth. This will not happen by phoning it in.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk. CEO Elon Musk demanded that Tesla employees must return to the office for in-person work at least 40 hours per week or they'll be let go. News of the policy was disclosed in a series of leaked emails Musk sent on Tuesday, according to electric car news site, Electrek. ""Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla. This is less than we ask of factory workers,"" Musk wrote. The billionaire added that employees' offices must be a ""main Tesla office, not a remote branch office unrelated to the job duties"" Electrek reports. In an email, Musk said he would directly review and approve any requests for exemption from the company's return-to-work policy, but emphasized to his staff: ""If you don't show up, we will assume you have resigned."" ""Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth. This will not happen by phoning it in,"" Musk added. Tesla did not respond to NPR's immediate requests for comment. However, in a reply to one user on Twitter who asked Musk about the leaked emails, he responded back saying, ""They should pretend to work somewhere else.""  They should pretend to work somewhere else The billionaire has been vocal against his stance against remote work, criticizing Americans and their work ethic in the past.  During an interview with Financial Times, Musk said that Americans are trying to ""avoid going to work at all,"" making the comparison to Chinese factory workers who work hard and ""won't even leave the factory.""

https://time.com/6180638/tesla-esg-index-musk/,Why Tesla CEO Elon Musk Is Calling ESG a 'Scam' | Time,20220501,"May 25, 2022 ... Tesla's CEO took to Twitter to air his frustration over the news that the company had slipped off the S&P 500 ESG index. “ESG is a scam. It has ...","Elon Musk-led electric car manufacturer Tesla lost its place this month on the S&P 500 index dedicated to companies excelling at environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. Though there were 34 other companies also removed from the index following its annual reshuffle, the company stands out for its focus on environmentally conscious transportation. In a blog post published May 17, S&P Dow Jones Indices’ head of ESG indices for North America Margaret Dorn explained that, although Tesla’s ESG score has remained relatively “stable” year-on-year, it had been outflanked by global industry peers. The index provider cited several contributing factors to this change, including alleged incidents of racial discrimination at one of the company’s factories that resulted in the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing bringing a lawsuit against Tesla. The company said in a February 2022 statement that it strongly opposes all forms of discrimination and harassment and called the lawsuit “unfair and counterproductive, especially because the allegations focus on events from years ago.” Musk, who is the CEO of Tesla, tweeted his displeasure with the index reshuffle, claiming that “@SPGlobalRatings has lost their integrity [sic]”. The world’s richest man complained that oil giant Exxon Mobil—which has been mired in controversy over claims of climate denialism—was listed in the top 10 for ESG, while his electric car company was booted off the list entirely. Here, why Tesla lost its place on the S&P 500 ESG Index, and what it means for the company: Launched in 2019, the S&P 500 ESG Index measures the stock value of some of the largest companies by market capitalization listed in the U.S. which meet certain sustainability criteria. It is similar in scope to the original S&P 500 Index, but aims to help investors choose between companies based on their commitment to strong ESG goals. The constituents of the index are filtered for participating in certain industries deemed antithetical to ESG goals—such as tobacco and controversial weapons manufacturing—and for their scores under the United Nations Global Compact, a global framework of corporate social responsibility. Finally, companies with the lowest scores relative to their peers are excluded from the index. Read more: Thinking of Investing in a Green Fund? Many Don’t Live Up to Their Promises, a New Report Claims The ESG Index is intended to provide a more accurate representation of businesses’ corporate responsibility commitments than what a company claims on its website. “You can’t just take a company’s mission statement at face value, you have to look at their practices across all those key dimensions,” Dorn told Reuters. More than 300 of the companies included in the original S&P 500 Index feature on the ESG ranking, including Apple, Nvidia, JP Morgan Chase, and Exxon Mobil. During the annual rebalance on May 2, social media giant Meta, pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson, and car maker Chevron were all removed from the list, alongside Tesla. Meanwhile, Musk’s acquisition Twitter target, and oil refiner Phillips 66 were added. In her May 17 blog post, Dorn said that Tesla fell off the rankings after moving down the index relative to its global industry peers. The reasons she cited for this drop included the car maker’s lack of low-carbon strategy and codes of business conduct, allegations relating to racial discrimination and poor working conditions at one of its factories, and the company’s handling of deaths and injuries linked to its driver-assistance systems. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication of this story. A spokesperson for the company previously told the Guardian that Tesla aims to have “as close to zero injuries as possible and to become the safest factory in the auto industry worldwide.” Tesla and Musk have said that the vehicles’ autopilot system makes its cars safer, according to the New York Times.  “While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider ESG lens,” Dorn said. Tesla’s CEO took to Twitter to air his frustration over the news that the company had slipped off the S&P 500 ESG index. “ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors,” Musk wrote. In a series of further posts the tech titan shared memes mocking the inclusion of six oil companies on the index, and claiming that a good “ESG score” amounts to a business’s compliance with “the leftist agenda.” The concept of ESG has faced skepticism in certain sectors, largely for allowing companies and investors to avoid scrutiny for socially irresponsible activities or investments. According to Bloomberg, the world’s largest ESG-focused exchange-traded fund has almost invested 3.1% of its assets in the oil and gas sector—the very industry that is accelerating the climate crisis. In its 2021 Impact Report, Tesla said that “current ESG evaluation methodologies” are “fundamentally flawed” because it lacks focus on the company’s “real-world impact” on society and the environment. Tesla board member Hiro Mizuno tweeted that “current ratings often overweight reduction of negative impacts while neglecting positive impacts.” Although not all investors will agree on Tesla’s expulsion from the index, it could have an impact on the company’s stock value. Fen Munster, former technology analyst who’s now a managing partner at venture-capital firm Loup Ventures, told Bloomberg that it could force some investors to sell their holdings, because “funds benchmarked to the ESG index cannot hold the stock now.”  Adding to investor concerns, Musk has batted off claims in recent weeks that his proposed $44 billion acquisition of Twitter is distracting him from the electric vehicle maker. His financing plans for the deal have alarmed some Tesla investors, as Musk has taken out a $6.25 billion dollar loan backed by Tesla stock. He has already sold more than $8.5 billion of Tesla stock to contribute to the sale. Other investors remain committed to Tesla. John Streur, president of Morgan Stanley unit Calvert Research and Management, told Reuters that Tesla is still on his company’s ESG indexes, even after the S&P index decision, saying he believed that Tesla had embraced the necessary tenets of ESG.

Below is a reaction from Anthony D. Romero, ACLU executive director:  “You’d be hard-pressed to find a more steadfast opponent of Trump and his policies than the ACLU, but Elon Musk’s decision to re-platform President Trump is the right call. When a handful of individuals possess so much power over the most important forums for political speech, they should exercise that power with restraint. If Trump violates the platform rules again, Twitter should first employ lesser penalties like removing the offending post — rather than banning a political figure. “Like it or not, President Trump is one of the most important political figures in this country, and the public has a strong interest in hearing his speech. Indeed, some of Trump’s most offensive tweets ended up being critical evidence in lawsuits filed against him and his administration.

An S&P Dow Jones Indices executive said it had removed Tesla from the S&P 500 ESG Index because of issues including claims of racial ...","May 18 (Reuters) - An S&P Dow Jones Indices executive told Reuters on Wednesday it has removed electric carmaker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) from the widely followed S&P 500 ESG Index (.SPXESUP)because of issues including claims of racial discrimination and crashes linked to its autopilot vehicles, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded with harsh tweets including that ""ESG is a scam"". In it changes, effective May 2, the sustainability index also added soon-to-be-Musk-controlled Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N) while dropping Delta Air Lines and Chevron Corp, according to an announcement. The back-and-forth over the index changes reflects a wider debate about the metrics used to judge corporate performance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, a growing area of investing. Tesla has become the most valuable auto industry company by pioneering EVs and expanding into battery storage for electric grids and solar-power systems. Factors contributing to its departure from the index included Tesla's lack of published details related to its low carbon strategy or business conduct codes, said Margaret Dorn, S&P Dow Jones Indices' head of ESG indices for North America, in an interview. Even though Tesla's products help cut planet-warming emissions, Dorn said, its other issues and lack of disclosures relative to industry peers should raise concerns for investors looking to judge the company across environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. ""You can't just take a company's mission statement at face value, you have to look at their practices across all those key dimensions,"" she said. Tesla representatives did not immediately respond to questions. The company has previously called ESG methodologies ""fundamentally flawed."" Musk tweeted that ""Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn’t make the list! ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors."" Asked about the tweet, a representative for the index provider said Musk may have been referring to a list on a company blog post of the largest 10 constituents by market cap of the S&P 500 ESG Index after the removal of Tesla and others. The list is ""not a ranking of best companies by ESG score,"" the representative said. [1/4]The logo of car manufacturer Tesla is seen at a dealership in London, Britain, May 14, 2021. REUTERS/Matthew Childs Acquire Licensing Rights Exxon now accounts for 1.443% of the weight of the index. Apple Inc was the largest at 9.657%. Investors concerned about issues like diversity and climate change have poured billions of dollars into funds using ESG criteria to pick stocks, prompting debate about how effectively the funds promote change or whether they push companies too much on issues that should be settled by government policy. S&P Dow Jones Indices is majority-owned by S&P Global Inc. (SPGI.N) Musk and others have complained the firm and its rivals conflate too many issues by bundling ESG concerns into one total score. For instance a fund based on the S&P 500 ESG Index, the SPDR S&P 500 ESG ETF, received the low rating ""D"" by climate activist research group As You Sow, which noted despite its title and sustainability mandate, fossil fuel stocks make up 6.5% of fund assets. In the company blog post reviewing changes from April 22, S&P's Dorn said the index aims to keep industries weighted the same as they are in the regular S&P 500 index ""while enhancing the overall sustainability profile of the index."" In practice that means it can keep oil companies while leaving out big players like Facebook parent Meta Platforms (FB.O) and Wells Fargo & Co.(WFC.N) Dorn said Tesla's ESG score had declined slightly from the ""22"" it received last year. At the same time the average score among other automakers improved, pushing Tesla out of the ESG index because of a rule against including lowest-quartile performers. Dorn and others did not immediately describe other details such as the reasons Twitter or Phillips 66 were added or other companies dropped. Among other big ESG ratings agencies, MSCI Inc (MSCI.N) gives Tesla an ""average"" ESG rating, while the Sustainalytics unit of Morningstar Inc gives Tesla a ""medium risk"" rating, according to the firms' websites. On Wednesday a U.S. safety regulator opened a special crash investigation into a Tesla crash this month in California, among more than 30 crashes under investigation involving advanced driver assistance systems.

Elon Musk tells employees to return to office or 'pretend to work' elsewhere ... Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive, has asked employees to ...","Neither Musk nor Tesla confirmed he sent memo with remark but the CEO tweeted: ‘They should pretend to work somewhere else’ Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive, has asked employees to return to the office or “pretend to work somewhere else”, according to a memo sent to staff. About 30% of US office workers are still working from home, according to Nick Bloom, a Stanford economics professor and co-founder of Working from Home Research Project. Many companies are moving to a hybrid work model where staff will come in two or three days a week. But the world’s richest man has apparently soured on the idea of his executives working from home. In a memo headlined “Remote work is no longer acceptble” [sic], Musk wrote that “anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla. This is less than we ask of factory workers.” Neither Musk nor Tesla have confirmed that he sent the memo but in a reply to a Twitter follower asking for “​​additional comment to people who think coming into work is an antiquated concept”, Musk wrote: “They should pretend to work somewhere else.” They should pretend to work somewhere else In the memo Musk said he would “review and approve” any cases where staff could not meet the minimum. Tesla joins a wave of companies mandating a return to office for employees. While some big employers have embraced voluntary work-from-home policies permanently, others including Alphabet’s Google are betting that it is best to push in-person interactions among colleagues. The news comes as Musk continues to pursue a takeover of Twitter, whose San Francisco office, he has suggested, could be turned into a “homeless shelter since no one show up anyway”. The Twitter chief executive, Parag Agrawal, tweeted in March that Twitter offices would be reopening but employees could still work from home if they wanted to. “Wherever you feel most productive and creative is where you will work and that includes working from home full-time forever,” Agrawal said in a tweet. Here’s the announcement to the company about our approach and commitment to truly flexible work. pic.twitter.com/XPl86HuQqG Reuters contributed to this article"

Elon Musk. Elon Musk was accused of sexual misconduct by a SpaceX flight attendant. Andrew Kelly/Reuters. A flight attendant for SpaceX said ...","Jump to        SpaceX, the aerospace firm founded by Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest man, paid a flight attendant $250,000 to settle a sexual misconduct claim against Musk in 2018, Insider has learned. The attendant worked as a member of the cabin crew on a contract basis for SpaceX's corporate jet fleet. She accused Musk of exposing his erect penis to her, rubbing her leg without consent, and offering to buy her a horse in exchange for an erotic massage, according to interviews and documents obtained by Insider. The incident, which took place in 2016, is alleged in a declaration signed by a friend of the attendant and prepared in support of her claim. The details in this story are drawn from the declaration as well as other documents, including email correspondence and other records shared with Insider by the friend. According to the declaration, the attendant confided to the friend that after taking the flight attendant job, she was encouraged to get licensed as a masseuse so that she could give Musk massages. It was during one such massage in a private cabin on Musk's Gulfstream G650ER, she told the friend, that Musk propositioned her. After Insider contacted Musk for comment, he emailed to ask for more time to respond and said there is ""a lot more to this story."" ""If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light,"" he wrote, calling the story a ""politically motivated hit piece."" Insider extended the deadline and reiterated the offer to Musk to comment on the claims. He did not respond. Reached via cell phone, SpaceX vice president of legal Christopher Cardaci said, ""I'm not going to comment on any settlement agreements."" SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment to its general media contact email address. The flight attendant told her friend that the billionaire SpaceX and Tesla founder asked her to come to his room during a flight in late 2016 ""for a full body massage,"" the declaration says. When she arrived, the attendant found that Musk ""was completely naked except for a sheet covering the lower half of his body."" During the massage, the declaration says, Musk ""exposed his genitals"" and then ""touched her and offered to buy her a horse if she would 'do more,' referring to the performance of sex acts.""  The attendant, who rides horses, declined and continued with the massage without engaging in any sexual conduct. The attendant ""is not for sale,"" the friend's declaration said. ""She is not going to perform sexual favors for money or gifts."" The incident occurred during a flight to London. In an interview with Insider, the friend described the attendant's allegations in more detail. She spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing fears for her personal safety, but Insider is aware of her identity. Insider is also aware of the flight attendant's identity, but is not naming her because she has claimed to be a victim of sexual misconduct. She declined to comment for this story. ""He whipped out his penis, it was erect,"" the friend said, describing the allegations. ""And he started propositioning her, like he touched her thigh and told her he would buy her a horse. And he basically tried to bribe her to perform some sort of sexual favor."" The friend said that the attendant told her about the misconduct while they were on a hike together shortly after the London trip. The friend described the attendant as distraught and visibly shaken. ""She was really upset,"" the friend said. ""She didn't know what to do."" The flight attendant told her friend that work began to dry up after she refused Musk's advances. ""Before the incident, she regarded Mr. Musk as a person to look up to,"" the declaration says. ""But after he exposed himself, touched her without permission, and offered to pay her for sex, she was full of anxiety.""  ""She figured things could just go back to normal and she would pretend like nothing happened,"" the friend told Insider. ""However, she started to feel as if she was receiving some sort of retaliation where her shifts were cut back, and she was starting to feel really stressed."" Eventually, the declaration says, the attendant felt ""she was being pushed out and punished for refusing to prostitute herself."" SpaceX places a special emphasis on massages, going so far as to employ in-house massage therapists as a perk for executives. According to the friend, the flight attendant was encouraged by her superiors to purchase her own professional massage training for her sessions with Musk.  ""They encouraged her to get licensed as a masseuse, but on her own time, on her own dime,"" the friend said. ""They implied that she would get to fly more often if she were to do this because she'd be able to give Elon proper massages. I thought that was kind of strange because — you weren't hired to be a masseuse. You were hired to be a flight attendant. And if Elon likes massages, then he should be paying for you to go to masseuse school. But she was just so happy and eager to have the job and be able to travel."" In 2018, after becoming convinced that her refusal to accept Musk's proposal had diminished her opportunities at SpaceX, the attendant hired a California employment lawyer and sent a complaint to the company's human resources department detailing the episode. Around that time, the attorney's firm contacted the friend and asked her to prepare the declaration corroborating the claims. The attendant's complaint was resolved quickly after a session with a mediator that Musk personally attended. The matter never reached a court of law or an arbitration proceeding. In November 2018, Musk, SpaceX and the flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims. The agreement also included restrictive non-disclosure and non-disparagement clauses that bar the attendant from ever discussing the severance payment or disclosing any information of any kind about Musk and his businesses, including SpaceX and Tesla. Musk is currently engaged in a bid to purchase Twitter driven by his professed belief that ""free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy."" Earlier this month, he wrote on Twitter that ""sunlight is the best disinfectant."" Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. The friend told Insider that she decided to come forward without consulting the flight attendant because, as a survivor of sexual assault, she felt an obligation to share what she has been told about Musk. Unlike the flight attendant, her friend is not bound by any non-disclosure agreement. ""I absolutely felt a responsibility to come forward with it, especially now,"" she said. ""He is the richest man in the world. Someone with that level of power causing that kind of harm and then throwing some money at the situation, that's not accountability. There are predators all over the world. But when someone is particularly wealthy and powerful, they literally have systems that are like a machine working for them, to set them up to be able to do whatever they want."" Remaining silent, the friend said, would make her complicit. ""When you choose to remain silent, yeah, you do become a part of that system,"" she said. ""You do become a part of that machine that allows someone like Elon Musk to continue to do the horrible things that he's done."" Non-disclosure agreements are crucial components of that machine. The friend said that before she reached out to Insider, she called the attorney who represented the victim. The attorney told her that, although she was free to speak to the press, sharing any documents from the case — including her own declaration — could put the flight attendant at risk. ""Her primary concern was clearly her client,"" the friend said. She recalled the attorney saying that confidentiality provisions are ""bullshit"" and that if any other women have been victimized by Musk, they ought to come forward. But when it came to her client, the attorney urged the friend not to share the declaration. ""That would be a massive problem,"" she told the friend. California, where SpaceX is headquartered, no longer permits companies to require non-disclosure clauses in agreements like the one the attendant signed. Just months after her settlement in 2018, then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law the ""Stand Against Non-Disclosure Act,"" which bars the use of NDAs going forward in settlements involving sexual harassment, discrimination, or assault unless they are requested by the plaintiff. The attorney did not respond to requests for comment. ""If there were a way for [her] to come forward without putting herself at risk, without jeopardizing her life in any way, I believe she would,"" the friend of the attendant told Insider. ""I hope she feels like I did the right thing. I hope she feels I said the things that she didn't feel safe enough to say."" This is the only known allegation and settlement for sexual misconduct tied personally to Musk.  Two of his companies, however, have faced allegations of sexual harassment in the past. In December 2021, the same week he was named Time's Person of the Year, four women who worked at SpaceX spoke out about sexual harassment they said they faced at the company, where Musk is the CEO. One, Ashley Kosak, published an essay recounting being groped and touched inappropriately by male employees while she was an intern. Three others — one of whom said she was bound by a non-disclosure agreement — recounted similar treatment to the New York Times. In response to the reports, SpaceX president and chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell sent a company-wide email saying that ""timely reporting of harassment is key to our maintaining SpaceX as a great place to work; we can't fix what we don't know,"" the Times reported. She added that SpaceX will ""rigorously investigate all harassment or discrimination claims and take rapid and appropriate action when we find our policy is violated."" And at least six women have sued Tesla, where Musk is the CEO, alleging sexual harassment at a Tesla factory. Men at the factory ogled women and remarked on their clothes, the complaints said, leading some women to wear baggy outfits and use stacks of boxes to obstruct the views of leering co-workers. Some of the women claimed they were retaliated against when they came forward. The friend told Insider that if anyone else was mistreated by Musk, she hopes they will publicly tell their story. If there are other victims, she said, ""I would like for them to come forward. I would like for the truth to be revealed.""

""He whipped out his penis, it was erect,"" the friend said, describing the allegations. ""And he started propositioning her, like he touched her thigh and told her he would buy her a horse. And he basically tried to bribe her to perform some sort of sexual favor."" The friend said that the attendant told her about the misconduct while they were on a hike together shortly after the London trip. The friend described the attendant as distraught and visibly shaken. ""She was really upset,"" the friend said. ""She didn't know what to do."" The flight attendant told her friend that work began to dry up after she refused Musk's advances. ""Before the incident, she regarded Mr. Musk as a person to look up to,"" the declaration says. ""But after he exposed himself, touched her without permission, and offered to pay her for sex, she was full of anxiety.""  ""She figured things could just go back to normal and she would pretend like nothing happened,"" the friend told Insider. ""However, she started to feel as if she was receiving some sort of retaliation where her shifts were cut back, and she was starting to feel really stressed."" Eventually, the declaration says, the attendant felt ""she was being pushed out and punished for refusing to prostitute herself."" SpaceX places a special emphasis on massages, going so far as to employ in-house massage therapists as a perk for executives. According to the friend, the flight attendant was encouraged by her superiors to purchase her own professional massage training for her sessions with Musk.  ""They encouraged her to get licensed as a masseuse, but on her own time, on her own dime,"" the friend said. ""They implied that she would get to fly more often if she were to do this because she'd be able to give Elon proper massages. I thought that was kind of strange because — you weren't hired to be a masseuse. You were hired to be a flight attendant. And if Elon likes massages, then he should be paying for you to go to masseuse school. But she was just so happy and eager to have the job and be able to travel."" In 2018, after becoming convinced that her refusal to accept Musk's proposal had diminished her opportunities at SpaceX, the attendant hired a California employment lawyer and sent a complaint to the company's human resources department detailing the episode. Around that time, the attorney's firm contacted the friend and asked her to prepare the declaration corroborating the claims. The attendant's complaint was resolved quickly after a session with a mediator that Musk personally attended. The matter never reached a court of law or an arbitration proceeding. In November 2018, Musk, SpaceX and the flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims. The agreement also included restrictive non-disclosure and non-disparagement clauses that bar the attendant from ever discussing the severance payment or disclosing any information of any kind about Musk and his businesses, including SpaceX and Tesla. Musk is currently engaged in a bid to purchase Twitter driven by his professed belief that ""free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy."" Earlier this month, he wrote on Twitter that ""sunlight is the best disinfectant."" Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. The friend told Insider that she decided to come forward without consulting the flight attendant because, as a survivor of sexual assault, she felt an obligation to share what she has been told about Musk. Unlike the flight attendant, her friend is not bound by any non-disclosure agreement. ""I absolutely felt a responsibility to come forward with it, especially now,"" she said. ""He is the richest man in the world. Someone with that level of power causing that kind of harm and then throwing some money at the situation, that's not accountability. There are predators all over the world. But when someone is particularly wealthy and powerful, they literally have systems that are like a machine working for them, to set them up to be able to do whatever they want."" Remaining silent, the friend said, would make her complicit. ""When you choose to remain silent, yeah, you do become a part of that system,"" she said. ""You do become a part of that machine that allows someone like Elon Musk to continue to do the horrible things that he's done."" Non-disclosure agreements are crucial components of that machine. The friend said that before she reached out to Insider, she called the attorney who represented the victim. The attorney told her that, although she was free to speak to the press, sharing any documents from the case — including her own declaration — could put the flight attendant at risk. ""Her primary concern was clearly her client,"" the friend said. She recalled the attorney saying that confidentiality provisions are ""bullshit"" and that if any other women have been victimized by Musk, they ought to come forward. But when it came to her client, the attorney urged the friend not to share the declaration. ""That would be a massive problem,"" she told the friend. California, where SpaceX is headquartered, no longer permits companies to require non-disclosure clauses in agreements like the one the attendant signed. Just months after her settlement in 2018, then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law the ""Stand Against Non-Disclosure Act,"" which bars the use of NDAs going forward in settlements involving sexual harassment, discrimination, or assault unless they are requested by the plaintiff. The attorney did not respond to requests for comment. ""If there were a way for [her] to come forward without putting herself at risk, without jeopardizing her life in any way, I believe she would,"" the friend of the attendant told Insider. ""I hope she feels like I did the right thing. I hope she feels I said the things that she didn't feel safe enough to say."" This is the only known allegation and settlement for sexual misconduct tied personally to Musk.  Two of his companies, however, have faced allegations of sexual harassment in the past. In December 2021, the same week he was named Time's Person of the Year, four women who worked at SpaceX spoke out about sexual harassment they said they faced at the company, where Musk is the CEO. One, Ashley Kosak, published an essay recounting being groped and touched inappropriately by male employees while she was an intern. Three others — one of whom said she was bound by a non-disclosure agreement — recounted similar treatment to the New York Times. In response to the reports, SpaceX president and chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell sent a company-wide email saying that ""timely reporting of harassment is key to our maintaining SpaceX as a great place to work; we can't fix what we don't know,"" the Times reported. She added that SpaceX will ""rigorously investigate all harassment or discrimination claims and take rapid and appropriate action when we find our policy is violated."" And at least six women have sued Tesla, where Musk is the CEO, alleging sexual harassment at a Tesla factory. Men at the factory ogled women and remarked on their clothes, the complaints said, leading some women to wear baggy outfits and use stacks of boxes to obstruct the views of leering co-workers. Some of the women claimed they were retaliated against when they came forward. The friend told Insider that if anyone else was mistreated by Musk, she hopes they will publicly tell their story. If there are other victims, she said, ""I would like for them to come forward. I would like for the truth to be revealed.""

Photograph: JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images  Elon Musk has said he would reverse Twitter’s decision to ban former US president Donald Trump from the platform, describing the decision as “morally wrong and outright stupid”. “I would reverse the permanent ban — but I don’t own Twitter yet,” Musk said, adding that he had spoken to Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey about the platform having “permabans” on users that violate its content policies. “It was not correct to ban Donald Trump; I think that was a mistake,” the Tesla chief executive added in an interview with the Financial Times. Musk said the decision, made in the wake of the January 6 riots following Trump’s election loss, “alienated a large part of the country”. That sort of alienation “could be frankly worse” than a single forum where everyone can debate. “It doesn’t end Trump’s voice. It will amplify it among the right. That’s why it’s morally wrong and outright stupid,” he added. Separately, China is expected to represent about 25 per cent to 30 per cent of Tesla’s market in the long-term, Musk said, but ruled out more factories there for now. In setting up Tesla’s Shanghai factory, Musk said he had indicated to the Chinese government they would not be doing a locally-owned plant. “Things are proceeding fairly well,” he continued. Musk also said Tesla was “not expecting to open any additional plants” in China in the “near future”, but would be expanding its Shanghai factory and also focusing production on other plants that have been completed in Austin, Texas, and Berlin, Germany. © 2023 The Irish Times DAC © 2023 The Irish Times DAC"

Elon Musk is expected to become Twitter’s temporary CEO after closing his $US44 billion ($62 billion) takeover of the social-media firm, a person familiar with the matter said, as the billionaire inches closer to securing funds for the deal. Musk, the world’s richest man, is also the CEO at Tesla and heads two other ventures, The Boring Company and SpaceX. Elon Musk was accused of bullying Twitter’s top lawyer.Credit: AP  Tesla shares dropped over 8 per cent on Thursday, as investors fretted that Musk’s involvement with Twitter could distract him from running the world’s most valuable electric-car maker. Twitter shares, on the other hand, extended gains and were up about 1.8 per cent at $US50.00, closer to the deal price of $US54.20, as investors bet that the new funding made the completion of the deal more likely. Parag Agrawal, who was named Twitter’s CEO in November, is expected to remain in his role until the sale of the company to Musk is completed. CNBC first reported on Thursday that Musk plans to become CEO of Twitter on an interim basis. Earlier on Thursday, Musk listed a group of high-profile investors who are ready to provide funding of $US7.14 billion ($10 billion) for his Twitter bid, including Oracle’s co-founder Larry Ellison and Sequoia Capital. Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who had said last month that the deal price was not sufficient for him to sell his shares, said Musk would be an “excellent leader” for Twitter and agreed to roll his $US1.89 billion stake into the deal. “Great to connect with you my “new” friend @elonmusk ... Kingdom Holding Company and I look forward to roll our ~$US1.9 bn in the “new” Twitter,” Alwaleed said in a tweet. Musk increased the financing commitment to $US27.25 billion, which includes commitments from 19 investors, while reducing a margin loan from Morgan Stanley to $US6.25 billion. He has already secured commitments for $US13 billion in loans. The other investors include crypto firm Binance, New York-based real estate tycoon Steven Witkoff’s firm and DFJ Growth IV Partners, which has investments in the Boring Company, SpaceX, SolarCity and Tesla. “We hope to be able to play a role in bringing social media and web3 together and broadening the use and adoption of crypto and blockchain technology,” Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said. Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who initially expressed reservations about Musk’s takeover, has agreed to roll his nearly $US2b stake into the deal. Credit: AP Reuters reported on Monday that Musk was in talks with large investment firms and high-net-worth individuals about taking on more financing for his Twitter acquisition and tying up less of his wealth in the deal. Musk will continue to hold talks with existing shareholders of Twitter, including the company’s former chief Jack Dorsey, to contribute shares to the proposed acquisition, according to a regulatory filing. Larry Ellison, a board member at Tesla and a self-described close friend of Musk, has committed $US1 billion for the funding. Musk, a self-proclaimed free speech absolutist who has advocated user-friendly tweaks to Twitter, such as an edit button and defeating “spam bots” that send overwhelming amounts of unwanted tweets, has previously said he would try to keep as many investors in Twitter as possible. Investors have been fretting over whether Musk will complete the Twitter deal. In April, he decided at the last minute not to take up a seat on Twitter’s board. In 2018, Musk tweeted that there was “funding secured” for a $US72 billion deal to take Tesla private but did not move ahead with an offer. Musk would have to pay a $US1 billion termination fee to Twitter if he walked away, and the social media company could also sue him to complete the deal.

Similar emails were sent to SpaceX, according to The New York Times. Musk said in two separate emails that people must show up for at least 40 hours per week in a main Tesla office. ""If you don't show up, we will assume you have resigned,"" he said in one of the emails, first reported by Electrek and also obtained by CNBC. ""Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla,"" Musk said in the first email, according to Electrek. ""This is less than we ask of factory workers."" ""If there are particularly exceptional contributors for whom this is impossible, I will review and approve those exceptions directly,"" the email continued. ""There are of course companies that don't require this, but when was the last time they shipped a great new product? It's been a while,"" Musk wrote in the second email sent. He added that it's important for senior employees to show their presence and said it's why he ""lived in the factory so much"" and that, had he not, ""Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt."" ""Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth. This will not happen by phoning it in,"" he added. Responding to an inquiry about the leaked emails from a Twitter account known for promoting the CEO and Tesla, Musk said: ""They should pretend to work somewhere else."" The outspoken CEO is known for his intense work expectations, especially of factory workers, pushing them to meet extremely ambitious production goals. For example, when Covid numbers were rising in California in April 2020, Musk called health restrictions ""fascist"" in a rant during a company earnings call. He also kept his company's Fremont, California, plant operating despite health orders but faced no repercussions from the state or Alameda County.

In an effort to retain talent during what's been dubbed the ""Great Resignation,"" employers such as Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Meta allow at least some remote work, depending on the employees' position and location. By contrast, some big tech employers including Atlassian and Airbnb now allow remote work year-round. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Here's one of Musk's emails, as transcribed by CNBC: From: Elon MuskTo: ""Everybody""Tue. 5/31/2022 [time stamp redacted]Subj: To be super clear Everyone at Tesla is required to spend a minimum of forty hours in the office per week. Moreover, the office must be where your actual colleagues are located, not some remote pseudo-office.

Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News          Elon Musk is demanding that Tesla office workers return to in-person work or leave the company.
   
      The policy, disclosed in leaked emails Musk sent to Tesla’s executive staff Tuesday, was first reported by electric vehicle news site Electrek. 
   
      “Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla. This is less than we ask of factory workers,” Musk wrote, adding that the office must be the employee’s primary workplace where the other workers they regularly interact with are based — “not a remote branch office unrelated to the job duties.”
   
      Musk said he would personally review any request for exemption from the policy, but that for the most part, “If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned.”
   
      Tesla
            
                (TSLA), which had 100,000 workers worldwide at the start of the year, did not respond to a request for comment on the policy change, but Musk appeared to confirm it in a tweet of his own early Wednesday when asked on Twitter, “Hey Elon…any additional comment to people who think coming into work is an antiquated concept?” Musk replied: “They should pretend to work somewhere else.”
   
Slack CEO: 'Days of 9 to 5, Monday to Friday are over'        The policy is completely at odds with that of the other tech company Musk is attempting to buy, Twitter
            
                (TWTR), which has previously announced employees can continue to work from home “forever” if they prefer. “Wherever you feel most productive and creative is where you will work and that includes working from home full-time forever,” CEO Parag Agrawal wrote in a note to Twitter
            
                (TWTR)’s roughly 7,500 employees in March, just before Musk’s interest in owning the social media platform was disclosed.
   
      At Tesla, however, that won’t be the case. It’s especially important that senior managers be seen in the office, Musk said, adding that was one of the reasons he essentially lived at the Tesla factory in Fremont, California, when the company was struggling to increase production in 2017 and 2018.
   
      “If I had not done that, Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt,” he wrote. “There are of course companies that don’t require this, but when was the last time they shipped a great new product? It’s been a while.”
   
      He added, “Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth,” he added. “This will not happen by phoning it in.”
   
A shorter work week, cash to invest: Companies add perks to attract workers        Surveys show the majority of office workers prefer the option to work from home. Since reopening offices following Covid-19 shutdowns, many companies beyond Twitter have announced increased flexibility for employees who want to work remotely, partly as a way to retain or attract talent in a particularly tight labor market. But the world’s richest person doesn’t seem concerned about that dynamic.
   
  Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the number of employees at Tesla. The company has 100,000 workers worldwide.

The emails said staff should report to work at one of the company's main offices, ""not a remote branch office unrelated to the job duties"".  Mr Musk added that he would personally review any requests for exemptions from the policy. Mr Musk said working in the office full-time was what the company asks of its factory employees and in-person collaboration was critical to the firm's success. ""There are of course companies that don't require this, but when was the last time they shipped a great new product? It's been a while,"" he said in an email, one of two that was leaked and shared on social media. ""Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth. This will not happen by phoning it in."" Companies in many industries are wrestling with whether to allow the remote work practices that exploded during the coronavirus pandemic to continue. Some sectors, such as banking, signalled early on that they would expect staff to return to the office, while others, often in the tech industry, have said they will allow remote work indefinitely. Many places have opted for a mix. Office occupancy in the US is at about 43%, according to data from Kastle, which runs security card access systems at thousands of buildings across the country. Mr Musk is famously hard charging in his own attitude to work. He rarely takes holidays and during a crunch period for Tesla a few years ago, he slept on the factory floor. ""The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence,"" he wrote in one of the emails on the remote work policy. ""That is why I lived in the factory so much - so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt."" Mr Musk was previously on the record as having a dim view of remote work, writing on Twitter earlier this year that ""all the Covid stay-at-home stuff has tricked people into thinking that you don't actually need to work hard. Rude awakening inbound!"" His comments raised the potential for a fresh clash of cultures with the staff at Twitter, which he is in the process of buying for $44bn (£35.3bn). In March, the firm's chief executive Parag Agrawal said staff could continue to work from home ""forever"". In a note to employees posted on the social media platform, Mr Agrawal said ""As we open back up, our approach remains the same. Wherever you feel most productive and creative is where you will work and that includes working from home full-time forever."" ""Office every day? That works too.

In an email, Musk said he would directly review and approve any requests for exemption from the company's return-to-work policy, but emphasized to his staff: ""If you don't show up, we will assume you have resigned."" ""Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth. This will not happen by phoning it in,"" Musk added. Tesla did not respond to NPR's immediate requests for comment. However, in a reply to one user on Twitter who asked Musk about the leaked emails, he responded back saying, ""They should pretend to work somewhere else.""  They should pretend to work somewhere else The billionaire has been vocal against his stance against remote work, criticizing Americans and their work ethic in the past.  During an interview with Financial Times, Musk said that Americans are trying to ""avoid going to work at all,"" making the comparison to Chinese factory workers who work hard and ""won't even leave the factory.""

A message sent to executives on Thursday laid out his concerns and told them to ""pause all hiring worldwide."" The dire outlook came two days after the billionaire told staff to return to the workplace or leave and adds to a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders about the risks of recession. Tesla shares fell 9% in U.S. trade on Friday after the Reuters report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) was down about 2%. In another email to employees on Friday, Musk said Tesla will be reducing salaried headcount by 10%, as it has become ""overstaffed in many areas."" But ""hourly headcount will increase,"" he said. ""Note, this does not apply to anyone actually building cars, battery packs or installing solar,"" Musk wrote in the email seen by Reuters. Almost 100,000 people were employed at Tesla and its subsidiaries at the end of 2021, its annual SEC filing showed. It did not break down numbers of salaried and hourly workers. The Texas-based company was not immediately available for comment. Musk has warned in recent weeks about the risks of recession, but his email ordering a hiring freeze and staff cuts was the most direct and high-profile message of its kind from the head of an automaker, with others describing sky high demand.  read more  ""Elon Musk has a uniquely informed insight into the global economy. We believe that a message from him would carry high credibility,"" Adam Jonas, an analyst Morgan Stanley, said in a report. So far, demand for Tesla cars and other electric vehicles (EV) has remained strong and many traditional indicators of a downturn - including increasing dealer inventories and incentives in the United States - have not materialized. But Tesla has struggled to restart production at its Shanghai factory after COVID-19 lockdowns forced costly outages. ""It is always better to introduce austerity measures in good times than in bad times. I see the statements as a forewarning and a precautionary measure,"" said Hanover-based NordLB analyst Frank Schwope. Musk's gloomy outlook echoes recent comments from executives including JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs President John Waldron.

It was also not immediately clear what implication, if any, Musk's view would have for his $44 billion bid for Twitter (TWTR.N). U.S. antitrust regulators cleared the way for the deal on Friday, sending Twitter shares up 2%.  read more  Several analysts have cut price targets for Tesla recently, forecasting lost output at its Shanghai plant, a hub supplying EVs to China and for export. China accounted for just over a third of Tesla's global deliveries in 2021, according to company disclosures and data released on sales there. On Thursday, Daiwa Capital Markets estimated Tesla had about 32,000 orders awaiting delivery in China, compared to 600,000 vehicles for BYD (002594.SZ), its larger EV rival in that market. 'PAUSE ALL HIRING' Before Musk's warning, Tesla had about 5,000 job postings on LinkedIn from sales in Tokyo and engineers at its new Berlin gigafactory to deep learning scientists in Palo Alto. It had scheduled an online hiring event for Shanghai on June 9 on its WeChat channel. Musk's demand that staff return to the office has already faced pushback in Germany.  read more  And his plan to cut jobs would face resistance in the Netherlands, where Tesla has its European headquarters, a union leader said. ""You can't just fire Dutch workers,"" said FNV union spokesperson Hans Walthie, adding Tesla would have to negotiate with a labor union on terms for any departures. In a Tuesday email, Musk had said Tesla employees were required to be in the office for a minimum of 40 hours per week, closing the door on any remote work. ""If you don't show up, we will assume you have resigned,"" he said. Jason Stomel, founder of tech talent agency Cadre, said that the return-to-office memo could be a way to get people to leave. ""(Musk) knows there's a percentage of workers who are just not going to come back,"" which he said would be cheaper for Tesla because no severance would be needed. Musk has referred to the risk of a recession repeatedly in recent comments. Remotely addressing a conference in mid-May in Miami Beach, he said: ""I think we are probably in a recession and that recession will get worse."" Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin

In a complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, plaintiff Keith Johnson accused Musk, electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and space tourism company SpaceX of racketeering for touting Dogecoin and driving up its price, only to then let the price tumble. Musk is CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX. ""Defendants were aware since 2019 that Dogecoin had no value yet promoted Dogecoin to profit from its trading,"" the complaint said. ""Musk used his pedestal as World's Richest man to operate and manipulate the Dogecoin Pyramid Scheme for profit, exposure and amusement."" The complaint also aggregates comments from Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and others questioning the value of cryptocurrency.

He also wants to block Musk and his companies from promoting Dogecoin and a judge to declare that trading Dogecoin is gambling under federal and New York law.

He’s covered the tech industry for over a decade at The Information and other outlets. Elon Musk told Twitter employees on Thursday that the company needs to become more like WeChat and TikTok if it wants to achieve his goal of hitting 1 billion users. When asked how Twitter could grow its user base and increase engagement, Musk explained that the app should offer more utility and make sure “people are very entertained and informed,” according to employees who heard the remarks during his first internal all-hands. He drew a comparison to WeChat, the super app in China that mixes social media with payments, games, and even ride-hailing.  “There’s no WeChat equivalent outside of China,” Musk said after dialing in 10 minutes late to the virtual meeting via his phone camera. “You basically live on WeChat in China. If we can recreate that with Twitter, we’ll be a great success.” “I think Twitter can be much better about informing people of serious issues” He also complimented TikTok’s algorithm for not being “boring,” saying “we could hone Twitter in the same way to be interesting.” He specifically placed an emphasis on Twitter being better at surfacing news. “I think Twitter can be much better about informing people of serious issues,” he said. When asked what success for Twitter will look like in five to 10 years, Musk said the company should be “contributing to a stronger longer lasting civilization where we are better able to understand the nature of reality.” During the call, Musk reiterated that he wants Twitter to lean more heavily on subscriptions and payments, suggesting that people should pay to be verified. At one point, he suggested the idea of an “irony” label so that someone could show the intention behind a tweet.  He also repeated earlier comments about wanting to crack down on bots and spam, saying that “it needs to be much more expensive to have a troll army.” The Tesla CEO earlier threatened to scrap the deal over the bot issue, which spurred Twitter to give him extensive data access as a show of good faith. Altogether, Musk’s comments to Twitter employees Thursday suggest he will make sweeping changes to Twitter if his offer to take the company private goes through. He said he wants to make the company more financially disciplined but that he’s not totally against “exceptional” employees continuing to work from home. He demurred on whether he’d stay Twitter’s CEO after taking it over but made it clear that he’ll be deeply involved in the product and business. Towards the end of the call, Musk switched the topic to space, the age of the earth, and potential dead civilizations on other planets, saying he has seen “no actual evidence for aliens, yet.”  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

About 30% of US office workers are still working from home, according to Nick Bloom, a Stanford economics professor and co-founder of Working from Home Research Project. Many companies are moving to a hybrid work model where staff will come in two or three days a week. But the world’s richest man has apparently soured on the idea of his executives working from home. In a memo headlined “Remote work is no longer acceptble” [sic], Musk wrote that “anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla. This is less than we ask of factory workers.” Neither Musk nor Tesla have confirmed that he sent the memo but in a reply to a Twitter follower asking for “​​additional comment to people who think coming into work is an antiquated concept”, Musk wrote: “They should pretend to work somewhere else.” They should pretend to work somewhere else In the memo Musk said he would “review and approve” any cases where staff could not meet the minimum. Tesla joins a wave of companies mandating a return to office for employees. While some big employers have embraced voluntary work-from-home policies permanently, others including Alphabet’s Google are betting that it is best to push in-person interactions among colleagues. The news comes as Musk continues to pursue a takeover of Twitter, whose San Francisco office, he has suggested, could be turned into a “homeless shelter since no one show up anyway”. The Twitter chief executive, Parag Agrawal, tweeted in March that Twitter offices would be reopening but employees could still work from home if they wanted to. “Wherever you feel most productive and creative is where you will work and that includes working from home full-time forever,” Agrawal said in a tweet.

From artillery strikes to Zoom calls,the tech billionaire’s internet service has become a lifeline in the war with Russia. By Christopher Miller, Mark Scott and Bryan Bender Illustration by Matthew Holland for POLITICO Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence. KHARKIV REGION, Ukraine  Every time Oleksiy and his fellow artillerymen hit a Russian target, they have one person to thank: Elon Musk, the world’s richest man.  Embedded in a frontline hot zone just south of the strategic town of Izyum in Ukraine’s war-ravaged east, Oleksiy — who declined to give his last name for security reasons — is now a power-user of Starlink, a satellite communication system owned by Musk’s SpaceX.  When planning a counterattack or artillery barrage, he dials up his superiors for last-minute orders via a rectangular white-and-gray Starlink satellite receiver concealed in a shallow pit in the garden of an abandoned cottage. The high-tech equipment is wired to a noisy generator that runs half of the day. It’s not just about military communications. Others in Ukraine’s 93rd mechanized brigade let friends and family know they are safe through daily encrypted satellite messages after the local cellphone network was severed weeks ago during heavy shelling. In their downtime, Oleksiy and his comrades keep tabs on the latest developments in the war via Starlink’s internet connection and — when there’s a lull between artillery duels — play “Call of Duty” on their smartphones while sheltering in bunkers and standing by for orders. “Thank you, Elon Musk,” said Oleksiy soon after logging on through Starlink’s satellites to discover the Biden administration would be sending long-range rockets to the Ukrainian army in its fight with the Russians. “This is exactly what we need,” he added in reference to the rockets.  The first 100 days of Russia’s invasion of its western neighbor have left thousands dead and even more injured. Ukrainian forces now find themselves in a war of attrition with the Russian army that, despite setbacks in and around Kyiv, continues to chip away at local resistance in the country’s east. The United States, European Union and other NATO countries have donated billions of dollars in military equipment to Ukraine since the war began in late February. But Musk’s Starlink — based on a cluster of table-sized satellites flying as low as 130 miles above Ukraine and beaming down high-speed internet access — has become an unexpected lifeline to the country, both on the battlefield and in the war for public opinion. Ukrainian drones have relied on Starlink to drop bombs on Russian forward positions. People in besieged cities near the Russian border have stayed in touch with loved ones via the encrypted satellites. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the country’s president, has regularly updated his millions of social media followers on the back of Musk’s network, as well as holding Zoom calls with global politicians from U.S. President Joe Biden to French leader Emmanuel Macron. The Ukrainian troops who held out in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol were able to maintain contact with their commanders and even Zelenskyy — and conduct live video interviews with journalists — because they had a Starlink system in the besieged factory.  All told, Starlink — and Ukraine’s use of the satellite network, both for its military and civilians — has thwarted Russia’s efforts to cut the Eastern European country off from the outside world, giving Kyiv a much-needed victory against Moscow in a conflict that shows no sign of ending.  “The strategic impact is, it totally destroyed [Vladimir] Putin’s information campaign,” said Brig. Gen. Steve Butow, director of the space portfolio at the Defense Innovation Unit, the Pentagon’s Silicon Valley tech outpost. “He never, to this day, has been able to silence Zelenskyy.” The conflict in Ukraine also has provided Musk and SpaceX’s fledgling satellite network with a trial-by-fire that has whetted the appetite of many Western militaries. Commanders have been impressed by the company’s ability, within days, to deliver thousands of backpack-sized satellite stations to the war-torn country and to keep them online despite increasingly sophisticated attacks from Russian hackers. “We’ve got more than 11,000 Starlink stations and they help us in our everyday fight on all the fronts,” Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s vice prime minister, told POLITICO. “We’re ready, even if there is no light, no fixed internet, through generators using Starlink, to renew any connection in Ukraine.” Ukraine isn’t the only country to see the importance of satellite communication in the unfolding war in Eastern Europe. Just an hour before Russian troops launched their full-scale assault in the early hours of February 24, the Kremlin successfully hacked Viasat, an American satellite provider whose network was used by the Ukrainian military to communicate with front-line troops, according to intelligence reports from the U.S., EU and the United Kingdom. The cyberattack, which crippled the country’s military communications and also took out thousands of other internet users across Europe, fast-tracked negotiations, started in early 2022, between Kyiv and SpaceX to bring the satellite network to the country, according to four officials with knowledge of those discussions. Zelenskyy’s government had realized that internet access — both for the military and civilians — would be critical in the likely war to come. Soldiers needed a sure-fire way of staying in touch during the haze of war, and raw footage of Russian attacks, often uploaded by Ukrainians themselves via social media, has brought the conflict directly to people’s smartphones worldwide. SpaceX, whose goal is to launch more than 40,000 satellites into so-called low Earth orbit in the coming years, quickly positioned roughly 50 satellites ready to be used in the Eastern European country. But red tape, including official government approval needed to turn on the system, slowed down the rollout. Then, Russia attacked. Two days after the invasion, on February 26, Fedorov — the Ukrainian vice prime minister who doubles as the country’s digital minister — tweeted directly at Musk to urgently send Starlink equipment. Two days after that, the first shipment showed up. “They tweeted at Elon and so we turned it on,” Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX’s president, told an audience at the California Institute of Technology on March 7 in reference to Starlink’s arrival in Ukraine. “That was our permission. That was the letter from the minister. It was a tweet.” SpaceX did not respond to repeated requests for comment about its involvement in Ukraine. Starlink isn’t the first commercial satellite provider to be used on the battlefield. The U.S. military piggybacked on private networks during the first Gulf War — a tactic that has become a mainstay of conflict zones globally. But where the system — one of many low-orbit satellite networks, including a rival early-stage project from Amazon, currently under development — stands apart is its ability to withstand attacks from the Russians, according to three military officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, and two researchers who have studied Starlink. Unlike traditional high-orbit satellites, which orbit thousands of miles above the earth, hovering over one point on the ground and beaming down radio signals, the new generation of low-orbit satellites relies on many more satellites working in a constellation. That configuration makes it more difficult, if not impossible, to take offline because an attacker would have to pinpoint all the satellites, at once, to cripple the entire system. Starlink, too, is more adaptable than alternatives because each device’s computer code can be quickly altered in response to possible hacks. Last month, Musk said the Kremlin was “ramping up” its cyberattacks on his network, and SpaceX has repeatedly rewritten its code to keep one step ahead of Russia. Todd E. Humphreys, a professor at the University of Texas who has delved into Starlink’s inner workings and consulted with SpaceX and the U.S. military, said the system’s encryption technology also had proven more resilient than many had expected.  Together with the network’s other incremental tech advances, including providing high-speed internet from space that rivals people’s home broadband networks, Musk’s satellite system represents a step change in how satellites can be rolled out, and used, in conflict zones. “It’s a crystal clear example that secure backup communications is going to be the lifeline of any modern military engagement,” said Humphreys. “The nimbleness with which Starlink was set up in Ukraine was just astounding.” Like with everything to do with Musk — the enigmatic billionaire whose business interests include everything from Tesla, the electric car giant, to a bid for Twitter, the social network — just how the Starlink equipment made its way to Ukraine is shrouded in confusion and rumor.  Soon after the first equipment began arriving in Kyiv, the South African-born tech magnate, who has picked fights with others on social media and run afoul of financial regulators, briefly swapped texts with Fedorov, the Ukrainian politician. He also talked — powered by Starlink — with Zelenskyy via Zoom about the ongoing rollout and promised to visit Ukraine as soon as the war was over. In public statements, the company said funding for the satellite communication system in Ukraine — estimated to be around $15 million, with each satellite receiver, known as Dishy McFlatface, costing $499 a piece — came almost exclusively from private sources. SpaceX has pledged to pay for all internet access that, for those outside Ukraine, costs $110 a month.  Yet USAID said in early April it had bought over 1,300 satellite dishes as part of the Starlink project, with SpaceX donating a further 3,600 stations. The U.S. federal agency subsequently scrubbed references to how much equipment Washington had purchased from its press release, though it confirmed to POLITICO that it had shipped the equipment from the U.S. to Eastern Europe. A USAID spokesperson said the agency was grateful to SpaceX and other donors for contributing to the Starlink project.  Other Western allies, including the French and Polish governments, have also helped with logistical support, including handling the last-mile delivery of the equipment to Ukraine, according to two European officials with direct knowledge of those discussions. One of those officials added that a so-called ground station, or hardware that linked Starlink’s satellites with local internet infrastructure, was housed in neighboring Poland to avoid Russian attack. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  “The invasion happened on a Thursday and by the next day, Elon had called together a meeting and said, ‘I want to get Starlink up over Ukraine,’” said Butow of the U.S. Defense Innovation Unit. “By Sunday, the link was active. By Monday, 500 ground terminals showed up in Ukraine. By Wednesday of that week, all but 25 of those terminals were alive and providing real-time data,” he added. “That’s commercial speed. That’s amazing.” Not all of the Starlink equipment has arrived via official channels. For Alisa Kovalenko, who joined the Ukrainian military after Putin’s invasion and now fights with the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade near the Russian border in the northern Kharkiv region, her satellite dish was donated by a group of Ukrainian volunteers, who crowdfunded to buy the system and delivered it directly to the frontline. “There’s no communication for us with the outside world without Starlink,” Kovalenko told POLITICO by phone over a Starlink connection. “During the last weeks, we had no mobile connections because we moved in our sector from a town to a village. It was impossible to call with any mobile network.” Like everything on the frontline, her team’s Starlink has had its fair share of close calls — even as it gives both soldiers and civilians a direct connection with friends and family after Kovalenko’s comrades handed over Starlink’s password to locals so they could let relatives know they were safe.  Fuel to power the equipment is always in short supply. During a recent Russian artillery attack, the satellite dish was left exposed in a nearby field, and narrowly missed being destroyed. Whenever the soldiers move positions, they have to gently pull apart the high-tech equipment, putting the small components in a duffle bag and the dish in a waiting vehicle. But for Kovalenko, a documentary filmmaker, the ability to keep in touch with almost anyone in the world via Musk’s satellite system is a godsend, even if it’s a tricky balance to keep the equipment safe and operational in the middle of the ongoing war. “If there is bombing and you need to pack up fast and run, it still takes time to grab everything for the Starlink,” she said. “You have to be careful with it. It’s not just a pile of clothes which you can throw in the car.” Laurens Cerulus contributed reporting from Brussels. Log in to access content and manage your profile.

https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2022/06/21/elon-musk-tesla-job-cuts-reduce-workforce-tdn/7687556001/,Elon Musk says Tesla job cuts will reduce workforce by 3.5%,20220601,"Jun 21, 2022 ... Elon Musk confirmed the salaried workforce at Tesla Inc. would be cut by about 10% over the next three months, but said the overall ...","Elon Musk confirmed the salaried workforce at Tesla Inc. would be cut by about 10% over the next three months, but said the overall reduction in the electric-car maker’s headcount would only be about 3.5% as hourly staff numbers are still expected to grow. “We grew very fast on the salaried side,” Musk said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday. “A year from now, I think our headcount will be higher” in salaried and hourly workers, but for now the reduction will be 3% to 3.5%, he said. The comments brought more clarity to the situation with Tesla’s staffing, after Musk made varied internal and public statements about reductions over the past month. Tesla, now headquartered in Austin, Texas, has grown to about 100,000 employees globally, hiring rapidly as it built new factories in Austin and Berlin. The cuts, which have affected human resources representatives and software engineers so far, caught many by surprise, with several employees told they were being terminated immediately. Two workers at Tesla’s battery factory near Reno, Nevada, allege the company didn’t comply with the 60-day notification requirement under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, according to a lawsuit they filed late Sunday in federal court in Austin. “Let’s not read too much into a preemptive lawsuit that has no standing,” Musk said in Tuesday’s interview via video link.  The reductions come as Musk, 50, wades into the debate over work-from-home, a polarizing issue for employees and companies alike as they navigate the return to normality as the pandemic recedes. Earlier this month, the Tesla chieftain issued an ultimatum for staff at the company to return to the office — or leave.  “Everyone at Tesla is required to spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week,” Musk wrote in an email titled “To be super clear.” “Moreover, the office must be where your actual colleagues are located, not some remote pseudo office. If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned.” “The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence,” Musk wrote. “That is why I lived in the factory so much — so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt.” The mandate has also spooked workers at Twitter Inc., who have had a work-from-anywhere policy throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Before sealing his deal to buy the social-media platform, Musk floated the idea of turning its San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter because “no one shows up anyway.”  In contrast, he has praised workers at Tesla’s Shanghai factory. Many lived and worked on-site to keep production running through much of the Chinese city’s two-month COVID lockdown earlier this year.  “I am very impressed with the car companies in China, just in general companies in China,” Musk said Tuesday. “I think they’re extremely competitive, hard-working and smart.”  As for competition from the world’s leading automakers, Musk said Tesla doesn’t really think about possible rivals. The main issues the company face are to do with supply chains and its own production capacity.  “Demand for our cars is extremely high and the wait-list is long,” he said. “We really don’t think about competition — we just think about how do we address the limiting factors in the supply chain and in our own industrial capacity.” “Basically, we need to build the factories faster,” he said. “And then we need to look ahead to whatever the choke points are in the whole lithium-ion battery supply chain from mining and refining to cathode and anode production and cell formation.” Qatar’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Qatar Investment Authority and Investment Promotion Agency Qatar are the underwriters of the Qatar Economic Forum, Powered by Bloomberg. Media City Qatar is the host organization."

But Twitter's board chair Bret Taylor said the company is still committed to closing the deal at the agreed-upon price and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the agreement. ""We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery,"" Taylor wrote. Twitter shares were down about 6% after hours on Friday. In the letter, disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Skadden Arps attorney Mike Ringler said that ""Twitter has not complied with its contractual obligations."" Ringler claimed that Twitter did not provide Musk with relevant business information he requested, as Ringler said the contract would require. Musk has previously said he wanted to assess Twitter's claims that about 5% of its monetizable daily active users (mDAUs) are spam accounts. ""Twitter has failed or refused to provide this information,"" Ringler claimed. ""Sometimes Twitter has ignored Mr. Musk's requests, sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified, and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving Mr. Musk incomplete or unusable information."" Ringler also charged in the letter that Twitter breached the merger agreement because it allegedly contains ""materially inaccurate representations."" This accusation is based on Musk's own preliminary review of spam accounts on Twitter's platform. Twitter has said it's not possible to calculate spam accounts from solely public information and that a team of experts conducts a review to reach the 5% figure. ""While this analysis remains ongoing, all indications suggest that several of Twitter's public disclosures regarding its mDAUs are either false or materially misleading,"" Ringer alleged. ""Despite public speculation on this point, Mr. Musk did not waive his right to review Twitter's data and information simply because he chose not to seek this data and information before entering into the Merger Agreement,"" Ringer added. ""In fact, he negotiated access and information rights within the Merger Agreement precisely so that he could review data and information that is important to Twitter's business before financing and completing the transaction."" He also claimed Twitter breached its obligations under the agreement to get Musk's consent before changing its ordinary course of business, pointing to recent layoffs at the company. While Musk is now officially seeking to walk away from the deal, this saga is likely far from over. Under the terms of the agreement, Musk agreed to pay $1 billion if he backs out. But as Twitter's board chair indicated they would do, the company can seek to hold Musk to his original deal by suing him for walking away if they dispute that his reasoning should let him out of the contract. Twitter has reason to seek to hold Musk to his original terms. The stock has fallen considerably since the board announced it had accepted his offer to buy the company at $54.20 per share. On the day of that announcement, the stock ended the trading day at $51.70 per share. Twitter shares sat at $36.81 as of Friday's market close. Musk is apparently paying attention to the stock price, too, according to the letter, ""and is considering whether the company's declining business prospects and financial outlook constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect giving Mr. Musk a separate and distinct basis for terminating the Merger Agreement.""

Looking at Musk’s many companies, common themes stand out across three areas: what fits into his vision for problems to solve, how he designs an organization as a solution to those problems, and why he can so effectively mobilize resources towards those solutions. Musk seeks problems that require navigating scale and overcoming complexity. Organizationally, he favors vertical integration and closed systems. To finance his projects, he’s able to marshal tremendous resources because he has large personal stakes in his companies and is able to stir public and investor emotions, even if the logic of how a given business will succeed may not be clear. During Elon Musk’s dramatic, sometimes pugnacious, occasionally  baffling campaign to acquire Twitter, we heard many of the same questions from both his followers and his critics. Why did he want to buy the company in the first place, and what was he planning to do with it? Will he make a lot of money or will he lose all of it? Many questions simply boiled down to: “What is he thinking?!” Or, put another way, is Musk out there just winging this, or does he have a strategy? And if so, what is the Musk strategy?"

Elon Musk, the chief executive officer of Tesla and the world's richest person, said on Friday he was terminating his $44 billion deal to ...","July 8 (Reuters) - Elon Musk, the chief executive officer of Tesla (TSLA.O) and the world's richest person, said on Friday he was terminating his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter (TWTR.N) because the social media company had breached multiple provisions of the merger agreement. Twitter's chairman, Bret Taylor, said on the micro-blogging platform that the board planned to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement.  read more  ""The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk...,"" he wrote. In a filing, Musk's lawyers said Twitter had failed or refused to respond to multiple requests for information on fake or spam accounts on the platform, which is fundamental to the company's business performance. ""Twitter is in material breach of multiple provisions of that Agreement, appears to have made false and misleading representations upon which Mr. Musk relied when entering into the Merger Agreement,"" the filing said. Musk also said he was walking away because Twitter fired high-ranking executives and one-third of the talent acquisition team, breaching Twitter's obligation to ""preserve substantially intact the material components of its current business organization."" Musk's decision is likely to result in a protracted legal tussle between the billionaire and the 16-year-old San Francisco-based company. Disputed mergers and acquisitions that land in Delaware courts more often than not end up with the companies re-negotiating deals or the acquirer paying the target a settlement to walk away, rather than a judge ordering that a transaction be completed. That is because target companies are often keen to resolve the uncertainty around their future and move on. Twitter, however, is hoping that court proceedings will start in a few weeks and be resolved in a few months, according to a person familiar with the matter. There is plenty of precedent for a deal renegotiation. Several companies repriced agreed acquisitions when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in 2020 and delivered a global economic shock.

REUTERS/Mike Blake  Acquire Licensing Rights In one instance, French retailer LVMH (LVMH.PA) threatened to walk away from a deal with Tiffany & Co. The U.S. jewelry retailer agreed to lower the acquisition price by $425 million to $15.8 billion. ""I'd say Twitter is well-positioned legally to argue that it provided him with all the necessary information and this is a pretext to looking for any excuse to get out of the deal,"" said Ann Lipton, associate dean for faculty research at Tulane Law School. Shares of Twitter were down 6% at $34.58 in extended trading. That is 36% below the $54.20 per share Musk agreed to buy Twitter for in April. Twitter's shares surged after Musk took a stake in the company in early April, shielding it from a deep stock market sell-off that slammed other social media platforms. But after he agreed on April 25 to buy Twitter, the stock within a matter of days began to fall as investors speculated Musk might walk away from the deal. With its tumble after the bell on Friday, Twitter was trading at its lowest since March. The announcement is another twist in a will-he-won't-he saga after Musk clinched the deal to purchase Twitter in April but then put the buyout on hold until the social media company proved that spam bots account for less than 5% of its total users. The contract calls for Musk to pay Twitter a $1 billion break-up if he cannot complete the deal for reasons such as the acquisition financing falling through or regulators blocking the deal. The break-up fee would not be applicable, however, if Musk terminates the deal on his own. Some employees expressed disbelief and exhaustion on Friday, publicly posting memes on Twitter, such as of a rollercoaster ride and a baby screaming into a phone, in apparent commentary on the breakup. Employees have worried about the deal will mean for their jobs, pay and ability to work remotely, and many have expressed skepticism about Musk's plans to loosen content moderation.  read more  Musk's abandonment of the deal and Twitter's promise to vigorously fight to complete it casts a pall of uncertainty over the company's future and its stock price during a time when worries about rising interest rates and a potential recession have hammered Wall Street. Shares of online advertising rivals Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Meta Platforms (META.O), Snap (SNAP.N) and Pinterest (PINS.N) have seen their stocks tumble 45% on average in 2022, while Twitter's stock has declined just 15% in that time, buoyed in recent months by the Musk deal. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, said Musk's filing was bad news for Twitter. ""This is a disaster scenario for Twitter and its Board as now the company will battle Musk in an elongated court battle to recoup the deal and/or the breakup fee of $1 billion at a minimum,"" he wrote in a note to clients.

Elon Musk is seeking to end his $44bn (£36bn) bid to buy Twitter, alleging multiple breaches ...","Elon Musk is seeking to end his $44bn (£36bn) bid to buy Twitter, alleging multiple breaches of the agreement. The announcement is the latest twist in a long-running saga after the world's richest person decided to buy Twitter in April. Mr Musk said he had backed out because Twitter failed to provide enough information on the number of spam and fake accounts.  Twitter says it plans to pursue legal action to enforce the agreement.  ""The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk,"" Twitter chairman Bret Taylor wrote in a tweet, setting up a potentially long and protracted legal battle between the two sides.  The original merger agreement includes a $1bn (£830m) break-up fee.  In May, Mr Musk said the deal was ""temporarily on hold"" as he was awaiting data on the number of fake and spam accounts on Twitter. The billionaire businessman had asked for evidence to back the company's assertion that spam and bot accounts make up less than 5% of its total users.  In a letter filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr Musk's lawyer said Twitter had failed or refused to provide this information. ""Sometimes Twitter has ignored Mr. Musk's requests, sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified, and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving Mr. Musk incomplete or unusable information,"" the letter reads.  Spam accounts are designed to spread information to large numbers of people and manipulate the way they interact with the platform. On Thursday, Twitter said it removed around 1 million such accounts each day.  Mr Musk believes that spam or bot accounts could account for 20% or more of Twitter users.  Shares in Twitter fell by 7% in extended trading after the announcement.  Elon Musk has for weeks been trying to get information about how many daily active users Twitter has. Twitter has a problem with bots. In fact only yesterday it said it removed a million spam accounts a day. In a filing, Mr Musk said he'd repeatedly been refused information about the number of bot accounts on Twitter - which is why he wished to terminate the deal. Elon Musk though has already put pen to paper on this deal, and it is not totally clear whether he can back out at this stage. Mr Musk will need to prove that Twitter breached their agreement. There are other potential reasons why Mr Musk might want to pull out of the deal. The stock market price for large tech companies has fallen steeply in the last few months - did Musk offer too much? And then there was the impact the potential merger was having on Mr Musk's other companies. Tesla's share price has fallen significantly since he announced his interest in Twitter. His position on free speech and how Twitter might moderate in the future - based on the laws of individual countries - also at times came across as naïve. Did Elon Musk ultimately decide he had bitten off more than he could chew? Read more from James here Mr Musk, said to be the world's richest person, is the founder of rocket company SpaceX and CEO of electric car company Tesla. A self-described ""free speech absolutist"", he had pledged to loosen Twitter's content moderation rules once the company was under his ownership.

Twitter is suing billionaire Elon Musk to try to force him to buy the social media firm, ...","Twitter is suing billionaire Elon Musk to try to force him to buy the social media firm, setting up a legal battle with the world's richest man.  It comes after Mr Musk announced he was walking away from his proposed $44bn (£37bn) takeover of Twitter on Friday. He claimed Twitter had not given information about the number of fake and spam accounts on the platform. Now Twitter has asked a Delaware court to order Mr Musk to complete the merger at the agreed $54.20 per Twitter share. ""Having mounted a public spectacle to put Twitter in play, and having proposed and then signed a seller-friendly merger agreement, [Mr] Musk apparently believes that he - unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law - is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away,"" said the lawsuit. The lawsuit went on to accuse Mr Musk of ""a long list"" of violations of the merger agreement that ""have cast a pall over Twitter and its business"". Twitter chairman Bret Taylor tweeted that the microblogging site wanted ""to hold Elon Musk accountable to his contractual obligations"". Mr Musk tweeted on Tuesday: ""Oh the irony lol [laughing out loud]."" The lawsuit said Mr Musk, who is also boss of electric car company Tesla, had backed out of the deal because it ""no longer serves his personal interests"". The lawsuit said that after Mr Musk agreed to the deal, the stock market fell, along with Tesla shares. ""The value of Mr Musk's stake in Tesla, the anchor of his personal wealth, has declined by more than $100bn from its November 2021 peak. So [Mr] Musk wants out,"" it said. ""Rather than bear the cost of the market downturn, as the merger agreement requires, [Mr] Musk wants to shift it to Twitter's stockholders,"" it added. Twitter's share price has fallen more than 8% in the past month, and in May tumbled from highs of more than $50 per share, as Mr Musk questioned the number of fake and spam accounts on Twitter and said the deal was ""temporarily on hold"". On Friday, Mr Musk said he was pulling out of the deal, claiming a lack of information about spam accounts and inaccurate representations amounted to a ""material adverse event"". He also said Twitter sacking executives meant it was not living up to its obligations. In response, Twitter said it planned to pursue legal action to enforce the agreement, saying it was ""committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr Musk"". The original merger agreement includes a $1bn break-up fee. Elon Musk is a man who is being dragged, reluctantly, up the aisle.  The lawsuit uses the word ""consummation"" 55 times.  Mr Musk says he no longer wants to buy the company. But in contract law, that's easier said than done. In reality he has already entered into a legally binding agreement with Twitter which may be difficult to unpick.  And this lawsuit confirms that Twitter is hellbent on forcing the marriage to go ahead.  The price Mr Musk agreed to pay for the company is considerably more than its current valuation. It's now down to Mr Musk to prove that Twitter is in breach of contract - a tough ask.  The world's richest person is now faced with the bizarre prospect of having to buy a company he doesn't want to acquire. There are other possible outcomes here too. Mr Musk could of course win, which would be a devastating blow for the social media firm.  But this could also be the first move in a game of chess, an analogy that Elon Musk seemingly referenced in a tweet last week.  Twitter could be pushing for a settlement, a lump sum for them to agree to walk away. Mr Musk could also be looking for a revised, better price for Twitter. But whatever happens Elon Musk, by getting a little too close to Twitter, has tied himself in legal knots.  Mr Musk, a self-described ""free speech absolutist"", had pledged to loosen Twitter's content moderation rules once the company was under his ownership. He has been a vocal critic of Twitter banning some accounts, such as that of former US President Donald Trump. Mr Musk has also called for more transparency over how the platform presents tweets to users - a system that currently allows some to be promoted and given wider audiences. Twitter shares rose by more than 4% in New York on Tuesday and added 1% in after-hours trade. However the shares are still around $20 lower than Mr Musk's offer price of $54.20.

Space Exploration Technologies Corp., commonly referred to as SpaceX, is an American spacecraft manufacturer, launch service provider, defense contractor and satellite communications company headquartered in Hawthorne, California. The company was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and to colonize Mars. The company currently operates the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets along with the Dragon spacecraft. 
The company offers internet service via its Starlink satellites, which became the largest-ever satellite constellation in January 2020 and as of November 2023 comprised more than 5,000 small satellites in orbit.[7] 
Meanwhile, the company is developing Starship, a human-rated, fully-reusable, super heavy-lift launch system for interplanetary and orbital spaceflight. On its failed first flight in April 2023, it became the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown. No further Starship test flights had taken place at least until early November 2023.  
SpaceX is the first private company to develop a liquid-propellant rocket that has reached orbit; to launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft; to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station; and to send astronauts to the International Space Station. It is also the first organization of any type to achieve a vertical propulsive landing of an orbital rocket booster and the first to reuse such a booster. The company's Falcon 9 rockets have landed and reflown more than 200 times.[8] 
In early 2001, Elon Musk donated US$100,000 to the Mars Society and joined its board of directors for a short time.[9]: 30–31  He gave a plenary talk at their fourth convention where he announced Mars Oasis, a project to land a greenhouse and grow plants on Mars.[10][11] Musk initially attempted to acquire a Dnepr ICBM for the project through Russian contacts from Jim Cantrell.[12] 
When Musk returned to Moscow, Russia, with Michael Griffin, they found the Russians increasingly unreceptive.[13][14] On the flight home Musk announced he could start a company to build the affordable rockets they needed instead.[14] By applying vertical integration,[13] using cheap commercial off-the-shelf components when possible,[14] and adopting the modular approach of modern software engineering, Musk believed SpaceX could significantly cut launch price.[14] Griffin would later be appointed NASA administrator,[15] and play a part in the formation of the COTS program.[16][17] 
In early 2002, Musk started to look for staff for his company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached five people for the initial positions at the fledgling company, including Michael Griffin who was offered the position of Chief Engineer, Jim Cantrel and John Garvey (Cantrel and Garvey would later found the company Vector Launch), rocket engineer Tom Mueller, and Chris Thompson.[18][19] SpaceX was first headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California. Early SpaceX employees, such as Tom Mueller (CTO), Gwynne Shotwell (COO), and Chris Thompson (VP of Operations), came from neighboring TRW and Boeing corporations. By November 2005, the company had 160 employees.[20] Musk personally interviewed and approved all of SpaceX's early employees.[21]
Musk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten.[22] 
SpaceX developed its first orbital launch vehicle, the Falcon 1, with internal funding.[23][24]
The Falcon 1 was an expendable two-stage-to-orbit small-lift launch vehicle.
The total development cost of Falcon 1 was approximately $90 million[25] to $100 million.[26] The Falcon rocket series was named after Star Wars's Millennium Falcon fictional spacecraft.[27] 
In 2004, SpaceX protested against NASA to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) because of a sole-source contract awarded to Kistler Aerospace. As a result of the protest the GAO sided with SpaceX, NASA withdrew the contract, and formed the COTS program.[28][29] In 2005, SpaceX announced plans to pursue a human-rated commercial space program through the end of the decade, a program that would later become the Dragon spacecraft.[30]
In 2006, the company was selected by NASA and awarded $396 million to provide crew and cargo resupply demonstration contracts to the ISS under the COTS program.[31] 
The first two Falcon 1 launches were purchased by the United States Department of Defense under a program that evaluates new US launch vehicles suitable for use by DARPA.[24][32][33] The first three launches of the rocket, between 2006 and 2008, all resulted in failures, which almost ended the company. Financing for Tesla Motors had failed, as well,[34] and consequently Tesla, SolarCity, and Musk personally were all nearly bankrupt at the same time.[35] Musk was reportedly ""waking from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain"" because of the stress.[36] 
The financial situation started to turn around with the first successful launch achieved on the fourth attempt on 28 September 2008. Musk split his remaining $30 million between SpaceX and Tesla, and NASA awarded the first Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract awarding $1.6 billion to SpaceX in December, thus financially saving the company.[37] Based on these factors and the further business operations they enabled, the Falcon 1 was soon retired following its second successful, and fifth total, launch in July 2009; this allowed SpaceX to focus company resources on the development of a larger orbital rocket, the Falcon 9.[38] Gwynne Shotwell was also promoted to company president at this time, for her role in successfully negotiating the CRS contract.[39] 
SpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity vehicle, the Falcon 5.[40] The company instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of the Falcon 9, a reusable heavier lift vehicle. Development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated by NASA, which committed to purchasing several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. This started with seed money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006.[41]
The overall contract award was $278 million to provide development funding for the Dragon spacecraft, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon.[41]
As part of this contract, the Falcon 9 launched for the first time in June 2010 with the Dragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit, using a mockup of the Dragon spacecraft. 
The first operational Dragon spacecraft was launched in December 2010 aboard COTS Demo Flight 1, the Falcon 9's second flight, and safely returned to Earth after two orbits, completing all its mission objectives.[42] By December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 and Dragon every three months.[43] 
In April 2011, as part of its second-round Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, NASA issued a $75 million contract for SpaceX to develop an integrated launch escape system for Dragon in preparation for human-rating it as a crew transport vehicle to the ISS.[44] NASA awarded SpaceX a fixed-price Space Act Agreement (SAA) to produce a detailed design of the crew transportation system in August 2012.[45] 
In early 2012, approximately two-thirds of SpaceX stock was owned by Musk[46] and his seventy million shares were then estimated to be worth $875 million on private markets,[47] valuing SpaceX at $1.3 billion.[48] In May 2012, with the Dragon C2+ launch Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.[49]
After the flight, the company private equity valuation nearly doubled to $2.4 billion or $20/share.[50][51] By that time, SpaceX had operated on total funding of approximately $1 billion over its first decade of operation. Of this, private equity provided approximately $200 million, with Musk investing approximately $100 million and other investors having put in about $100 million.[52] 
SpaceX's active reusability test program began in late 2012 with testing low-altitude, low-speed aspects of the landing technology.[53] The Falcon 9 prototypes performed vertical takeoffs and landings (VTOL). High-velocity, high-altitude tests of the booster atmospheric return technology began in late 2013.[53] 
SpaceX launched the first commercial mission for a private customer in 2013. In 2014, SpaceX won nine contracts out of the 20 that were openly competed worldwide.[54]
That year Arianespace requested that European governments provide additional subsidies to face the competition from SpaceX.[55][56]
Beginning in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and pricing also began to affect the market for launch of U.S. military payloads, which for nearly a decade had been dominated by the large U.S. launch provider United Launch Alliance (ULA).[57]
The monopoly had allowed launch costs by the U.S. provider to rise to over $400 million over the years.[58]
In September 2014, NASA’s Director of Commercial Spaceflight, Kevin Crigler, awarded SpaceX the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contract to finalize the development of the Crew Transportation System. The contract included several technical and certification milestones, an uncrewed flight test, a crewed flight test, and six operational missions after certification.[45] 
In January 2015, SpaceX raised $1 billion in funding from Google and Fidelity, in exchange for 8.33% of the company, establishing the company valuation at approximately $12 billion.[59]
The same month SpaceX announced the development of a new satellite constellation, called Starlink, to provide global broadband internet service with 4,000 satellites.[60] 
The Falcon 9 had its first major failure in late June 2015, when the seventh ISS resupply mission, CRS-7 exploded two minutes into the flight. The problem was traced to a failed 2-foot-long steel strut that held a helium pressure vessel, which broke free due to the force of acceleration. This caused a breach and allowed high-pressure helium to escape into the low-pressure propellant tank, causing the failure.[61] 
SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015 with Falcon 9 Flight 20.[62]
In April 2016, the company achieved the first successful landing on the autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS) Of Course I Still Love You in the Atlantic Ocean.[63]
By October 2016, following the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they were offering their customers a 10% price discount if they choose to fly their payload on a reused Falcon 9 first stage.[64] 
A second major rocket failure happened in early September 2016, when a Falcon 9 exploded during a propellant fill operation for a standard pre-launch static fire test. The payload, the AMOS-6 communications satellite valued at $200 million, was destroyed.[65] The explosion was caused by the liquid oxygen that is used as propellant turning so cold that it solidified and ignited with carbon composite helium vessels.[66] Though not considered an unsuccessful flight, the rocket explosion sent the company into a four-month launch hiatus while it worked out what went wrong. SpaceX returned to flight in January 2017.[67] 
Later that year, in March 2017, SpaceX launched a returned Falcon 9 for the SES-10 satellite. This was the first time a re-launch of a payload-carrying orbital rocket went back to space.[68] The first stage was recovered again, also making it the first landing of a reused orbital class rocket.[69] 
In July 2017, the company raised $350 million, which raised its valuation to $21 billion.[70]
In 2017, SpaceX achieved a 45% global market share for awarded commercial launch contracts.[71]
By March 2018, SpaceX had more than 100 launches on its manifest representing about $12 billion in contract revenue.[72] The contracts included both commercial and government (NASA/DOD) customers.[73] This made SpaceX the leading global commercial launch provider measured by manifested launches.[74] 
In 2017, SpaceX formed a subsidiary, The Boring Company,[75] and began work to construct a short test tunnel on and adjacent to the SpaceX headquarters and manufacturing facility, using a small number of SpaceX employees,[76] which was completed in May 2018,[77] and opened to the public in December 2018.[78] During 2018, The Boring Company was spun out into a separate corporate entity with 6% of the equity going to SpaceX, less than 10% to early employees, and the remainder of the equity to Elon Musk.[78] 
In January 2019, SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce to help finance the Starship and Starlink projects.[79]
Construction of initial prototypes and tests for Starship started in early 2019 in Florida and Texas. All Starship construction and testing moved to the new SpaceX South Texas launch site later that year.
In May 2019, SpaceX also launched the first large batch of 60 Starlink satellites, beginning to deploy what would become the world's largest commercial satellite constellation the following year.[80]
The company raised $1.33 billion of capital across three funding rounds in 2019.[81]
By May 2019, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to $33.3 billion[82] and reached $36 billion by March 2020.[83] 
A significant milestone was achieved in May 2020, when SpaceX successfully launched two NASA astronauts (Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken) into orbit on a Crew Dragon spacecraft during Crew Dragon Demo-2, making SpaceX the first private company to send astronauts to the International Space Station and marking the first crewed orbital launch from American soil in 9 years.[84][85]
The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.[86] 
On 19 August 2020, after a $1.9 billion funding round, one of the largest single fundraising pushes by any privately held company, SpaceX's valuation increased to $46 billion.[87][88][89] 
In February 2021, SpaceX raised an additional $1.61 billion in an equity round from 99 investors[90] at a per share value of approximately $420,[89] raising the company valuation to approximately $74 billion. By 2021, SpaceX had raised more than $6 billion in equity financing. Most of the capital raised since 2019 has been used to support the operational fielding of the Starlink satellite constellation and the development and manufacture of the Starship launch vehicle.[90] By October 2021, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to $100.3 billion.[91] On 16 April 2021, Starship HLS won the contract, and will play a critical role in the Artemis program.[92] By 2021, SpaceX had entered into agreements with Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure to provide on-ground computer and networking services for Starlink.[93] A new round of financing in 2022 values SpaceX at $127 billion.[94] 
In July 2021, SpaceX unveiled another drone ship named A Shortfall of Gravitas, landing a booster from CRS-23 on it for the first time on 29 August 2021.[95] Within the first 130 days of 2022, SpaceX had 18 rocket launches and two astronaut splashdowns. Most 2022 SpaceX launches have focused on Starlink, a consumer internet business that sends batches of internet-beaming satellites and now has over 2,200 satellites in orbit.[96] On 13 December 2021, company CEO Elon Musk announced that the company was starting a carbon dioxide removal program that would convert captured carbon into rocket fuel,[97][98] after he announced a $100 million donation to the X Prize Foundation the previous February to provide the monetary rewards to winners in a contest to develop the best carbon capture technology.[99][100] 
On 16 July 2021 SpaceX entered an agreement to acquire Swarm Technologies, a private company building a low Earth orbit satellite constellation for communications with Internet of things (IoT) devices, for $524 million.[101][4] 
In August 2022, Reuters reported that the European Space Agency (ESA) began initial discussions with SpaceX that could lead to the company's launchers being used temporarily, given that Russia blocked access to Soyuz rockets amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[102] Since that same invasion and in the greater war between Russia and Ukraine, Starlink was extensively used.[103] 
In December 2022, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved to launch up to 7,500 of SpaceX's next-generation satellites in its Starlink internet network.[104] 
In 2022, SpaceX's Falcon 9 became the world record holder for the most launches of a single vehicle type in a single year.[105][106][non-primary source needed] SpaceX launched a rocket approximately every six days in 2022, with 61 launches in total. All but one (a Falcon Heavy in November) was on a Falcon 9 rocket.[105] 
On 20 April 2023, Starship's first orbital flight test ended in a mid-air explosion over the Gulf of Mexico before booster separation. After launch, multiple engines in the booster progressively failed, causing the vehicle to reach max q later than planned. Eventually, the vehicle lost control and spun erratically until the automated flight termination system was activated, which intentionally destroyed the rocket. Elon Musk, SpaceX, and other individuals familiar with the space industry have referred to the test flight as a success.[107][108] 
Musk said at the time that it would take between “six to eight weeks” to get the infrastructure prepared for another launch. In October 2023, a senior SpaceX executive stated the company had been ready to launch the next test flight since September. He accused government regulators of disrupting the project's progress, adding the delay could lead to China beating US astronauts back to the moon.[109][110] 
SpaceX has developed three launch vehicles. The small-lift Falcon 1 was the first launch vehicle developed and was retired in 2009. The medium-lift Falcon 9 and the heavy-lift Falcon Heavy are both operational. 
Falcon 1 was a small rocket capable of placing several hundred kilograms into low Earth orbit. It launched five times between 2006 and 2009, of which 2 were successful.[129] The Falcon 1 was the first privately funded, liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit.[111] 
Falcon 9 is a medium-lift launch vehicle capable of delivering up to 22,800 kilograms (50,265 lb) to orbit, competing with the Delta IV and the Atlas V rockets, as well as other launch providers around the world. It has nine Merlin engines in its first stage. The Falcon 9 v1.0 rocket successfully reached orbit on its first attempt on 4 June 2010. Its third flight, COTS Demo Flight 2, launched on 22 May 2012, and launched the first commercial spacecraft to reach and dock with the International Space Station (ISS).[49] The vehicle was upgraded to Falcon 9 v1.1 in 2013, Falcon 9 Full Thrust in 2015, and finally to Falcon 9 Block 5 in 2018. The first stage of Falcon 9 is designed to retropropulsively land, be recovered, and reflown.[130] 
Falcon Heavy is a heavy-lift launch vehicle capable of delivering up to 63,800 kg (140,700 lb) to Low Earth orbit (LEO) or 26,700 kg (58,900 lb) to geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). It uses three slightly modified Falcon 9 first stage cores with a total of 27 Merlin 1D engines.[131][132] The Falcon Heavy successfully flew its inaugural mission on 6 February 2018, launching Musk's personal Tesla Roadster into heliocentric orbit[133] 
Both the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are certified to conduct launches for the National Security Space Launch (NSSL).[134][135] As of 12 November 2023, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy have been launched 281 times, resulting in 279 full mission successes, one partial success, and one in-flight failure. In addition, a Falcon 9 experienced a pre-flight failure prior to a static fire test in 2016.[136][137] 
SpaceX is developing a fully reusable super-heavy lift launch system known as Starship. It comprises a reusable first stage, called Super Heavy, and the reusable Starship second stage space vehicle. The system is intended to supersede the company's existing launch vehicle hardware by the early 2020s.[138][139] 
Since the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company has developed several rocket engines – Merlin, Kestrel, and Raptor – for use in launch vehicles,[140][141] Draco for the reaction control system of the Dragon series of spacecraft,[142] and SuperDraco for abort capability in Crew Dragon.[143] 
Merlin is a family of rocket engines that uses liquid oxygen (LOX) and RP-1 propellants. Merlin was first used to power the Falcon 1's first stage and is now used on both stages of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles.[144]
Kestrel uses the same propellants and was used as the Falcon 1 rocket's second stage main engine.[141][145] 
Draco and SuperDraco are hypergolic liquid-propellant rocket engines. Draco engines are used on the reaction control system of the Dragon and Dragon 2 spacecraft.[142] The SuperDraco engine is more powerful, and eight SuperDraco engines provide launch escape capability for crewed Dragon 2 spacecraft during an abort scenario.[146] 
Raptor is a new family of liquid oxygen and liquid methane-fueled full-flow staged combustion cycle engines to power the first and second stages of the in-development Starship launch system.[140] Development versions were test-fired in late 2016,[147] and the engine flew for the first time in 2019, powering the Starhopper vehicle to an altitude of 20 m (66 ft).[148] 
SpaceX has developed the Dragon spacecraft to transport cargo and crew to the International Space Station. The first version of Dragon, used only for cargo, was first launched in 2010.[42] The currently operational second generation Dragon spacecraft, known as Dragon 2, conducted its first flight, without crew, to the ISS in early 2019, followed by a crewed flight of Dragon 2 in 2020.[84]
The cargo variant of Dragon 2 flew for the first time in December 2020, for a resupply to the Space Station as part of the CRS contract with NASA.[149] 
In March 2020 SpaceX revealed the Dragon XL, designed as a resupply spacecraft for NASA's planned Lunar Gateway space station under a Gateway Logistics Services (GLS) contract.[150] Dragon XL is planned to launch on the Falcon Heavy, and is able to transport over 5,000 kg (11,000 lb) to the Gateway. Dragon XL will be docked at the Gateway for six to twelve months at a time.[151] 
SpaceX routinely returns the first stage of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets after orbital launches. The rocket flights and land to a predetermined landing site using only its own propulsion systems.[152]
When propellant margins do not permit a return to launch site (RTLS), rockets return to floating landing platform in the ocean, called autonomous spaceport drone ships (ASDS).[153] 
SpaceX also plans to introduce floating launch platforms. These are modified oil rigs to use in the 2020s to provide a sea launch option for their second-generation launch vehicle: the heavy-lift Starship system, consisting of the Super Heavy booster and Starship second stage. SpaceX has purchased two deepwater oil rigs and are refitting them to support Starship launches.[154] 
Starlink is an internet satellite constellation under development by SpaceX that consists of thousands of cross-linked communications satellites in ~550 km orbits. Owned and operated by SpaceX, its goal is to address the significant unmet demand worldwide for low-cost broadband capabilities.[155] 
Development began in 2015, and initial prototype test-flight satellites were launched on the SpaceX Paz satellite mission in 2017. In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites aboard a Falcon 9.[156] Initial test operation of the constellation began in late 2020[157] and first orders were taken in early 2021.[158] Customers were told to expect internet service speeds of 50 Mbit/s to 150 Mbit/s and latency from 20 ms to 40 ms.[159] In December 2022, Starlink reached over 1 million subscribers worldwide.[160] 
The planned large number of Starlink satellites has been criticized by astronomers due to concerns over light pollution,[161][162][163] with the brightness of Starlink satellites in both optical and radio wavelengths interfering with scientific observations.[164] In response, SpaceX has implemented several upgrades to Starlink satellites aimed at reducing their brightness.[165] The large number of satellites employed by Starlink also creates long-term dangers of space debris collisions.[166][167] However, the satellites are equipped with krypton-fueled Hall thrusters which allow them to de-orbit at the end of their life. They are also designed to autonomously avoid collisions based on uplinked tracking data.[168] 
In December 2022, SpaceX announced Starshield, a program to incorporate military or government entity payloads on board a Starlink-derived satellite bus. The Space Development Agency is a key customer procuring satellites for a space-based missile defense system.[169][170] 
In June 2015, SpaceX announced that they would sponsor a Hyperloop competition, and would build a 1.6 km (0.99 mi) long subscale test track near SpaceX's headquarters for the competitive events.[171][172] The company has held the annual competition since 2017.[173] 
In collaboration with doctors and academic researchers, SpaceX invited all employees to participate in the creation of a COVID-19 antibody-testing program in 2020. As such, 4300 employees volunteered to provide blood-samples resulting in a peer-reviewed scientific paper crediting eight SpaceX employees as coauthors and suggesting that a certain level of COVID-19 antibodies may provide lasting protection against the virus.[174][175] 
In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children stuck in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[176] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, urged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a back-up, in case flooding worsened.[177][178] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[179][180] By this time, however, eight of the 12 children had already been rescued using full face masks and oxygen under anesthesia; consequently Thai authorities declined to use the submarine.[176] 
SpaceX is headquartered in Hawthorne, California, which also serves as its primary manufacturing plant.[181] The company operates a research and major operation in Redmond, Washington, owns a test site in Texas[182] and operates three launch sites, with another under development. SpaceX also operates regional offices in Texas, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.[73] SpaceX was incorporated in the state of Delaware.[183] 
SpaceX Headquarters is located in the Los Angeles suburb of Hawthorne, California. The large three-story facility, originally built by Northrop Corporation to build Boeing 747 fuselages,[181] houses SpaceX's office space, mission control, and Falcon 9 manufacturing facilities.[184] 
The area has one of the largest concentrations of space sector headquarters, facilities, and/or subsidiaries in the U.S., including Boeing/McDonnell Douglas main satellite building campuses, The Aerospace Corporation, Raytheon, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, United States Space Force's Space Systems Command at Los Angeles Air Force Base, Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, and AECOM, etc., with a large pool of aerospace engineers and recent college engineering graduates.[181] 
SpaceX uses a high degree of vertical integration in the production of its rockets and rocket engines.[13] SpaceX builds its rocket engines, rocket stages, spacecraft, principal avionics and all software in-house in their Hawthorne facility, which is unusual for the space industry.[13] 
In January 2015, SpaceX announced it would be entering the satellite production business and global satellite internet business. The first satellite facility is a 30,000 sq ft (2,800 m2) office building located in Redmond, Washington. As of January 2017, a second facility in Redmond was acquired with 40,625 sq ft (3,774.2 m2) and has become a research and development laboratory for the satellites.[185] In July 2016, SpaceX acquired an additional 8,000 sq ft (740 m2) office space in Irvine, California to focus on satellite communications.[186] 
SpaceX operates its Rocket Development and Test Facility in McGregor, Texas. All SpaceX rocket engines are tested on rocket test stands,[182] and low-altitude VTVL flight testing of the Falcon 9 Grasshopper in 2012–2013 were carried out at McGregor.[187] Testing of the much larger Starship prototypes is conducted at the SpaceX Starbase near Brownsville, Texas.[184] 
The company purchased the McGregor facilities from Beal Aerospace, where it refitted the largest test stand for Falcon 9 engine testing. SpaceX has made a number of improvements to the facility since its purchase and has also extended the acreage by purchasing several pieces of adjacent farmland. As of October 2012[update], the McGregor facility had seven test stands that are operated ""18 hours a day, six days a week""[188] and is building more test stands because production is ramping up and the company has a large manifest in the next several years.[189] In addition to routine testing, Dragon capsules (following recovery after an orbital mission), are shipped to McGregor for de-fueling, cleanup, and refurbishment for reuse in future missions.[190] 
SpaceX currently operates three orbital launch sites, at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Vandenberg Space Force Base, and Kennedy Space Center, with another under construction near Brownsville, Texas. SpaceX has indicated that they see a niche for each of the four orbital facilities and that they have sufficient launch business to fill each pad.[191] The Vandenberg launch site enables highly inclined orbits (66–145°), while Cape Canaveral and Kennedy enable orbits of medium inclination (28.5–51.6°).[192] 
Before it was retired, all Falcon 1 launches took place at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on Omelek Island of the Marshall Islands.[193] 
In April 2007, the Pentagon approved the use of Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) by SpaceX.[194] The site has been used since 2010 for Falcon 9 launches, mainly to low Earth and geostationary orbits. SLC-40 is not capable of supporting Falcon Heavy launches. The former Launch Complex 13 at Cape Canaveral, now renamed Landing Zones 1 and 2, has since 2015 been used for Falcon 9 first-stage booster landings.[195] 
Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 4 (SLC-4E) was leased from the military in 2011 and is used for payloads to polar orbits. The Vandenberg site can launch both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles,[196] but cannot launch to low inclination orbits. The neighboring SLC-4W was converted to Landing Zone 4 in 2015 for booster landings.[197] 
On 14 April 2014, SpaceX signed a 20-year lease for Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A.[198] The pad was subsequently modified to support Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches. SpaceX launched its first crewed mission to the ISS from Launch Pad 39A on 30 May 2020.[199] Pad 39A has been prepared since 2019 to eventually accommodate Starship launches. With delays in launch FAA permits for Boca Chica, the 39A Starship preparation was accelerated in 2022.[200] 
SpaceX manufactures and flies Starship test vehicles from the SpaceX Starbase in Boca Chica near Brownsville, Texas, having announced first plans for the launch facility in August 2014.[201][202] The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued the permit in July 2014.[203] SpaceX broke ground on the new launch facility in 2014 with construction ramping up in the latter half of 2015,[204] with the first suborbital launches from the facility in 2019.[184] Some residents of Boca Chica Village, Brownsville, and environmental activists criticized the site along with Starship development program in various aspects.[205][206] 
SpaceX won demonstration and actual supply contracts from NASA for the International Space Station (ISS) with technology the company developed. SpaceX is also certified for U.S. military launches of Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle-class (EELV) payloads. With approximately thirty missions on the manifest for 2018 alone, SpaceX represents over $12 billion under contract.[73] 
In 2006, SpaceX won a NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Phase 1 contract to demonstrate cargo delivery to the International Space Station (ISS), with a possible contract option for crew transport.[207] Through this contract, designed by NASA to provide ""seed money"" through Space Act Agreements for developing new capabilities, NASA paid SpaceX $396 million to develop the cargo configuration of the Dragon spacecraft, while SpaceX developed the Falcon 9 launch vehicle with their own resources.[208] These Space Act Agreements have been shown to have saved NASA millions of dollars in development costs, making rocket development 4–10 times cheaper than if produced by NASA alone.[209] 
In December 2010 the launch of the SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 1 mission, SpaceX became the first private company to successfully launch, orbit and recover a spacecraft.[210] Dragon successfully berthed with the ISS during SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 2 in May 2012, a first for a private spacecraft.[211] 
Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) are a series of contracts awarded by NASA from 2008 to 2016 for delivery of cargo and supplies to the International Space Station on commercially operated spacecraft. The first CRS contracts were signed in 2008 and awarded $1.6 billion to SpaceX for 12 cargo transport missions, covering deliveries to 2016.[212] SpaceX CRS-1, the first of the 12 planned resupply missions, launched in October 2012, achieved orbit, berthed and remained on station for 20 days, before re-entering the atmosphere and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.[213] 
CRS missions have flown approximately twice a year to the ISS since then. In 2015, NASA extended the Phase 1 contracts by ordering an additional three resupply flights from SpaceX, and then extended the contract further for a total of twenty cargo missions to the ISS.[214][212][215] The final Dragon 1 mission, SpaceX CRS-20, departed the ISS in April 2020, and Dragon was subsequently retired from service. A second phase of contracts was awarded in January 2016 with SpaceX as one of the awardees. SpaceX will fly up to nine additional CRS flights with the upgraded Dragon 2 spacecraft.[216][217] In March 2020, NASA contracted SpaceX to develop the Dragon XL spacecraft to send supplies to the Lunar Gateway space station. Dragon XL will be launched on a Falcon Heavy.[218] 
SpaceX is responsible for the transportation of NASA astronauts to and from the ISS. The NASA contracts started as part of the Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, aimed at developing commercially operated spacecraft capable of delivering astronauts to the ISS. The first contract was awarded to SpaceX in 2011,[219][220] followed by another in 2012 to continue development and testing of its Dragon 2 spacecraft.[221] 
In September 2014, NASA chose SpaceX and Boeing as the two companies that would be funded to develop systems to transport U.S. crews to and from the ISS.[222] SpaceX won $2.6 billion to complete and certify Dragon 2 by 2017. The contracts called for at least one crewed flight test with at least one NASA astronaut aboard. Once Crew Dragon received NASA human-spaceflight certification, the contract required SpaceX to conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station.[222] 
SpaceX completed the first key flight test of its Crew Dragon spacecraft, a Pad Abort Test, in May 2015,[223] and successfully conducted a full uncrewed test flight in early 2019. The capsule docked to the ISS and then splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean.[224] In January 2020, SpaceX conducted an in-flight abort test, the last test flight before flying crew, in which the Dragon spacecraft fired its launch escape engines in a simulated abort scenario.[225] 
On 30 May 2020, the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission was launched to the International Space Station with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, the first time a crewed vehicle had launched from the U.S. since 2011, and the first commercial crewed launch to the ISS.[226]
The Crew-1 mission was successfully launched to the International Space Station on 16 November 2020, with NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker along with JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi,[227] all members of the Expedition 64 crew.[228] On 23 April 2021, Crew-2 was launched to the International Space Station with NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and K. Megan McArthur, JAXA astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, and ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet.[229] The Crew-2 mission successfully docked on 24 April 2021.[230] 
SpaceX also offers paid crewed spaceflights for private individuals. The first of these missions, Inspiration4, launched in 2021 on behalf of Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman. The mission launched the Crew Dragon Resilience from the Florida Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A atop a Falcon 9 launch vehicle, placed the Dragon capsule into low Earth orbit, and ended successfully about three days later, when the Resilience splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean. All four crew members received commercial astronaut training from SpaceX. The training included lessons in orbital mechanics, operating in a microgravity environment, stress testing, emergency-preparedness training and mission simulations.[231] 
In 2005, SpaceX announced that it had been awarded an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, allowing the United States Air Force to purchase up to $100 million worth of launches from the company.[232] Three years later, NASA announced that it had awarded an IDIQ Launch Services contract to SpaceX for up to $1 billion, depending on the number of missions awarded.[233] In December 2012, SpaceX announced its first two launch contracts with the United States Department of Defense (DoD). The United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center awarded SpaceX two EELV-class missions: Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and Space Test Program 2 (STP-2). DSCOVR was launched on a Falcon 9 launch vehicle in 2015, while STP-2 was launched on a Falcon Heavy on 25 June 2019.[234] 
The Falcon 9 v1.1 was certified for National Security Space Launch (NSSL) in 2015, allowing SpaceX to contract launch services to the Air Force for any payloads classified under national security.[134]
This broke the monopoly held since 2006 by United Launch Alliance (ULA) over U.S. Air Force launches of classified payloads.[235]
In April 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded the first such national security launch to SpaceX to launch the second GPS III satellite for $82.7 million.[236] This was approximately 40% less than the estimated cost for similar previous missions.[237] SpaceX also launched the third GPS III launch on 20 June 2020.[238] In March 2018, SpaceX secured an additional $290 million contract from the U.S. Air Force to launch another three GPS III satellites.[239] 
The U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) also purchased launches from SpaceX, with the first taking place on 1 May 2017.[240] In February 2019, SpaceX secured a $297 million contract from the U.S. Air Force to launch another three national security missions, all slated to launch no earlier than FY 2021.[241] In August 2020, the U.S. Space Force awarded its National Security Space Launch (NSSL) contracts for the following 5–7 years. SpaceX won a contract for $316 million for one launch. In addition, SpaceX will handle 40% of the U.S. military's satellite launch requirements over the period.[242] 
SpaceX also designs and launches custom military satellites for the Space Development Agency as part of a new missile defense system in low Earth orbit.[243] The constellation would give the United States capabilities to sense, target and potentially intercept nuclear missiles and hypersonic weapons launched from anywhere on Earth.[244] Both China and Russia brought concerns to the United Nations about the program,[245] and various organizations warn it could be destabilizing and trigger an arms race in space.[246][247] 
SpaceX's low launch prices, especially for communications satellites flying to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), have resulted in market pressure on its competitors to lower their own prices.[13] Prior to 2013, the openly competed comsat launch market had been dominated by Arianespace (flying the Ariane 5) and International Launch Services (flying the Proton).[248] With a published price of $56.5 million per launch to low Earth orbit, Falcon 9 rockets were the cheapest in the industry.[249] European satellite operators are pushing the ESA to reduce launch prices of the Ariane 5 and the future Ariane 6 rockets as a result of competition from SpaceX.[250] 
SpaceX ended the United Launch Alliance (ULA) monopoly of U.S. military payloads when it began to compete for national security launches. In 2015, anticipating a slump in domestic, military, and spy launches, ULA stated that it would go out of business unless it won commercial satellite launch orders.[251] To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce to decrease launch costs by half.[252][253] 
Congressional testimony by SpaceX in 2017 suggested that the NASA Space Act Agreement process of ""setting only a high-level requirement for cargo transport to the space station [while] leaving the details to industry"" had allowed SpaceX to design and develop the Falcon 9 rocket on its own at a substantially lower cost. According to NASA's own independently verified numbers, SpaceX's total development cost for the Falcon 9 rocket, including the Falcon 1 rocket, was estimated at $390 million. In 2011, NASA estimated that it would have cost the agency about $4 billion to develop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster based upon NASA's traditional contracting processes, about ten times more.[209] In May 2020, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine remarked that thanks to NASA's investments into SpaceX, the United States has 70% of the commercial launch market, a major improvement since 2012 when there were no commercial launches from the country.[254] 
In November 2022, the company announced COO Gwynne Shotwell and vice president Mark Juncosa would oversee Starbase, its Texas launch facility, along with Omead Afshar, who at the time oversaw operations for Tesla in Texas. Shyamal Patel, who was senior director of operations at the site, would shift to its Cape Canaveral site. CNBC reported that these executive moves demonstrated ""the sense of urgency within the company to get Starship flying.""[267][268][269]   According to former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver, the company overall has a male-dominated employee culture,  similar to that of the spaceflight industry in general.[270] In December 2021, claims of workplace sexual harassment from five former SpaceX employees, ranging from interns to full engineers, were published.[271] The former employees claimed to have experienced unwanted advances and uncomfortable interactions.[272] Additionally, the accounts included claims of a culture of sexual harassment existing at the company and one where complaints made to executives, managers, and human resources officers went largely unaddressed.[273] 
In May 2022, a Business Insider article alleged that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct with a SpaceX flight attendant in a private jet in 2016 citing an anonymous friend of the flight attendant.[274] In response, some employees collaborated on an open letter condemning ""Elon's harmful Twitter behavior"".[275] It also asks the company to clearly define SpaceX's ""no-asshole"" and ""zero tolerance"" policies, which it says is unequally enforced from one employee to the next. The next day, Gwynne Shotwell announced that those employees who were involved with the letter had been terminated and claimed that unsponsored, unsolicited surveys were sent to employees during the work day, and that some felt pressured to sign the letter.[276] 
The company has also been described as having a work culture that pushes employees to work excessively, and was described as fostering a burnout culture.[277] According to a memo by Blue Origin, a rival aerospace company,[278][279][280] SpaceX expected very long work hours, work on weekends, and limited use of holidays.[277]

Billionaire Elon Musk tweeted, not for the first time, that “population collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming.” Climate change is a serious problem facing the planet and experts say it’s difficult to compare problems. 
   
      What is clear, demographers say, is that the global population is growing, despite declines in some parts of the world, and it shouldn’t be collapsing any time soon – even with birth rates at lower levels than in the past.
   
      “He’s better off making cars and engineering than at predicting the trajectory of the population,” said Joseph Chamie, a consulting demographer and a former director of the United Nations Population Division, who has written several books about population issues.
   
      “Yes, some countries, their population is declining, but for the world, that’s just not the case.”
   
      The world’s population is projected to reach 8 billion by mid-November of this year, according to the United Nations. The UN predicts the global population could grow to around 8.5 billion in just 8 years.
   
      By 2080, the world’s population is expected to peak at 10.4 billion. Then there’s a 50% chance that the population will plateau or begin to decrease by 2100. More conservative models like the one published in 2020 in the Lancet anticipate the global population would be about 8.8 billion people by 2100.
   
      It’s true that what’s driving current population growth is not a higher birth rate. What drives global population growth is that fewer people are dying young. Global life expectancy was 72.8 years in 2019, an increase of nine years since 1990. That is expected to increase to 77.2 years by 2050. 
   
It now costs more than $300,000 to raise a child, thanks to inflation        Globally, the fertility rate has not “collapsed,” nor should it, according to the UN, but it has dropped significantly.
   
      In 1950, women typically had five births each; globally, last year, it was 2.3 births. By 2050, the UN projects a further global decline to 2.1 births per woman. 
   
      In some countries, it is lower. In the US the 1950s, it was 3.6 births per woman, it slipped to 1.6 in 2020, according to the World Bank. In Italy, it was 1.2; in Japan, it was 1.3; in China, 1.2. In January 2022, the country announced the birth rate fell for the fifth year in a row, even with the repeal of the one child policy, allowing couples to have up to three children as of 2021. 
   
      “Virtually every developed country is below two, and it’s been that way for 20 or 30 years,” Chamie said. Most countries have gone through what’s called a demographic transition. 
   
Abortion laws impact people trying to become pregnant, too        The only continent that hasn’t finished this transition, he said, is parts of Africa, where there are 15 to 20 countries where the average number of children couples have is five. But in those countries, children still face high death rates. The infant mortality rate for kids under 5 is 8 to 10 times higher than in developed regions, and maternal mortality is more than double, Chamie said. 
   
      If women in these African regions had more access to contraception, education, and health care, these problems could be addressed and the global population could decline further – but people would be better off in terms of individual health.
   
      In terms of population growth, the 20th century was an anomaly.
   
      “That century was the most impressive demographic century ever. It had more gold medals than all the other centuries,” Charmie said. 
   
      The human population nearly quadrupled, something that had never happened before in recorded history. That’s largely because of improvements in public health.
   
Elon Musk reportedly had twins with a Neuralink executive        The world has antibiotics, vaccines, public health programs and improved sanitation to thank for people living longer and more mothers and children surviving birth.  
   
      With contraception, especially in 1964, when the oral pill was widely introduced in the US, couples were now better able to determine when and how many children they had. 
   
      “Contraception, the oral pill had a much more significant effect on the world than the car,” Charmie said.
   
As more women got an education, worked outside the home and got a later start on children in many countries with access to contraception, couples had fewer children and the population started to decline.
   
      In 2020, the global population growth rate fell under 1% for the first time since 1950.
   
      In the US, the fertility rate is down in part due to what Ken Johnson, a senior demographer at the Casey School of Public Poilcy and a professor of sociology at the University of New Hampshire, characterized as a “significant” decline in teen births.         “Most demographers would see that as a good thing,” he said. 
   
How outlawing abortion could worsen America's maternal mortality crisis        He said the other driver was a decline in the number of births to women in their 20s. That trend has been around since 2008. People put off or decided not to have babies in part because of the recession, he said. Covid then exacerbated this trend.  
   
      Between July of 2020 and 2021, the growth rate of the US population was the lowest it’s been in probably 100 years he said.
   
      “Is it a collapse of the number of births? No, I wouldn’t say that,” Johnson said. 
   
      He said there are a few factors at play in the low US growth rate: fewer births, fewer immigrants due to Trump-era policies, and more deaths as the US population is ages. Covid-19 contributed to higher deaths, too.
   
      “It’s almost like a perfect storm if you will,” Johnson said. “Births are way down, Covid pushes deaths way up, and then immigration is quite slow, too, so it is no wonder that the population growth rate is so low when you bring all those factors together at the same time.”
   
      As the population ages and birth rates decline in some areas of the globe, that could put strain on social systems.
   
      The share of the population over age 65 will rise from 10% in 2022 to 16% in 2050. That’s twice the number of kids under age 5. 
   
      Globally, the trick to make such a population age imbalance work, is that governments will need to be proactive, the UN says. Countries with aging populations need to adapt public programs that will support this growing population of older people. That means shoring up programs like social security, pensions and establishing universal access to health care and long-term care.
   
      In the US, William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow with Brookings Metro, said he doesn’t see the need for more couples to have more babies to address the age imbalance in the United States. Policies that would support couples that want children – affordable daycare and family leave policies, for example – could help, but that that hasn’t made a big difference in terms of fertility rates.

      Fertility is below the replacement rate in the US, meaning couples are having fewer than two children each, but the rate is not as low as it is in most of Europe, he said.
   
      “I don’t think in the US it’s an issue of collapse, because we can certainly open the faucet for more immigrants anytime we want to,” Frey said. “We’ll have no paucity of people who want to come through the door to immigrate here in the future. Immigrants and their children are younger than the population as a whole and so that will help to keep the population from aging as well.”

What we really need right now is not more cars, colonization dreams, and technokings, but a collective project to improve the lives of billions ...","Elon Musk is a singular visionary driving humanity toward a better future—or at least that’s what he and his admirers want us to believe. For the past two decades, supporters and news outlets have praised him for the bold narratives he’s woven around Tesla and SpaceX, and by extension allowed him to evade scrutiny and become the world’s richest man. Any time Musk sends a tweet, you can check his replies to see the devotion of his millions of followers. As his profile has been elevated by relentless media attention, Musk has become the figure everyone was looking for: a powerful man who sold the fantasy that faith in the combined power of technology and the market could change the world without needing a role for the government. (Just don’t talk about the billions in subsidies that kept his companies going over the years.)  But that collective admiration has only served to bolster an unaccountable and increasingly hostile billionaire. The holes in those future visions, and the dangers of applauding billionaire visionaries, have only become harder to ignore. As CEO of Tesla, Musk’s plan was to use luxury vehicles to fund a more affordable electric car. The Model 3 was supposed to be that vehicle, starting at $35,000. But the current starting price is $46,990, and most buyers end up paying even more. Teslas are supposed to be the model for “green” automobility, but the emissions required for the production of each individual vehicle are on the rise, and there are persistent problems with production quality which means they’re at risk of not lasting as long as vehicles from other carmakers. More importantly, those vehicles don’t have a clean, green supply chain. Around the world, mining companies are salivating at the opportunity presented by a shift to battery-powered vehicles because they’re so much more mineral-intensive than the ones we drive today. The International Energy Agency expects demand for battery minerals to soar by 2040, including up to 2,100 percent for cobalt and 4,200 percent for lithium. But that extraction comes with serious consequences for local environments and nearby communities. In 2019, Tesla was named in a lawsuit over the deaths of children in the Democratic Republic of Congo who died mining cobalt at sites owned by British mining company Glencore. Despite talking about cobalt-free batteries, Musk proceeded to sign a deal with Glencore in 2020 to supply its Berlin and Shanghai factories. The lawsuit was dismissed in November 2021, but in April of this year, an investigation from Global Witness found that Tesla was among a number of companies that may be getting minerals from mines using child workers in the DRC. It may be easy to overlook consequences that exist at the other end of Tesla’s supply chain, but these problems extend deep into the heart of its manufacturing operation. Black workers dubbed the company’s Fremont factory “the plantation” after being subject to racist abuse and a number of women described sexual harassment at the facility as “nightmarish.” Meanwhile, workers at the Nevada Gigafactory are suing after a mass firing of over 500 people, following reports that Musk praised workers in Tesla’s Shanghai factory for “burning the 3 am oil” by working 12-hour shifts and six-day weeks while sleeping on the factory floor. To top it off, Tesla’s customers are also being put in harm’s way. Its vehicles have slammed into highway medians, emergency vehicles, transport trucks, and more, while using its supposedly self-driving Autopilot feature. Musk continually misleads the public about how safe and capable the system really is, even as the U.S. traffic safety regulator is poised to recall hundreds of thousands of vehicles. And Tesla is just the tip of the iceberg. Elon Musk has wielded a virtual monopoly on how we think about the future, but will his visions really deliver better lives for most people in our society? For all the tech industry’s talk of “disruption,” keeping us all trapped in cars for decades into the future by equipping them with batteries or upgraded computers doesn’t feel like much of a revolution. A much more sustainable alternative to mass ownership of electric vehicles is to get people out of cars altogether—that entails making serious investments to create more reliable public transit networks, building out cycling infrastructure so people can safely ride a bike, and revitalizing the rail network after decades of underinvestment. But Musk has continually tried to stand in the way of such alternatives. He has a history of floating false solutions to the drawbacks of our over-reliance on cars that stifle efforts to give people other options. The Boring Company was supposed to solve traffic, not be the Las Vegas amusement ride it is now. As I’ve written in my book, Musk admitted to his biographer Ashlee Vance that Hyperloop was all about trying to get legislators to cancel plans for high-speed rail in California—even though he had no plans to build it. Several years ago, Musk said that public transit was “a pain in the ass” where you were surrounded by strangers, including possible serial killers, to justify his opposition. But the futures sold to us by Musk and many others in Silicon Valley didn’t just suit their personal preferences. They were designed to meet business needs, and were the cause of just as many problems as they claimed to solve—if not more. As Musk sets our collective sights on Mars, a town in south Texas and nearby wildlife reserve are being sacrificed on the altar of his personal ambition. SpaceX recently fired employees who wrote an open letter asking it to distance itself from its increasingly controversial CEO, while astronomers and Indigenous groups have expressed concern about what Starlink is doing to the night sky. Meanwhile, scientists will tell you living on Mars won’t be an easy task. In service of his dreams, Musk is purposefully obscuring those challenges. In crafting his future visions, Musk draws on the libertarian tendencies of Robert Heinlein and a technocratic longtermism inspired by Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, not to mention the dreams of Nazi-turned-NASA rocket engineer Wernher von Braun. Future visions cribbed from the pages of science fiction—often of the dystopian variety—and reshaped to fit the desires of the richest man in the world don’t serve the broader public. But there are other authors who provide very different answers to the questions of technology and the future. In 1985, Ursula K. Le Guin took aim at this “imperialistic kind” of science fiction that inspires Musk, in which “space and the future are synonymous: they are a place we are going to get to, invade, colonize, exploit, and suburbanize.” The renowned novelist explained that science fiction is not actually about the future; it’s about us and our thoughts and our dreams. But when we get confused about that, “we succumb to wishful thinking and escapism, and our science fiction gets megalomania and thinks that instead of being fiction it’s prediction.” That’s exactly where we find ourselves now: having our future dictated by powerful people who seek to recreate the space colonies or dystopian virtual reality worlds they read about as kids without considering the consequences. Kim Stanley Robinson, whose Mars trilogy helped inspire some of the recent interest in colonizing the red planet, has called Musk’s plan “the 1920s science-fiction cliché of the boy who builds a rocket to the moon in his backyard” and one that’s dangerously distracting us from the real problems we face here on Earth. For Le Guin, part of the problem is how we tell the human story: as one where a singular hero aggressively pushes it toward resolution, whether it’s the hunter with their bow or the Great Man driving society forward. It also infects our conception of technology, positioning it as “a heroic undertaking, Herculean, Promethean, conceived as triumph”—or as a call to “build”—rather than “the active human interface with the material world” and the more mundane technologies we rely on every day. Make no mistake: there is a need for people to think about the future and what a better one looks like, especially as we face serious challenges like the climate crisis. But we also need to question the idea of “progress” being sold to us and who it ultimately benefits. The tech industry enjoys casting itself as our savior, delivering empowerment and convenience, but along with it has come an unprecedented expansion of surveillance, an erosion of workers’ rights, and the empowerment of white nationalist and fascist groups. For years, Elon Musk sold us fantasies to distract from the reality of the future he’s trying to build, and to get people to accept his growing belligerence.

Tariffs are formal filings that utilities make with the Commission, tariffs cover everything from the rates a customer pays for water service each month to what qualifications a customer must meet in order to take service under a given rate offering.  Tariffs have the force and effect of contracts.  As contracts, tariffs can be viewed as setting out the legal obligations of both parties – the customer's and the utility's.  Tariffs are subject to review by the PSC, and in some instances, the courts. A utility must file its tariff with the PSC.  Tariffs on file with the PSC are available to the public for inspection on the PSC web site.  Once in effect, a utility must charge a customer the tariffed rate.  Per Wis. Stat. § 196.60, a utility cannot discriminate in the rates it charges customers.  Tariff revision requires a hearing if the new tariff would diminish the level of service received by a customer under an existing tariff or have the effect of increasing charges to a customer for an existing service.  A hearing is not required if the effect of the tariff would be to reduce rates, or if the utility is offering a new, optional tariffed service.  However, the revised tariff would still be subject to PSC staff review. The manner in which a water utility applies the service charge in Schedule BW-1 (i.e. per month, per day, per project, per tank load, etc.) is at the discretion of the utility.  However, once the utility determines the manner for doing so, it must be consistent in applying the​ charge.  Commission staff recommends that the utility include this policy in its policy manual or service rules. Provided they are included in the utility's current tariffs, two rates could apply:"
https://www.theverge.com/23026874/elon-musk-twitter-buyout-news-updates,Elon Musk vs. Twitter: all the news about one of the biggest ...,20220801,"Elon Musk made a deal to buy Twitter and then decided he wanted out. After a summer detour to Chancery Court in Delaware, Musk has closed the acquisition ...","By  Andrew J. Hawkins and  David Pierce On Thursday, April 14th, Elon Musk announced an offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share. On April 25th, Twitter accepted the deal. By July 8th, Musk wanted out. Now, as of October 27th, the new owner of Twitter is Elon Musk. This is a huge story with a lot of fast-moving parts to it. It’s also a story that will likely stretch out over the next few months, maybe even longer. So we thought we’d put together a guide for you, our readers, that can be updated as things continue to unfold. Because, like Elon, we ❤️ you. So strap in. It’s going to be a bumpy ride.  The latest news: There hasn’t been an official announcement yet, and Musk’s only tweet since the news broke was about a SpaceX launch, but the deal for Elon Musk to buy Twitter is complete. Word of Musk’s takeover came down late Thursday evening, along with reports he immediately fired several of the company’s executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, policy chief Vijaya Gadde, general counsel Sean Edgett, and chief customer officer Sarah Personette. The rest of the story so far: On October 4th, Bloomberg reported that Musk sent another offer letter to buy Twitter at the original price: $54.20 a share. That would mean, essentially, that after all this, and without going to trial, Musk is willing to just give up and go ahead with the acquisition. The timing of the new offer is strange, as is the fact that Musk didn’t offer some big-but-not-as-big number to try and settle the deal once and for all. It did come just before Musk was scheduled to be deposed, though, and just after a slew of embarrassing texts between Musk and his billionaire friends came out. Twitter’s share price immediately spiked on the news, and ultimately, the judge paused the proceedings, giving Twitter and Elon Musk until 5PM ET on October 28th to work out a deal based on their original agreement. Jack Dorsey, Joe Rogan, Larry Ellison, Jason Calacanis — Musk texted with a huge number of people about the Twitter deal, and the release of many of those texts gave us some insight into how the deal came together and fell apart. Things got particularly messy, it appears, when current Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal asked Musk to stop tweeting damaging things about the company. That’s when Musk immediately decided not to join the board and launched his plan to take it private. Dorsey loved the idea; Calacanis had a lot of weird ideas about it; everybody was falling over themselves to give Musk money to make it happen. The texts are weird and hilarious and very much worth a read. Musk’s lawyers have now sent three letters to Twitter attempting to terminate his agreement to buy the company. This time, they cited Twitter’s multimillion-dollar severance payment to Zatko, saying it was a violation of the merger agreement and a reason to end the deal. A few days later, Twitter responded the way it always does: your argument is invalid, Twitter hasn’t breached its side of the deal, and so you can’t either. In early September, Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick said that Musk’s side can include Zatko’s claims in its case but denied yet another effort to delay the trial. “I am convinced that even four weeks’ delay would risk further harm to Twitter too great to justify,” McCormick said. And as we continue to learn more about the brain drain happening at Twitter, it seems she might be right.  Musk and his team tried to use Zatko’s revelations about Twitter this as a chance to maybe, actually get out of the deal. His lawyers filed a new “Termination Letter” with the SEC on August 29th, which cites Zatko’s testimony as evidence that Twitter misled Musk in the parties’ merger agreement. Specifically, Musk claims that Twitter’s declaration in the merger agreement that it had not misled the SEC is false. Twitter responded saying basically, nope, we haven’t breached any of our agreement. Peter “Mudge” Zatko was fired in early 2022 from his position as Twitter’s head of security. In July, he filed a whistleblower report saying Twitter has hidden negligent security practices, misled federal regulators about its safety, and failed to properly estimate the number of bots on its platform. Zatko is a long-tenured and well-respected voice in the hacker and security community, and his allegations are sure to have a huge impact in and out of Twitter. Congress, for one, has already said it is investigating Zatko’s claims. Zatko’s disclosure says directly that Twitter lied to Musk about its spam and bot measurements, which could be fodder for Musk’s complaints about spambots, though Zatko’s support for those particular allegations feels fairly thin. Twitter denied all the accusations, calling them “a false narrative.” The subpoenas ahead of the trial have become a who’s who of the tech industry, including Dorsey, Larry Ellison, Marc Andreessen, Tesla, Keith Rabois, and many others. Dorsey was a surprise but seems likely to have plenty of pertinent information, given both his tenure as Twitter CEO and the fact that Dorsey reportedly pushed hard to convince Musk to buy the company in the first place. The financing structure of Musk’s Twitter acquisition has shifted over time, but even after promising in April that “no further TSLA sales planned after today,” Musk sold another huge batch of his shares. “In the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close *and* some equity partners don’t come through,” he tweeted soon after, “it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock.” Musk’s side wanted more time and for the trial to start in February 2023. Twitter wanted it to start as soon as possible. Chancellor McCormick, who will oversee the trial, said the trial will start on October 17th and will last five days. Of course, that assumes the two sides don’t settle, and that remains anyone’s guess. Twitter appears to be already feeling the Musk Effect: when it reported earnings in July, the company said its revenue fell for a variety of macroeconomic reasons but also because of what it described as “uncertainty related to the pending acquisition of Twitter by an affiliate of Elon Musk.” One thing Twitter won’t give Musk credit for? Its user growth. The service reported reaching more than 237 million daily users, up from 229 million last quarter. That, of course, was due to “ongoing product improvements.” We wouldn’t normally tell you it’s worth reading a 162-page legal filing that gets deep into the weeds of bot measurement procedures. But this case has been filled with abnormally spicy legal fighting, much of which was clearly written to be read by a wide audience. It’s a good yarn. Almost as soon as Musk made clear his intentions to get out of buying Twitter, Twitter filed a lawsuit that said, in effect: you agreed to pay $44 billion for Twitter, and we intend to get all $44 billion for our shareholders. Twitter filed its suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery, which immediately became the most exciting judicial system nobody had ever heard of. It paints a picture of Musk going out of his way to make an unexpected and unusually generous offer to Twitter, only to almost immediately turn around and start toying with the company and the idea of abandoning their agreement. It looked like it was going to happen, and then it did: only weeks after announcing his intention to buy Twitter, Musk tried to get out of it. Musk’s team claimed he was terminating the deal because Twitter was in “material breach” of their agreement and had made “false and misleading” statements during negotiations. In particular, Musk was concerned about the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter and what he saw as Twitter’s reluctance to prove its own research on the subject. Musk joined a virtual town hall with Twitter employees and attempted to answer their questions about the future of the company and platform. He offered vague answers about wanting to emulate WeChat and learn from TikTok and letting people work from home more often while saying Twitter would attract 1 billion users. Meanwhile, he hinted that significant layoffs could be in the company’s future. After a number of cagey tweets and “just asking questions” sorts of moves, Musk’s legal team made its first official threat to back out of the acquisition. In a legal filing, they claimed that Twitter failed to provide Musk with information on the service’s spam bot problem and that he’s entitled to receive that information under the deal agreement. Twitter, they wrote, was actively preventing him from getting the information he needed.  “My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate,” Musk tweeted, referencing Twitter’s oft-cited number that less than 5 percent of the accounts on the platform were fake or spam. “Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%. This deal cannot move forward until he does.” Musk’s frustration appeared to be totally beside the point and the sort of thing he should have raised before signing a binding agreement to buy the company. But it was clear that if Musk decided he did want out, this would be his way. The turmoil inside Twitter wasn’t just coming from Musk and his legal team. Parag Agrawal, the still-new CEO of the company, fired some of his top executives, including consumer product leader Kayvon Beykpour and Bruce Falck, the general manager of revenue and head of product for its business side. “The priorities and decisions we make now will not only bolster how we navigate through this time,” Agrawal said in a memo to Twitter’s staff, “but also for the longer-term success of Twitter which I care about deeply.” One other big Twitter-under-Musk question is what he’ll do about the platform’s permanent ban on Donald Trump. Musk said during a Financial Times conference that he’d undo it. “I guess the answer is I would reverse the permaban,” he said, “obviously I don’t own Twitter yet, so it’s not a thing that will definitely happen because what if I don’t own Twitter?” Could Twitter Blue be the future of Twitter? Musk thinks so. He believes he can turn Twitter subscriptions into a $10 billion business by 2028, which would be double the entire company’s current revenue. Of course, that also includes huge user growth: Musk estimated Twitter could have 600 million users in 2025 and 931 million in 2028. That’s a big jump from the company’s current crop of 217 million users. On April 25th, Twitter’s board of directors accepted Musk’s offer of $54.20 per share, or $44 billion, for total control of the company. It was the same price he named in his initial offer on April 14th. Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a private company. Musk began working to line up financing for the deal and sold 9.6 million of his Tesla shares to free up about $8.4 billion. Hours after announcing his bid to buy Twitter, Musk was on stage in Vancouver for a well-timed interview with TED Talk founder Chris Anderson. During the conversation, Musk spoke about his “obsession with the truth” and echoed comments he made in his SEC filing about wanting to protect free speech and democracy. Musk may be in for a rude awakening if he is able to buy Twitter But as Adi Robertson pointed out, his understanding of free speech appears to be nebulous at best. After examining Musk’s comments, as well as previous efforts by Twitter’s leadership to contend with speech laws around the world, she concluded that Musk may be in for a rude awakening if he succeeds in buying the social media platform.  Twitter’s first all-hands meeting after Musk’s bid went public was a weird one. After serenading employees with Backstreet Boys and Aretha Franklin, the company said it would continue to evaluate the offer. Employees told The Verge’s Alex Heath they were frustrated by the lack of a more detailed response. They’re concerned about the future of the social media platform, as well as the possibility of layoffs. Musk is a very rich guy. So, naturally, he would say that he isn’t interested in buying Twitter to make money. He views Twitter as the “de facto town square” and wants to open source the social media company’s algorithm. He tried to frame the whole takeover bid as some sort of crusade to protect free speech.  But even a free speech maximalist like Musk needs to convince shareholders that his buyout offer is in their financial self-interest. Otherwise, what are we really doing here? Anyone who’s been in the market to buy a house knows about “best and final” offers. In his opening salvo, Musk claimed his bid to buy Twitter was exactly that. He was offering Twitter’s shareholders a pretty fair premium: $43 billion for a company with a $37 billion market cap.  Musk said that Twitter must go private in order to undergo the changes that need to be made. These included an edit feature, an open-source algorithm, less moderation, and a higher bar for removing offending tweets.  After news broke that Musk had acquired 9.1 percent of the company’s shares, many people briefly entertained the notion that Musk might try to buy the whole company, only to eventually conclude he had already gotten everything he wanted out of Twitter.  Casey was right in positing that Twitter’s poison pill provisions may not be enough to stop Musk. But he also assumed that Musk would just continue to troll the company through his tweets.  After declining a seat on Twitter’s board, Musk updated his filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to indicate that he would not be a passive player in the company’s affairs. Gone was the language that he would restrict his holdings to just 14.0 percent of the company. In retrospect, this was the first clue that he may attempt something more impactful than just buying some stock of serving as a board member.  A thousand years ago, on April 4th, 2022, Elon Musk announced that he had purchased 9.1 percent of Twitter. The news that the world’s richest man was now (briefly) the largest shareholder in his preferred social media platform sent the stock price soaring and many a keyboard a-typing.  Musk immediately set about soliciting suggestions about ways to improve Twitter by — what else — tweeting a poll. The company responded by offering him a board seat, a move that would have restricted him to owning just 15 percent of the company. At first, he said yes. Then he changed his mind and said no. Meanwhile, our resident Twitter and Musk experts, Casey Newton and Liz Lopatto, respectively, dug deeper into why Musk was flirting with Twitter and what the likely outcomes would be.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

Musk's Texas company now is floating ambitious plans to deploy thousands of humanoid robots, known as Tesla Bot or Optimus, within its factories ...","SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk blamed overreliance on factory robots for sending the electric carmaker to ""production hell"" four years ago, saying humans were better at certain jobs. My, how times have changed. Musk's Texas company now is floating ambitious plans to deploy thousands of humanoid robots, known as Tesla Bot or Optimus, within its factories, expanding eventually to millions around the world, according to job postings. Buzz is building within the company as Tesla is having more internal meetings on robots, a person familiar with the matter said. Longer term, Musk said at a TED Talk robots could be used in homes, making dinner, mowing the lawn and caring for the elderly people, and even becoming a ""buddy"" or a ""catgirl"" sex partner. The robot business eventually may be worth more than Tesla's car revenue, according to Musk, who is now touting a vision for the company that goes well beyond making self-driving electric vehicles. At its ""AI Day"" on Sept. 30, Tesla will unveil a prototype from its project Optimus, an allusion to the powerful and benevolent leader of the Autobots in the Transformers series. Production could start next year, Musk said. Tesla faces skepticism that it can show technological advances that would justify the expense of ""general purpose"" robots in factories, homes and elsewhere, according to robotics experts, investors and analysts interviewed by Reuters. Tesla already employs hundreds of robots designed for specific jobs for production of its cars. Humanoid robots have been in development for decades by Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS)'s Boston Dynamics unit. Like self-driving cars, the robots have trouble with unpredictable situations.  read more  ""Self-driving cars weren't really proved to be as easy as anyone thought. And it's the same way with humanoid robots to some extent,"" the lead of NASA's Dexterous Robotics Team, Shaun Azimi, told Reuters. ""If something unexpected happens, being flexible and robust to those kinds of changes is very difficult."" At an ""Autonomy"" event in 2019, Musk promised 1 million robotaxis by 2020 but has yet to deliver such a car. Musk's robots may be able to demonstrate basic capabilities at the event, but it would be hard for them to impress public expectations of robots that are as capable as humans, experts say. To succeed, Tesla will need to show robots doing multiple, unscripted actions, said Nancy Cooke, a professor in human systems engineering at Arizona State University. Such proof could provide a boost to Tesla stock, which is down 25% from its 2021 peak. ""If he just gets the robot to walk around, or he gets the robots to dance, that's already been done. That's not that impressive,"" she said. Tesla did not respond to Reuters' request for comments, but Musk in the past proved skeptics wrong, jump-starting the electric car market and building a rocket company, SpaceX, although some product launches were behind schedule. [1/8]A humanoid robot developed by Tesla, known as Tesla Bot or Optimus, is shown in a frame grab from the live video of Tesla's AI Day streamed on August 20, 2022. Tesla/Handout via REUTERS  Acquire Licensing Rights Initially, Optimus will perform boring or dangerous jobs, including moving parts around its factories, according to Musk. Musk acknowledged that humanoid robots do not have enough intelligence to navigate the real world without being explicitly instructed. But he said Tesla can leverage its expertise in AI and key components to develop and produce smart, yet less expensive, humanoid robots at scale. He tweeted on Monday that its Autopilot team is also working on its Optimus robot, when asked about fixes of what it calls Full Self-Driving beta - a test version of its new automated driving software. Tesla is on hiring spree for people to work on humanoid bi-pedal robots, with about 20 job postings on ""Tesla Bot"" including jobs for designing key robot parts like ""actuators"". ""The code you will write will at term run in millions of humanoid robots across the world, and will therefore be held to high quality standards,"" one of the job postings said. Tesla has over 2 million vehicles on the road. Jonathan Hurst, chief technology officer at Agility Robotics, a humanoid robot firm founded in 2015 said the technology ""is right now starting to turn the corner."" ""Certainly, an important measure of success is do they make money from it,"" he told Reuters, referring to Tesla's humanoid robot efforts. Analysts see more pageant than product. ""It's all part of distracting people and giving them the next shiny object to chase after,"" Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid said. ""Investors are not excited about Optimus,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, which holds Tesla stocks. ""It's just such a low probability that it works at scale,"" he said, saying it is ""infinitely harder than self-driving cars."" And then there is Musk's own experience with robots in the factory. During the 2018 production hell, Musk specifically noted the problems of the ""fluff bot,"" an assembly robot that failed to perform simple tasks that human hands can do - picking up pieces of ""fluff"" and placing them on batteries. He said the cost of having technicians maintain the complicated robot far exceeded that of hiring someone to do the assembly. The fluff bot is ""a funny example but drives home the point that autonomy often doesn't generalize well, and so handling soft fluffy material that isn't as predictable as a rigid part was causing a huge problem,"" Aaron Johnson, a mechanical engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said. ""Human hands are way better at doing that,"" Musk said. Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Peter Henderson, Ben Klayman and Lisa Shumaker Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

But Mr Musk said he wanted to solve one of the toughest problems artificial intelligence: how to make a machine that can replace a human. The entrepreneur, who once warned of artificial intelligence being a threat to humanity, said that Tesla wanted to make sure the transition to a society in which robots did the work and people reaped the benefits was a safe one. ""We always want to be careful we don't go down the Terminator path,"" he cautioned, referring to a blockbuster film about a killer cyborg. He added that Tesla was building in safeguards, including a stop button that could not be be tampered with. Mr Musk contended that shareholders would determine if the publicly traded company was socially responsible. Tesla's AI Day is aimed at recruiting and showcasing latest products.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The $258 billion racketeering lawsuit accusing Elon Musk of running a pyramid scheme to support the cryptocurrency Dogecoin has expanded, adding seven new investor plaintiffs and six new defendants including his tunnel construction business Boring Co. According to an amended complaint filed on Tuesday night in Manhattan federal court, Musk, his electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), his space tourism company SpaceX, Boring and others intentionally drove up the price of Dogecoin more than 36,000% over two years and then let it crash. By doing so, the defendants ""profited tens of billions of dollars"" at other Dogecoin investors' expense, while knowing all along that the currency lacked intrinsic value and that its value ""depended solely on marketing,"" the complaint said. Tesla, SpaceX and Boring did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment. Tesla disbanded its media relations department in 2020. The original lawsuit was filed in June.  read more  Shortly afterward, Musk, the world's richest person, tweeted that he would ""keep supporting Dogecoin,"" and in an interview said ""people that work around the factory at SpaceX or Tesla"" asked him for that support, the amended complaint said. Other new defendants include the Dogecoin Foundation, which calls itself a nonprofit providing governance and support for Dogecoin. It could not immediately be reached for comment. The $258 billion in damages is triple the estimated decline in Dogecoin's market value since May 2021. That was around the time Musk, playing a fictitious financial expert on a ""Weekend Update"" segment of NBC's ""Saturday Night Live,"" called Dogecoin ""a hustle."" Dogecoin traded at about 6 cents on Wednesday, down from around 74 cents in May 2021. The case is Johnson et al v. Musk et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-05037.

The texts are juicy, but not because they are lurid, particularly offensive, or offer up some scandalous Muskian master plan—quite the opposite.","The world’s richest man has some embarrassing friends. Sign up for Charlie’s newsletter, Galaxy Brain, here. Yesterday, the world got a look inside Elon Musk’s phone. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO is currently in litigation with Twitter and trying to back out of his deal to buy the platform and take it private. As part of the discovery process related to this lawsuit, Delaware’s Court of Chancery released hundreds of text messages and emails sent to and from Musk. The 151-page redacted document is a remarkable, voyeuristic record of a few months in the life of the world’s richest (and most overexposed) man and a rare unvarnished glimpse into the overlapping worlds of Silicon Valley, media, and politics. The texts are juicy, but not because they are lurid, particularly offensive, or offer up some scandalous Muskian master plan—quite the opposite. What is so illuminating about the Musk messages is just how unimpressive, unimaginative, and sycophantic the powerful men in Musk’s contacts appear to be. Whoever said there are no bad ideas in brainstorming never had access to Elon Musk’s phone. In no time, the texts were the central subject of discussion among tech workers and watchers. “The dominant reaction from all the threads I’m in is Everyone looks fucking dumb,” one former social-media executive, whom I’ve granted anonymity because they have relationships with many of the people in Musk’s texts, told me. “It’s been a general Is this really how business is done? There’s no real strategic thought or analysis. It’s just emotional and done without any real care for consequence.” Appearing in the document is, I suppose, a perverse kind of status symbol (some people I spoke with in tech and media circles copped to searching through it for their own names). And what is immediately apparent upon reading the messages is that many of the same people the media couldn’t stop talking about this year were also the ones inserting themselves into Musk’s texts. There’s Joe Rogan; William MacAskill, the effective altruist, getting in touch on behalf of the crypto billionaire and Democratic donor Sam Bankman-Fried; Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Axel Springer (and the subject of a recent, unflattering profile); Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist, NIMBY, and prolific blocker on Twitter; Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, who was recently revealed to have joined a November 2020 call about contesting Donald Trump’s election loss; and, of course, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder and former CEO. Musk, arguably the most covered and exhausting of them all, has an inbox that doubles as a power ranking of semi- to fully polarizing people who have been in the news the past year. Few of the men in Musk’s phone consider themselves his equal. Many of the messages come off as fawning, although they’re possibly more opportunistic than earnest. Whatever the case, the intentions are unmistakable: Musk is perceived to have power, and these pillars of the tech industry want to be close to it. “I love your ‘Twitter algorithms should be open source’ tweet,” Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of Palantir, said, before suggesting that he was going to mention the idea to members of Congress at an upcoming GOP policy retreat. Antonio Gracias, the CEO of Valor Partners, cheered on the same tweet, telling the billionaire, “I am 100% with you Elon. To the mattresses no matter what.” Read: Elon Musk, baloney king Few in Musk’s phone appeared as excitable as the angel investor Jason Calacanis, who peppered his friend with flattery and random ideas for the service. In the span of 30 minutes, not long after Musk’s bid to take the company private, Calacanis suggested a five-point plan for Twitter that would introduce a membership tier, creator revenue splits, algorithmic transparency, and changes to the company’s operations—including but not limited to moving the company from San Francisco to Austin. After pledging his loyalty (“You have my sword,” he texted Musk), Calacanis pushed new ideas for weeks. “Just had the best idea ever for monetization,” he wrote out of the blue, before suggesting a way that users could pay Twitter in order to spam their followers with promotional DMs. “Imagine we ask Justin Beaver to come back and let him DM his fans … he could sell 1m in merchandise or tickets instantly. Would be INSANE,” he wrote, apparently adding an unfortunate instance of autocorrect to the historical record. According to the court document, Musk didn’t respond. Later on, Musk chastised Calacanis for trying to whip up public investments to finance Musk’s acquisition. This leads to a string of messages that read straight out of Succession: Musk: Morgan Stanley and Jared think you are using our friendship not in a good way This makes it seem like I’m desperate. Please stop. Calacanis:  Only ever want to support you. During Musk’s April media frenzy, the billionaire frequently demonstrated a shallow understanding of Twitter, suggesting contradictory policies such as banning spam and bot armies but also leaving up all content that is “legal.” (Spam, bot armies, and crypto scam hawkers are all technically legal.) Many of the ideas coming from his peanut gallery were equally poor. Döpfner, who is in charge of numerous media companies, including Insider and Politico, offered to run Twitter for Musk but seemed woefully unprepared for the task. In a novel-length text, Döpfner laid out his “#Gameplan” for the company, which started with the line item: “1.),, Solve Free Speech.” He alluded to vague ideas such as making Twitter censorship resistant via a “decentralized infrastructure” and “open APIs.” He’s similarly nonspecific with his suggestion that Twitter have a “marketplace” of algorithms. “If you’re a snowflake and don’t want content that offends you pick another algorithm,” he wrote Musk. At one point in early April, Musk appears infatuated with his own idea to replace Twitter with a blockchain-based payment-and-message system. In a string of texts to his brother, the entrepreneur Kimbal Musk, he manages to convince himself that the idea could be huge and a way to crush spam while preserving free speech. In this preposterous scenario, users would have to pay a fractional amount of the cryptocurrency Dogecoin to post or retweet. Roughly 10 days later, Musk sends a different text noting that “blockchain Twitter isn’t possible.” Read: Elon Musk already showed us how he’ll run Twitter The texts also cast a harsh light on the investment tactics of Silicon Valley’s best and brightest. There’s Calacanis’s overeager angel-investing pitches, and then you have the more chill tactics of people like Andreessen, who in a tossed-off Twitter DM offered Musk “$250M with no additional work required.” “Thanks!” Musk responded. In a separate exchange, Musk asks Ellison if he’d like to invest in taking Twitter private. “Yes, of course,” Ellison replies. “A billion … or whatever you recommend.” Easy enough. “This is one of the most telling things I’ve ever seen about how investing works in Silicon Valley,” Jessica Lessin, the founder of the tech publication The Information, tweeted of the Andreessen exchange. Indeed, both examples from the document offer a look at the boys’ club and power networks of the tech world in action. Is it surprising that rich people (including one of the world’s 10 richest men) are throwing money at their friends the way you might on a low-stakes poker night? Not really—and especially not when that man is the richest man in the world. But the eagerness to pony up for Musk and the lazy quality of this dealmaking reveal something deeper about the brokenness of this investment ecosystem and the ways that it is driven more by vibes and grievances than due diligence. Looking at these texts, it seems much easier to understand Andreessen Horowitz’s recent $350 million investment in WeWork founder Adam Neumann’s new real-estate start-up, or Bankman-Fried’s admission that most venture-capitalist investments are not “the paragon of efficient markets” and driven primarily by FOMO and hype. “Like, all the models are made up, right?” he infamously told Bloomberg last April. What’s immediately clear is that many of the men in Musk’s phone are having fun with his Twitter escapade. It is an opportunity to blithely throw shit at the wall and see what sticks. They toss out phrases like “hard reboot” and “Day Zero. Sharpen your blades boys”—to cleave through what they see as an unnecessary and ineffective workforce, perhaps. They imagine massive revenue opportunities and sweeping changes that only they can usher in. For this crew, the early success of their past companies or careers is usually prologue, and their skills will, of course, transfer to any area they choose to conquer (including magically solving free speech). But what they are actually doing is winging it. “I’m on 20 threads with people,” the former social-media executive told me. “And it’s literally like, Damn, they were just throwing shit at the wall. The ideas people were writing in, in terms of who would be CEO—it’s some real fantasy-baseball bullshit.” Despite all the self-mythologizing and talk of building, the men in these text messages appear mercurial, disorganized, and incapable of solving the kind of societal problems they think they can. There is a tendency, especially when it comes to the über-rich and powerful, to assume and to fantasize about what we can’t see. We ascribe shadowy brilliance or malevolence, which may very well be unearned or misguided. What’s striking about the Musk messages, then, is the similarity between these men’s behavior behind closed doors and in public on Twitter. Perhaps the real revelation here is that the shallowness you see is the shallowness you get."

A California Tesla owner is suing Tesla Inc. in a proposed class action in federal court, saying the company's CEO Elon Musk has been ...","A California Tesla owner is suing Tesla Inc. in a proposed class action in federal court, saying the company's CEO Elon Musk has been promising full self-driving ""in a year"" since 2016, but is still not ""remotely close"" to reaching that goal. In the complaint, filed Wednesday, named plaintiff Briggs A. Matsko alleges that the company has privately admitted to regulators that its technology is nowhere near the lofty promises Musk has made, and that the company has effectively been using its buyers as untrained testers while steadily increasing the price of the ""Autopilot"" feature even as drivers are injured and killed in accidents involving the technology. Matsko said that he bought a 2018 Model X new and paid $5,000 over the listed price for the ""Enhanced Autopilot"" version of the company's advanced driver assistance systems, or ADAS, technology, while the company and its CEO promised self-driving tech would rapidly advance. ""It is now four years later, and Tesla has never provided Plaintiff anything remotely approaching the fully self-driving car it promised to provide,"" Matsko wrote. The complaint cites the six-point scale published by SAE International, previously known as the Society of Automotive Engineers, which has become an international standard for describing the capabilities of self-driving cars, with 0 on the scale meaning no automation and 5 being full automation without any input necessary from drivers. While Musk has promised to reach 5 on that scale for years — often telling investors or the media that Tesla would reach that point within the calendar year or within a year — Matsko said in the complaint that the company's engineers and attorneys have admitted to regulators that at best, Tesla is at a 2 on the scale, meaning that drivers must still actively drive the vehicles, and are nowhere near the benchmarks for progressing to 3. In the meantime, Matsko wrote that Tesla has been increasing the add-on price for its autopilot features, with the company announcing that starting in September it would cost $15,000, and drivers are being injured or killed in accidents that involve the autopilot feature. The complaint further alleges that since 2016, Tesla has used a promotional video of one of its vehicles supposedly on autopilot with someone in the driver's seat ""for legal reasons"" who is ""not doing anything,"" despite engineers who had worked on the video later confessing that the vehicle had many problems, including a collision that required repairs, in the filming of that video. Matsko also cites a number of real-world accidents involving Tesla vehicles, including a 2018 crash in which the software allegedly steered the vehicle directly into a concrete barrier on a California highway, and other incidents of the vehicles hitting stationary obstacles like an overturned tractor-trailer. Following a crash in China, Tesla removed ""self-driving"" language from its Chinese website, according to the complaint, but has not removed that language from its English-language materials. The complaint also notes that regulators like the California Department of Motor Vehicles have also taken aim at Tesla, with the state filing suit against Tesla in July 2022 for misleading and deceptive marketing, and the DMV is seeking to revoke Tesla's California license to manufacture and sell its vehicles. In addition, Tesla has been the target of both a federal investigation and a class action over ""phantom braking"" in its vehicles, with allegations that they come to a stop for seemingly no reason. In the suit, Matsko aims to represent either a nationwide class or a California class of everyone who bought or leased from Tesla one of its vehicles with an ""Autopilot,"" ""Enhanced Autopilot,"" or ""Full Self-Driving Capability"" feature from January 2016 to now, and brings causes of action for violations of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, breach of express and implied warranty, false advertising, unfair competition, fraud and unjust enrichment, among others. Matsko is asking the court to block Tesla from continuing its deceptive practices, as well as seeking compensatory and punitive damages, including restitution and disgorgement of its profits from selling the vehicles. ""As alleged in the complaint, people have relied upon the representations of Tesla that the self-driving capabilities are completely safe, when Tesla knew they had many problems,"" Joseph W. Cotchett of Cotchett Pitre & McCarthy LLP, representing Matsko, said in a press release Thursday.

Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 ...","We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. South African entrepreneur Elon Musk is known for founding Tesla Motors and SpaceX, which launched a landmark commercial spacecraft in 2012. (1971-) Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers.  Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's administration. In January 2021, Musk reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as the wealthiest man in the world. Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child, Musk was so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing. At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, Musk developed an interest in computers. He taught himself how to program, and when he was 12 he sold his first software: a game he created called Blastar. In grade school, Musk was short, introverted and bookish. He was bullied until he was 15 and went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself with karate and wrestling. Musk’s mother, Maye Musk, is a Canadian model and the oldest woman to star in a Covergirl campaign. When Musk was growing up, she worked five jobs at one point to support her family. Musk’s father, Errol Musk, is a wealthy South African engineer.  Musk spent his early childhood with his brother Kimbal and sister Tosca in South Africa. His parents divorced when he was 10. At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain American citizenship via that path. In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics. After leaving Penn, Musk headed to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, his move was timed perfectly with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two days to become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation in 1995. Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002.  Musk launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation, in 1995 with his brother, Kimbal Musk. An online city guide, Zip2 was soon providing content for the new websites of both The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. In 1999, a division of Compaq Computer Corporation bought Zip2 for $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock options. In 1999, Elon and Kimbal Musk used the money from their sale of Zip2 to found X.com, an online financial services/payments company. An X.com acquisition the following year led to the creation of PayPal as it is known today.  In October 2002, Musk earned his first billion when PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. Before the sale, Musk owned 11 percent of PayPal stock. Musk founded his third company, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, in 2002 with the intention of building spacecraft for commercial space travel. By 2008, SpaceX was well established, and NASA awarded the company the contract to handle cargo transport for the International Space Station—with plans for astronaut transport in the future—in a move to replace NASA’s own space shuttle missions.   On May 22, 2012, Musk and SpaceX made history when the company launched its Falcon 9 rocket into space with an unmanned capsule. The vehicle was sent to the International Space Station with 1,000 pounds of supplies for the astronauts stationed there, marking the first time a private company had sent a spacecraft to the International Space Station. Of the launch, Musk was quoted as saying, ""I feel very lucky. ... For us, it's like winning the Super Bowl."" In December 2013, a Falcon 9 successfully carried a satellite to geosynchronous transfer orbit, a distance at which the satellite would lock into an orbital path that matched the Earth's rotation. In February 2015, SpaceX launched another Falcon 9 fitted with the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite, aiming to observe the extreme emissions from the sun that affect power grids and communications systems on Earth.  In March 2017, SpaceX saw the successful test flight and landing of a Falcon 9 rocket made from reusable parts, a development that opened the door for more affordable space travel.  A setback came in November 2017, when an explosion occurred during a test of the company's new Block 5 Merlin engine. SpaceX reported that no one was hurt, and that the issue would not hamper its planned rollout of a future generation of Falcon 9 rockets. The company enjoyed another milestone moment in February 2018 with the successful test launch of the powerful Falcon Heavy rocket. Armed with additional Falcon 9 boosters, the Falcon Heavy was designed to carry immense payloads into orbit and potentially serve as a vessel for deep space missions. For the test launch, the Falcon Heavy was given a payload of Musk's cherry-red Tesla Roadster, equipped with cameras to ""provide some epic views"" for the vehicle's planned orbit around the sun. In July 2018, Space X enjoyed the successful landing of a new Block 5 Falcon rocket, which touched down on a drone ship less than 9 minutes after liftoff. In September 2017, Musk presented an updated design plan for his BFR (an acronym for either ""Big F---ing Rocket"" or ""Big Falcon Rocket""), a 31-engine behemoth topped by a spaceship capable of carrying at least 100 people. He revealed that SpaceX was aiming to launch the first cargo missions to Mars with the vehicle in 2022, as part of his overarching goal of colonizing the Red Planet. In March 2018, the entrepreneur told an audience at the annual South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, that he hoped to have the BFR ready for short flights early the following year, while delivering a knowing nod at his previous problems with meeting deadlines. The following month, it was announced that SpaceX would construct a facility at the Port of Los Angeles to build and house the BFR. The port property presented an ideal location for SpaceX, as its mammoth rocket will only be movable by barge or ship when completed.  In late March 2018, SpaceX received permission from the U.S. government to launch a fleet of satellites into low orbit for the purpose of providing Internet service. The satellite network, named Starlink, would ideally make broadband service more accessible in rural areas, while also boosting competition in heavily populated markets that are typically dominated by one or two providers.  SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites in May 2019, and followed with another payload of 60 satellites that November. While this represented significant progress for the Starlink venture, the appearance of these bright orbiters in the night sky, with the potential of thousands more to come, worried astronomers who felt that a proliferation of satellites would increase the difficulty of studying distant objects in space. Musk is the co-founder, CEO and product architect at Tesla Motors, a company formed in 2003 that is dedicated to producing affordable, mass-market electric cars as well as battery products and solar roofs. Musk oversees all product development, engineering and design of the company's products.  Five years after its formation, in March 2008, Tesla unveiled the Roadster, a sports car capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds, as well as traveling nearly 250 miles between charges of its lithium ion battery.  With a stake in the company taken by Daimler and a strategic partnership with Toyota, Tesla Motors launched its initial public offering in June 2010, raising $226 million. In August 2008, Tesla announced plans for its Model S, the company's first electric sedan that was reportedly meant to take on the BMW 5 series. In 2012, the Model S finally entered production at a starting price of $58,570. Capable of covering 265 miles between charges, it was honored as the 2013 Car of the Year by Motor Trend magazine. In April 2017, Tesla announced that it surpassed General Motors to become the most valuable U.S. car maker. The news was an obvious boon to Tesla, which was looking to ramp up production and release its Model 3 sedan later that year.  In September 2019, using what Musk described as a ""Plaid powertrain,"" a Model S set a speed record for four-door sedan at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey County, California. The Model 3 was officially launched in early 2019 following extensive production delays. The car was initially priced at $35,000, a much more accessible price point than the $69,500 and up for its Model S and X electric sedans. After initially aiming to produce 5,000 new Model 3 cars per week by December 2017, Musk pushed that goal back to March 2018, and then to June with the start of the new year. The announced delay didn't surprise industry experts, who were well aware of the company's production problems, though some questioned how long investors would remain patient with the process. It also didn't prevent Musk from garnering a radical new compensation package as CEO, in which he would be paid after reaching milestones of growing valuation based on $50 billion increments.  By April 2018, with Tesla expected to fall short of first-quarter production forecasts, news surfaced that Musk had pushed aside the head of engineering to personally oversee efforts in that division. In a Twitter exchange with a reporter, Musk said it was important to ""divide and conquer"" to meet production goals and was ""back to sleeping at factory."" After signaling that the company would reorganize its management structure, Musk in June announced that Tesla was laying off 9 percent of its workforce, though its production department would remain intact. In an email to employees, Musk explained his decision to eliminate some ""duplication of roles"" to cut costs, admitting it was time to take serious steps toward turning a profit. The restructuring appeared to pay dividends, as it was announced that Tesla had met its goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 cars per week by the end of June 2018, while churning out another 2,000 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. ""We did it!"" Musk wrote in a celebratory email to the company. ""What an incredible job by an amazing team."" The following February, Musk announced that the company was finally rolling out its standard Model 3. Musk also said that Tesla was shifting to all-online sales, and offering customers the chance to return their cars within seven days or 1,000 miles for a full refund.  In November 2017, Musk made another splash with the unveiling of the new Tesla Semi and Roadster at the company's design studio. The semi-truck, which was expected to enter into production in 2019 before being delayed, boasts 500 miles of range as well as a battery and motors built to last 1 million miles. In March 2019, Musk unveiled Tesla’s long-awaited Model Y. The compact crossover, which began arriving for customers in March 2020, has a driving range of 300 miles and a 0 to 60 mph time of 3.5 seconds. The Roadster, also set to be released in 2020, will become the fastest production car ever made, with a 0 to 60 time of 1.9 seconds. In August 2016, in Musk’s continuing effort to promote and advance sustainable energy and products for a wider consumer base, a $2.6 billion dollar deal was solidified to combine his electric car and solar energy companies. His Tesla Motors Inc. announced an all-stock deal purchase of SolarCity Corp., a company Musk had helped his cousins start in 2006. He is a majority shareholder in each entity. “Solar and storage are at their best when they're combined. As one company, Tesla (storage) and SolarCity (solar) can create fully integrated residential, commercial and grid-scale products that improve the way that energy is generated, stored and consumed,” read a statement on Tesla’s website about the deal. In January 2017, Musk launched The Boring Company, a company devoted to boring and building tunnels in order to reduce street traffic. He began with a test dig on the SpaceX property in Los Angeles.  In late October of that year, Musk posted the first photo of his company's progress to his Instagram page. He said the 500-foot tunnel, which would generally run parallel to Interstate 405, would reach a length of two miles in approximately four months. In May 2019 the company, now known as TBC, landed a $48.7 million contract from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority to build an underground Loop system to shuttle people around the Las Vegas Convention Center. In October 2022, Musk officially bought Twitter and became the social media company's CEO after months of back and forth. DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S ELON MUSK FACT CARD   On August 7, 2018, Musk dropped a bombshell via a tweet: ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."" The announcement opened the door for legal action against the company and its founder, as the SEC began inquiring about whether Musk had indeed secured the funding as claimed. Several investors filed lawsuits on the grounds that Musk was looking to manipulate stock prices and ambush short sellers with his tweet. Musk’s tweet initially sent Tesla stock spiking, before it closed the day up 11 percent. The CEO followed up with a letter on the company blog, calling the move to go private ""the best path forward."" He promised to retain his stake in the company, and added that he would create a special fund to help all current investors remain on board. Six days later, Musk sought to clarify his position with a statement in which he pointed to discussions with the managing director of the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund as the source of his ""funding secured"" declaration. He later tweeted that he was working on a proposal to take Tesla private with Goldman Sachs and Silver Lake as financial advisers.  The saga took a bizarre turn that day when rapper Azealia Banks wrote on Instagram that, as a guest at Musk's home at the time, she learned that he was under the influence of LSD when he fired off his headline-grabbing tweet. Banks said she overheard Musk making phone calls to drum up the funding he promised was already in place.  The news quickly turned serious again when it was reported that Tesla's outside directors had retained two law firms to deal with the SEC inquiry and the CEO's plans to take the company private. On August 24, one day after meeting with the board, Musk announced that he had reversed course and would not be taking the company private. Among his reasons, he cited the preference of most directors to keep Tesla public, as well as the difficulty of retaining some of the large shareholders who were prohibited from investing in a private company. Others suggested that Musk was also influenced by the poor optics of an electric car company being funded by Saudi Arabia, a country heavily involved in the oil industry. On September 29, 2018, it was announced that Musk would pay a $20 million fine and step down as chairman of Tesla's board for three years as part of an agreement with the SEC. In August 2013, Musk released a concept for a new form of transportation called the ""Hyperloop,"" an invention that would foster commuting between major cities while severely cutting travel time. Ideally resistant to weather and powered by renewable energy, the Hyperloop would propel riders in pods through a network of low-pressure tubes at speeds reaching more than 700 mph. Musk noted that the Hyperloop could take from seven to 10 years to be built and ready for use. Although he introduced the Hyperloop with claims that it would be safer than a plane or train, with an estimated cost of $6 billion — approximately one-tenth of the cost for the rail system planned by the state of California — Musk's concept has drawn skepticism. Nevertheless, the entrepreneur has sought to encourage the development of this idea.  After he announced a competition for teams to submit their designs for a Hyperloop pod prototype, the first Hyperloop Pod Competition was held at the SpaceX facility in January 2017. A speed record of 284 mph was set by a German student engineering team at competition No. 3 in 2018, with the same team pushing the record to 287 mph the next year. Musk has pursued an interest in artificial intelligence, becoming co-chair of the nonprofit OpenAI. The research company launched in late 2015 with the stated mission of advancing digital intelligence to benefit humanity.  In 2017, it was also reported that Musk was backing a venture called Neuralink, which intends to create devices to be implanted in the human brain and help people merge with software. He expanded on the company's progress during a July 2019 discussion, revealing that its devices will consist of a microscopic chip that connects via Bluetooth to a smartphone.  In late November 2017, after Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel asked for proposals to build and operate a high-speed rail line that would transport passengers from O'Hare Airport to downtown Chicago in 20 minutes or less, Musk tweeted that he was all-in on the competition with The Boring Company. He said that the concept of the Chicago loop would be different from his Hyperloop, its relatively short route not requiring the need for drawing a vacuum to eliminate air friction. In summer 2018 Musk announced he would cover the estimated $1 billion needed to dig the 17-mile tunnel from the airport to downtown Chicago. However, in late 2019 he tweeted that TBC would focus on completing the commercial tunnel in Las Vegas before turning to other projects, suggesting that plans for Chicago would remain in limbo for the immediate future.  Musk also reportedly found a market for The Boring Company's flamethrowers. After announcing they were going on sale for $500 apiece in late January 2018, he claimed to have sold 10,000 of them within a day. In December 2016, Musk was named to President Trump’s Strategy and Policy Forum; the following January, he joined Trump's Manufacturing Jobs Initiative. Following Trump’s election, Musk found himself on common ground with the new president and his advisers as the president announced plans to pursue massive infrastructure developments. While sometimes at odds with the president's controversial measures, such as a proposed ban on immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, Musk defended his involvement with the new administration. ""My goals,"" he tweeted in early 2017, ""are to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy and to help make humanity a multi-planet civilization, a consequence of which will be the creating of hundreds of thousands of jobs and a more inspiring future for all."" On June 1, following Trump's announcement that he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, Musk stepped down from his advisory roles. Musk has been married twice. He wed Justine Wilson in 2000, and the couple had six children together. In 2002, their first son died at 10 weeks old from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Musk and Wilson had five additional sons together: twins Griffin and Xavier (born in 2004) and triplets Kai, Saxon and Damian (born in 2006). After a contentious divorce from Wilson, Musk met actress Talulah Riley. The couple married in 2010. They split in 2012 but married each other again in 2013. Their relationship ultimately ended in divorce in 2016.  Musk reportedly began dating actress Amber Heard in 2016 after finalizing his divorce with Riley and Heard finalized her divorce from Johnny Depp. Their busy schedules caused the couple to break up in August 2017; they got back together in January 2018 and split again one month later. In May 2018, Musk began dating musician Grimes (born Claire Boucher). That month, Grimes announced that she had changed her name to “c,” the symbol for the speed of light, reportedly on the encouragement of Musk. Fans criticized the feminist performer for dating a billionaire whose company has been described as a “predator zone” among accusations of sexual harassment.  The couple discussed their love for one another in a March 2019 feature in the Wall Street Journal Magazine, with Grimes saying “Look, I love him, he’s great...I mean, he’s a super-interesting goddamn person.” Musk, for his part, told the Journal, “I love c’s wild fae artistic creativity and hyper-intense work ethic.”  Grimes gave birth to their son on May 4, 2020, with Musk announcing that they had named the boy ""X Æ A-12."" Later in the month, after it was reported that the State of California wouldn't accept a name with a number, the couple said they were changing their son's name to ""X Æ A-Xii."" Musk and Grimes welcomed their second child, a daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk, in December 2021. The child was delivered via a surrogate. The boundless potential of space exploration and the preservation of the future of the human race have become the cornerstones of Musk's abiding interests, and toward these, he has founded the Musk Foundation, which is dedicated to space exploration and the discovery of renewable and clean energy sources. In October 2019 Musk pledged to donate $1 million to the #TeamTrees campaign, which aims to plant 20 million trees around the world by 2020. He even changed his Twitter name to Treelon for the occasion.  We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!

Tesla chief executive Elon Musk addresses guests at a conference in Norway. ... The world's ...","The world's richest man, Elon Musk, has completed his $44bn (£38.1bn) takeover of Twitter, according to a filing with the US government. Mr Musk tweeted ""the bird is freed"" and later said ""let the good times roll"". A number of top executives, including the boss, Parag Agrawal, have reportedly been fired. Mr Agrawal and two other executives were escorted out of Twitter's San Francisco headquarters on Thursday evening, said Reuters. The completion of the deal brings to an end months of legal wrangling but it has prompted questions over the platform's future direction. A filing was made with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, confirming the takeover.  The New York Stock Exchange said on Friday that trading in Twitter's shares had been suspended, giving the reason as ""merger effective"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to read Twitter’s cookie policy, external and privacy policy, external before accepting. To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’. Chief financial officer Ned Segal, and the firm's top legal and policy executive, Vijaya Gadde, are leaving alongside Mr Agrawal, according to US media reports.  Twitter co-founder Biz Stone appeared to confirm the executives' departure. In a tweet, he thanked all three for their ""collective contribution to Twitter"", calling them ""massive talents"" and ""beautiful humans"". Meanwhile, Bret Taylor - who had served as Twitter's chairman since last November - updated his LinkedIn profile to indicate that he was no longer in the post. Mr Musk, a self-styled ""free speech absolutist"", has been critical of Twitter's management and its moderation policies.  They clashed over the terms of the takeover, with Mr Musk accusing Twitter of providing misleading information about the firm's user numbers. He has also said he would reverse bans on suspended users, which could include former US President Donald Trump, who was excluded following the Capitol riot in January 2021.  At the time, Twitter said there was a risk Mr Trump would incite further violence. But Mr Musk has described the ban as ""foolish"". Earlier this week, Mr Musk said that he doesn't want the platform to become an echo chamber for hate and division. ""Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hell-scape, where anything can be said with no consequences!"" he tweeted.  The takeover has prompted discussion among Twitter users over what the platform will look like under Mr Musk's ownership. There are fears that more lenient free speech policies would mean people banned for hate speech or disinformation may be invited back to the platform. As well as Mr Trump, that could include political extremists, QAnon loyalists and Covid-19 deniers. In response to Mr Musk's missive, Thierry Breton the EU commissioner for the internal market tweeted ""In Europe, the bird will fly by our EU rules"" suggesting regulators will take a tough stance against any relaxation of Twitter's policies. Mr Musk as well as being the world's richest person with $250bn to his name, is a controversial figure.  He made his fortune through the electric car company Tesla, and space exploration firm Space X. But he has drawn additional attention by his outspoken intervention in unrelated matters, often using Twitter as the platform, ranging from geopolitical issues such as the war in Ukraine to the rescue of the schoolboys trapped in a Thai cave. It is not clear yet whether the clear out of senior management is the forerunner to company-wide job cuts. Earlier reports suggested 75% of staff at the social media company were set to lose their jobs but those reports were ""inaccurate"", according to Ross Gerber, a shareholder in both Twitter and Mr Musk's other company Tesla. ""There are a lot of talented people at Twitter, especially on the engineering side and they want to retain as much of that talent as possible,"" Mr Gerber told the BBC. But he said the job losses could nevertheless extend far beyond upper management. Mr Musk might look to cut product managers and end projects ""that aren't going anywhere"" he said. Until recently it appeared the deal could still fall through. After building a stake in Twitter at the start of the year, Mr Musk made his $44bn offer in April, a price tag that looked too high almost as soon as it was agreed. He said he was buying it because he wanted ""civilisation to have a common digital town square"" and said he planned to clean up spam accounts and preserve the platform as a venue for free speech. But by the summer he had changed his mind about the purchase, citing concerns that the number of fake accounts on the platform was higher than Twitter claimed. The Elon Musk Show From South Africa to Silicon Valley - the enigmatic, compelling and controversial inside story of the world's richest man, as told by family, friends and enemies. Watch Now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Eventually Twitter executives took legal action to hold Mr Musk to his offer and while he recently admitted he and the other investors involved in the deal were ""overpaying for Twitter right now"", the deal does now appear to have gone through. But speculation continues around Mr Musk's intentions for the platform. Earlier this week, he changed his Twitter profile to read ""Chief Twit"" and some observers believe he will take the reins at the firm himself. Mr Musk also tweeted a video of himself walking into Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco carrying a sink with the caption: ""let that sink in!"" There has been no comment yet from Twitter about its new management team. But whoever becomes its next chief executive, it is clear that Mr Musk will ultimately be in charge of the company - a role he will have to balance with his management positions at both Tesla and SpaceX. He sat briefly on Twitter's board earlier this year, and criticised the firm's strategy. In private messages revealed in court filings, Mr Musk talked about how Mr Agrawal didn't understand how to fix the social media platform's problems. Mr Musk has also posted that his plans for Twitter include more ambitious changes including ""X, the app for everything"".  Some suggest this might be something along the lines of the hugely successful Chinese app WeChat, a kind of ""super app"" that incorporates different services including messaging, social media, payments and food orders.

Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News          Elon Musk on Sunday gave credence to a fringe conspiracy theory about the violent attack on Paul Pelosi.        The new Twitter owner tweeted a link to an article full of baseless claims about Pelosi. The article was posted on a website that purports to be a news outlet.
   
      Musk, who has 112 million followers on the platform he now owns, posted the baseless story about Pelosi in response to a tweet from Hilary Clinton at 8:15 am ET. He later deleted the tweet around 2 pm, but not before racking up more than 28,000 retweets and 100,000 likes.
   
      Linking to a Los Angeles Times story about Pelosi’s alleged attacker, Clinton wrote, “The Republican Party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and deranged conspiracy theories. It is shocking, but not surprising, that violence is the result. As citizens, we must hold them accountable for their words and the actions that follow.”
   
      In response, Musk linked to the baseless story, and wrote, “There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye.”
   
      In 2016 the same website falsely claimed that Clinton had died and that the person on the presidential campaign trail was not Clinton but her body double. 
   
      Musk’s post comes amid concerns about how the billionaire will run Twitter and if misinformation and hate will be given a bigger platform on the site. 
   
      A Twitter spokesperson did not immediately return a CNN request for comment.
   
      Musk’s takeover — which was finalized Thursday night — not only has the potential to create upheaval for Twitter
            
                (TWTR) employees but also for the hundreds of millions of people around the world who use the platform daily. It could also impact the upcoming US midterm elections, if Musk makes good on his promise to restore the accounts of users who were previously banned from the platform, most notably former US President Donald Trump, and limit the company’s content restrictions.
   
      In the first weeks after agreeing to buy the company in April, and before his initial move to bail on the deal, Musk repeatedly stressed that his goal was to bolster “free speech” on the platform and work to “unlock” Twitter’s “extraordinary potential.” The Tesla CEO suggested he would rethink Twitter’s approach to content moderation and permanent bans, with potential impacts on civil discourse and the political landscape. He also talked about his desire to rid the platform of bots, even as he later made the number of bots central to his argument to abandon the deal.

Musk has been deluged with demands from banned account holders and world leaders. He said Twitter will form a content-moderation council ...","[1/2]Elon Musk's photo is seen through a Twitter logo in this illustration taken October 28, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration  Acquire Licensing Rights Oct 28 (Reuters) - Mere hours after Elon Musk kicked off a new era at Twitter Inc, the billionaire owner was deluged with pleas and demands from banned account holders and world leaders. The flood of requests underscore the challenge the CEO of electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) faces, balancing a promise to restore free speech while preventing the platform from descending into a ""hellscape,"" as he had vowed in an open letter to advertisers on Thursday. Former U.S. President Donald Trump, who was permanently banned from Twitter over accusations of inciting violence after the Jan. 6, 2021 capitol riots, welcomed the takeover, but said little about a return to Twitter. ""I am very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands, and will no longer be run by Radical Left Lunatics and Maniacs who truly hate our country.""  read more  Dmitry Medvedev, former Russia president and current deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, tweeted his congratulations: ""Good luck @elonmusk in overcoming political bias and ideological dictatorship on Twitter. And quit that Starlink in Ukraine business."" Others asked Musk to reverse penalties inflicted by the social media platform. In response to @catturd2, an anonymous account with 852,000 followers, known for being a big supporter of Trump's election fraud claims, and who said it was ""shadowbanned,"" Musk tweeted ""I will be digging in more today."" The editor-in-chief of Russian state-controlled broadcaster RT, Margarita Simonyan, asked Musk to ""unban RT and Sputnik accounts and take the shadow ban off mine as well?"" The pressure is mounting on Musk and Twitter as he is set to address the Twitter staff on Friday after closing the deal. ""Hey @ElonMusk, now that you own Twitter, will you help fight back against Trudeau's online censorship bill C-11?"" tweeted Canada Proud, an organization working to vote out Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""First I've heard,"" Musk responded in a tweet on Friday. Several employees who spoke with Reuters on Friday said there had been no communication from management about what happens next. Musk was expected to address employees on Friday, but the employees said they had not received any notice by the late afternoon. Two sources familiar with the matter said Musk's teams were investigating Twitter's code and asking questions about how aspects of the platform work. Musk appeared to have joined the company's Slack channel by Friday, according to a screenshot seen by Reuters. Musk also tweeted on Friday that Twitter will form a ""content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints,"" and that no major decisions on moderation or account reinstatements will be made before it convenes. Despite an appeal to advertisers on Thursday that he hoped to make Twitter ""the most respected advertising platform in the world,"" at least one major automaker - GM (GM.N) - said it temporarily paused its advertising and was working to ""understand the direction of the platform under their new ownership."" Employees also continued to fret about the future of their jobs. Fewer than 10% of 266 Twitter employees who participated in a poll on messaging app Blind expected to still have their jobs in three months. Blind allows employees to air grievances anonymously after they sign up with corporate emails. Musk fired Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal and legal affairs and policy chief Vijaya Gadde, according to people familiar with the matter. He had accused them of misleading him and Twitter investors over the number of fake accounts on the platform. Agrawal and Segal were in Twitter's San Francisco headquarters when the deal closed and were escorted out, the sources added. Musk, who also runs rocket company SpaceX, plans to become Twitter's interim CEO, according to a person familiar with the matter and following an earlier report by Reuters. Musk also plans to scrap permanent bans on users, Bloomberg said, citing a person familiar with the matter. Twitter, Musk and the executives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Before closing the deal, Musk walked into Twitter's headquarters on Wednesday with a big grin and a porcelain sink, subsequently tweeting ""let that sink in."" He changed his Twitter profile description to ""Chief Twit."" European regulators also reiterated past warnings that, under Musk's leadership, Twitter must still abide by the region's Digital Services Act, which levies hefty fines on companies if they do not control illegal content. ""In Europe, the bird will fly by our EU rules,"" EU industry chief Thierry Breton tweeted on Friday morning. European Parliament lawmaker and civil rights proponent Patrick Breyer suggested people look for alternatives where privacy is a priority. ""Twitter already knows our personalities dangerously well due to its pervasive surveillance of our every click. Now this knowledge will be falling into Musk's hands."" Musk has indicated he sees Twitter as a foundation for creating a ""super app"" that offers everything from money transfers to shopping and ride-hailing. But Twitter is struggling to engage its most active users who are vital to the business. These ""heavy tweeters"" account for less than 10% of monthly overall users but generate 90% of all tweets and half of global revenue. Musk will face a challenge building revenue ""given that the controversial opinions he appears to want to give more of a free rein to are often unpalatable to advertisers,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter. As news of the deal spread, some Twitter users were quick to flag their willingness to walk away. ""I will be happy to leave in a heartbeat if Musk, well, acts as we all expect him to,"" said a user with the @mustlovedogsxo account.

							  Roula Khalaf Simply sign up to the Life & Arts myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Dinner with Elon Musk begins with a drive in a Tesla. I am seated in the back, next to X, the billionaire’s two-and-a-half-year-old son. It’s around 7pm in Austin, and X is, as one would expect, cranky. We had set off to Fonda San Miguel, Musk’s favourite Mexican restaurant, after a visit with an FT colleague to the Tesla Gigafactory on the banks of the Colorado river. In this massive site Musk is producing the Y electric SUVs, the latest model in the Tesla collection that has catapulted him to the top of the world’s rich list (net worth: $232bn). Musk, with X perched on his shoulders, had proudly shown off the factory floor as he periodically raged against sluggish investment in lithium refining, which is desperately needed to ease battery shortages around the world. Musk’s security chief, the designated driver, comes to the rescue with a milk bottle that soothes X to sleep by the time we reach the restaurant. For the next couple of hours, I am better acquainted with the curious character of Elon Musk, the engineer and the visionary, the billionaire and the disrupter, the agitator and the troublemaker. Defying armies of sceptics, including myself (full disclosure: until my family rebelled against me and bought a Tesla Model 3 and I started driving it, I was convinced the company would go bankrupt), Musk has built Tesla into a more than $700bn market cap business and forced the car industry to speed up the shift to electric vehicles. Not prone to modesty, Musk estimates he may have accelerated the “advent of sustainable energy” by “10, maybe even 20 years”.  In just over a decade, he has also transformed the commercial space industry and the economics of space, racing ahead of rivals in building a reusable rocket that can carry passengers. Nasa has picked his Starship to land astronauts on the moon over the next few years. It is now worth around $125bn. One day, or so Musk is convinced, it will be used to colonise Mars. Musk is a maverick too, a serial tweeter to his more than 100mn followers who flouts convention, revels in outrageous outbursts, fights with regulators and staff, and taunts competitors. He has regular run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission: he was fined and forced to give up his chairmanship of Tesla over 2018 tweets in which he claimed to have secured funding to take Tesla private, statements that a US judge later described as having been made “recklessly”. A recent lawsuit accuses Musk of running a pyramid scheme to prop up dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that is, literally, based on a joke — an internet meme of a Japanese dog. Dogecoin has predictably crashed but Musk’s enthusiasm has not: he twins his black jeans with a black T-shirt featuring an image of the dog.   Why does a serious guy with serious ideas indulge in silly Twitter games that could also cost his followers dearly? “Aren’t you entertained?” Musk roars with laughter. “I play the fool on Twitter and often shoot myself in the foot and cause myself all sorts of trouble . . . I don’t know, I find it vaguely therapeutic to express myself on Twitter. It’s a way to get messages out to the public.” It is fair to say that Musk is obsessed with Twitter, so much so that he’s been embroiled in an epic on/off buyout of the platform that has captivated Wall Street and the tech industry for months. Twitter sued Musk (and he sued back) after he backed out of a $44bn acquisition deal he made in April, accusing the social media company of under-reporting the number of bots on the platform. This week, and just before his scheduled deposition, Musk changed his mind. He now says he wants to buy Twitter again. I had asked over dinner whether his original offer had been a bad joke. “Twitter is certainly an invitation to increase your pain level,” he says. “I guess I must be a masochist . . . ” But he makes no secret that his interest in the company has never been primarily financial: “I’m not doing Twitter for the money. It’s not like I’m trying to buy some yacht and I can’t afford it. I don’t own any boats. But I think it’s important that people have a maximally trusted and inclusive means of exchanging ideas and that it should be as trusted and transparent as possible.” The alternative, he says, is a splintering of debate into different social-media bubbles, as evidenced by Donald Trump’s Truth Social network. “It [Truth Social] is essentially a rightwing echo chamber. It might as well be called Trumpet.” Musk doesn’t eat lunch, possibly because an unflattering picture in a swimsuit taken on a yacht in Mykonos went viral over the summer. Since then, he has been on a diet. At Fonda San Miguel, a teeming Mexican restaurant that promises a regional culinary experience, he is a familiar dinner customer. He orders a frozen margarita (he calls it a slushy with alcohol) and I order a beer. Musk looks around. “There’s a good buzz in this restaurant,” he says approvingly, and suggests to the waiter that they serve us some of their specialities. Musk is telling me that companies are like children when the first plates land on the table: the lamb chops in a pepper sauce, and shrimp with cheese and jalapeños. The food is “epic”, Musk gasps.  It’s important that people die. How long would you have liked Stalin to live? Musk is capricious, but he sees himself as a problem solver, and the problem is everything from the potential end of life on Earth to climate change and even traffic (his Boring company is building tunnels). Recently, he has dreamt up his own (rather unhelpful) peace plan for ending Russia’s war in Ukraine. Born and raised in South Africa in a well-to-do family, he landed in California after studying economics and physics in Canada and Pennsylvania. One of his first big ideas was well ahead of its time: he wanted to revolutionise banking. He merged an online payments business he co-founded with another company in what became PayPal. When PayPal was sold to eBay, he used the money to start SpaceX and invest in Tesla.   Ageing strikes me as the only threat to humans that he is not attempting to resolve, though another company he founded, Neuralink, is designing chips that will be implanted in the brain to restore sensory and motor function. Musk is very exercised about population decline, and claims to be doing his part to populate Earth by having 10 children (from various partners), including, it was recently reported, twins with an executive at Neuralink.  He scoffs when I inquire if there are other children he has fathered — “I’m pretty sure there are no other babies looming” — and he dismisses the wild rumours that he has bought a fertility clinic to support his production of babies. Some friends, he reveals, have indeed suggested he should have 500 kids, but that would be a “bit weird”. Referring to himself, aged 51, as an “autumn chicken”, he says he may have more children, but only to the extent that he can be a good father to them. Nonetheless, he predicts that “the current trend for most countries is that civilisation will not die with a bang, it will die with a whimper in adult diapers”. But he says ageing should not be solved. “It’s important that people die. How long would you have liked Stalin to live?” That is a good point.   Musk’s bigger worry is the preservation of life beyond Earth. His solution is to populate Mars. “Something will happen to Earth eventually, it’s just a question of time. Eventually the sun will expand and destroy all life on Earth, so we do need to move at some point, or at least be a multi-planet species,” he says. “You have to ask the question: do we want to be a space-flying civilisation and a multi-planet species or not?” I’m not sure what I think but Musk is emphatic. “It’s a question of what percentage of resources should we devote to such an endeavour? I think if you say 1 per cent of resources, that’s probably a reasonable amount.”  Would Musk himself join the pioneering colony on Mars? “Especially if I’m getting old, I’ll do it. Why not?” he says. But how useful would he be to Mars if he’s too old? “I think there’s some non-trivial chance of dying, so I’d prefer to take that chance when I’m a bit older, and see my kids grow up. Rather than right now, where little X is only two-and-a-half. I think he’d miss me.”  The table is too small for the large plates we are sharing as a second course: a slow-cooked lamb that melts in the mouth, chillies in a walnut-based sauce and shrimp in creamy chipotle sauce. Musk is right: it is the best Mexican food I’ve ever had.  We turn to his views on government and politics and the Twitter Musk appears, the more emotional, unrestrained persona that comes across in his frenetic posts. He is lauding billionaires as the most efficient stewards of capital, best placed to decide on the allocation of social benefits. “If the alternative steward of capital is the government, that is actually not going to be to the benefit of the people,” says Musk.

Then to follow it up, to add insult to injury, at a big event he said that GM was leading the electric car revolution, in the same quarter that GM shipped 26 electric cars and we shipped 300,000. Does that seem fair to you?”  Until recently Musk voted Democrat, although he is now more on the Republican side, or perhaps floating somewhere in between. He says he is considering setting up “the Super Moderate Super Pac” to support candidates with moderate views. He makes a point of telling me that he doesn’t hate Trump, even if he has clashed with him, and insists Biden is simply too old to run for a second term in office. “You don’t want to be too far from the average age of the population because it’s going to be very difficult to stay in touch . . . Maybe one generation away from the average age is OK, but two generations? At the point where you’ve got great-grandchildren, I don’t know, how in touch with the people are you? Is it even possible to be?” I’m subject to literally a million laws and regulations and I obey almost 99.99 per cent of them Musk has a dystopian view of the left’s influence on America, which helps explain his wild pursuit of Twitter to liberate free speech. He blames the fact that his teenage daughter no longer wants to be associated with him on the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists. “It’s full-on communism . . . and a general sentiment that if you’re rich, you’re evil,” says Musk. “It [the relationship] may change, but I have very good relationships with all the others [children]. Can’t win them all.” He also has a dim view of regulators, whom he sees as bureaucrats justifying their jobs by going after high-profile targets like him. He seems to be in a constant feud with one regulator or another, whether it’s over his own pronouncements or over the treatment of staff. Musk is unabashed about driving his employees hard. He was bullied as a child (and has also spoken of emotional abuse by his father) but is now sometimes accused of bullying others. He shoots back: if anyone is unhappy working for him, they should work elsewhere because “they’re not chained to the company, it’s voluntary”.  Does he ever think he’s above the law? That’s utter nonsense, he tells me: “I’m subject to literally a million laws and regulations and I obey almost 99.99 per cent of them. It’s only when I think the law is contrary to the interest of the people that I have an issue.” I wonder if he means the interest of Elon Musk.  There are some topics that amuse Musk, eliciting prolonged laughter, and other questions that are met with deliberate silence before he speaks. The longest silence follows my question about China and the risk to Tesla’s Shanghai factory, which produces between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of Tesla’s total production. Musk has been an admirer of as well as an investor in China. But he is not immune to the gathering US-China tensions or the risk of a Chinese takeover of Taiwan. Musk says Beijing has made clear its disapproval of his recent rollout of Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite communications system, in Ukraine to help the military circumvent Russia’s cut-off of the internet. He says Beijing sought assurances that he would not sell Starlink in China.  Musk reckons that conflict over Taiwan is inevitable but he is quick to point out that he won’t be alone in suffering the consequences. Tesla will be caught up in any conflict, he says, though, curiously, he seems to assume that the Shanghai factory will still be able to supply to customers in China, but not anywhere else. “Apple would be in very deep trouble, that’s for sure . . . ” he adds, not to mention the global economy, which he estimates, with precision, will take a 30 per cent hit.  It may be Musk’s realisation that business decisions can no longer be made without regard to security and geopolitics — or perhaps it’s simply an arrogant belief that he has all the answers — that now leads him to offer his own solutions to the world’s most complex geopolitical problems. “My recommendation . . . would be to figure out a special administrative zone for Taiwan that is reasonably palatable, probably won’t make everyone happy. And it’s possible, and I think probably, in fact, that they could have an arrangement that’s more lenient than Hong Kong.” I doubt his proposal will be taken up.  On Ukraine too, he has advocated a compromise with Russia that has earned him ridicule in Kyiv, where Starlink had made him a hero until now. He launched his peace plan in a poll on Twitter and suggested that Crimea, which Russia invaded in 2014 and later annexed, should simply be given away to Russia. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, shot back with his own Twitter poll: which Elon Musk do you like more, he asked, the one who supports Ukraine or the one who supports Russia? We are over an hour into dinner and Musk is in a hurry, having scheduled a call with his SpaceX team. We skip dessert and I ask for the bill, only to find out it’s already been settled by Musk’s security chief. Musk ignores my protestations that he is flouting Lunch with the FT convention: “You’re indebted to me for life,” he jokes. We head back to the car that is taking him to a private airport to board his jet and he suggests we continue our conversation on the way. I find X exactly where I left him, in his car seat, but he’s more cheerful after his nap. He is cooing as he watches videos of rockets on his iPad while his dad discusses rockets with his team. Suddenly, I notice that the car is driving itself, as if to dispel the doubts I had expressed about Tesla’s self-driving prospects. “It can get to the airport without intervention,” says Musk. Alarmed, I put my seatbelt on. Musk could be a magician, but he could also be wrong.

Elon Musk has taken ownership of Twitter Inc with brutal efficiency, firing top executives but providing little clarity over how he will ...","NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Elon Musk has taken ownership of Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) with brutal efficiency, firing top executives but providing little clarity over how he will achieve the ambitions he has outlined for the influential social media platform. ""The bird is freed,"" he tweeted after he completed his $44 billion acquisition on Thursday, referencing Twitter's bird logo in an apparent nod to his desire to see the company have fewer limits on content that can be posted. The CEO of electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and self-described free speech absolutist has, however, also said he wants to prevent the platform from becoming an echo chamber for hate and division. Other goals include wanting to ""defeat"" spam bots on Twitter and make the algorithms that determine how content is presented to its users publicly available. Yet Musk has not offered details on how he will achieve all this and who will run the company. He has said he plans to cut jobs, leaving Twitter's 7,500 employees fretting about their future. He also said on Thursday he did not buy Twitter to make more money but ""to try to help humanity, whom I love."" Less that 10% of 266 Twitter employees who participated in a poll on messaging app Blind expected to still have their jobs in three months. Blind allows employees to air grievances anonymously after they sign up with corporate emails. Musk fired Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal and legal affairs and policy chief Vijaya Gadde, according to people familiar with the matter. He had accused them of misleading him and Twitter investors over the number of fake accounts on the platform. Agrawal and Segal were in Twitter's San Francisco headquarters when the deal closed and were escorted out, the sources added. Musk, who also runs rocket company SpaceX, plans to become Twitter's interim CEO according to a person familiar with the matter and following an earlier report by Reuters. Musk also plans to scrap permanent bans on users, Bloomberg said, citing a person familiar with the matter. Twitter, Musk and the executives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Before closing the deal, Musk walked into Twitter's headquarters on Wednesday with a big grin and a porcelain sink, subsequently tweeting ""let that sink in."" He changed his Twitter profile description to ""Chief Twit."" Musk said in May he would reverse Twitter's ban on Donald Trump, who's account was removed after the attack on the U.S. Capitol. A representative for Trump did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, but the former U.S. president previously said he won't return to the platform and has instead launched his own social media app, Truth Social. Musk tried to calm Twitter employee fears that major layoffs are coming and assured advertisers that his past criticism of Twitter's content moderation rules would not harm its appeal. ""Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!"" Musk said in an open letter to advertisers on Thursday. As news of the deal spread, some Twitter users were quick to flag their willingness to walk away. ""I will be happy to leave in a heartbeat if Musk, well, acts as we all expect him to,"" said a user with the @mustlovedogsxo account. [1/2]Twitter logo and a photo of Elon Musk are displayed through magnifier in this illustration taken October 27, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration  Acquire Licensing Rights European regulators also reiterated past warnings that, under Musk's leadership, Twitter must still abide by the region's Digital Services Act, which levies hefty fines on companies if they do not control illegal content. ""In Europe, the bird will fly by our EU rules,"" EU industry chief Thierry Breton tweeted on Friday morning. European Parliament lawmaker and civil rights proponent Patrick Breyer suggested people look for alternatives where privacy is a priority. ""Twitter already knows our personalities dangerously well due to its pervasive surveillance of our every click. Now this knowledge will be falling into Musk's hands."" Musk has indicated he sees Twitter as a foundation for creating a ""super app"" that offers everything from money transfers to shopping and ride-hailing. But Twitter is struggling to engage its most active users who are vital to the business. These ""heavy tweeters"" account for less than 10% of monthly overall users but generate 90% of all tweets and half of global revenue. Musk will face a challenge building revenue ""given that the controversial opinions he appears to want to give more of a free rein to are often unpalatable to advertisers,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter. The deal's road to fruition was full of twists and turns that sowed doubt over whether it would happen at all. It began on April 4, when Musk disclosed a 9.2% Twitter stake, becoming the company's largest shareholder. The world's richest person then agreed to join Twitter's board, only to balk at the last minute and offer to buy the company instead for $54.20 per share. Over the course of just one weekend later in April, the two sides reached a deal without Musk carrying out any due diligence on the company's confidential information. In the weeks that followed, Musk had second thoughts. He complained publicly about Twitter's spam accounts and his lawyers then accused Twitter of not complying with his requests for information on the subject. The acrimony resulted in Musk telling Twitter on July 8 he was terminating the deal. Four days later, Twitter sued Musk to force him to complete the acquisition. By then, the stock market had plunged on concerns about a potential recession. Twitter accused Musk of buyer's remorse, arguing he wanted out of the deal because he thought he overpaid. Most legal analysts thought Twitter would likely prevail in court. On Oct. 4, Musk performed another U-turn, offering to complete the deal as promised. He managed to do that, just one day ahead of a deadline to avoid going to trial. Twitter shares ended trade on Thursday up 0.3% at $53.86, just under the agreed price. The stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.

Elon Musk regularly tweets and shares controversial things on Twitter, but now that he's the boss, his actions take on new significance. In this photo, Musk  arrives for the Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 2, 2022, in New York. A surge in racist slurs, a coordinated campaign to spread antisemitic memes, an owner posting a baseless conspiracy theory: welcome to the first few days of Elon Musk's Twitter. Since the billionaire took control of the influential social media platform on Oct. 27, users, researchers and the company's own employees have been warning that trolls and other malicious actors are testing Twitter's limits, apparently emboldened by a new owner who has vowed to loosen its guardrails in the name of free speech. The incidents are raising particular alarm given that Americans are in the final days of voting in November's midterm elections, putting government agencies, civil society groups and social media companies on edge over the circulation of false information and hateful rhetoric that is fomenting real-world violence. Musk himself inflamed those concerns on Sunday when he tweeted a link to unfounded, homophobic allegations about the violent attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Replying to a tweet from Hillary Clinton about the attack, Musk wrote: ""there is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye."" He included a link to an article from the Santa Monica Observer, a fringe website with a history of publishing false stories, which makes lurid claims about the attack without evidence.  Musk, who has more than 112 million Twitter followers, deleted the post hours later, but not before it had been retweeted and liked tens of thousands of times. His tweet heightened fears that Twitter is headed into a new era of toxicity under Musk, who has fired the company's top leadership and dissolved its board, naming himself sole director. The billionaire Tesla CEO has long used his Twitter account to provoke, joke and troll. His posts take on a new significance now that he owns and controls the platform, however.  Yael Eisenstat, a former Facebook official now at the Anti-Defamation League, tweeted that for Musk to amplify an unfounded rumor ""days after claiming to advertisers that he's going to be a responsible leader, all I can say is: I'm not overreacting by expressing my concerns."" She was referring to an open letter Musk wrote to advertisers last week pledging that Twitter would not become a ""free-for-all hellscape.""  ""Actions always speak louder than words,"" Eisenstat wrote. Musk and Twitter did not respond to requests for comment. Musk is a self-described ""free speech absolutist"" who has criticized Twitter's restrictions on hate speech and misleading claims about elections and public health. He has previously said he thinks the platform should allow all legal speech. He's also said he opposes permanent bans and would reinstate banned accounts including that of former President Donald Trump, who was kicked off after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. On Friday Musk clarified that he has made no changes to Twitter's rules yet. He would not make any ""major content decisions or account reinstatements"" before convening a ""content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints,"" he said. But many on Twitter and other internet sites greeted news of his ownership as a signal that the old rules were gone. ""Elon Musk has said enough on Twitter even before his takeover to make people believe that he is on the side of saying whatever you want without consequences,"" said Sara Aniano, disinformation analyst at the Anti-Defamation League. In the first 24 hours after news broke that Musk had closed his $44 billion purchase, more than 1,200 tweets and retweet spread antisemitic posts and memes, according to the ADL's analysis. In the following days, they've been posted thousands more times. The ADL said the surge was being driven by a coordinated campaign on internet platforms popular with the far right, including 4chan, an anonymous message board that has generated previous harassment and trolling campaigns, and the messaging app Telegram. ""There were specific guidelines on 4chan on what to do, how to do it, and why they were doing it. And they were doing it to indoctrinate more users into their rallying cry against the Jews,"" Aniano said. Users of 4chan also encouraged each other to amplify derogatory slurs, according to the Network Contagion Research Institute. It found use of the n-word increased 500% immediately following Musk's purchase. Evidence suggests that bad actors are trying to test the limits on @Twitter. Several posts on 4chan encourage users to amplify derogatory slurs. For example, over the last 12 hours, the use of the n-word has increased nearly 500% from the previous average. pic.twitter.com/mEqziaWuMF According to data from Dataminr, a company that analyzes social media activity, use of several racist and homophobic slurs increased in the hours and days after Musk took control. Tweets and retweets containing the n-word were being posted more than 2,300 times an hour at the peak on Friday, the data showed. Twitter's head of safety and integrity, Yoel Roth, also warned of coordinated efforts to proliferate hateful posts and said the platform was banning users involved in the trolling campaign. ""Over the last 48 hours, we've seen a small number of accounts post a ton of Tweets that include slurs and other derogatory terms,"" he tweeted on Saturday evening, noting that just 300 accounts were responsible for more than 50,000 tweets using one slur. ""Bottom line up front: Twitter's policies haven't changed,"" Roth wrote. ""Hateful conduct has no place here. And we're taking steps to put a stop to an organized effort to make people think we have."" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor"

As one of his first moves, he fired several longtime top Twitter executives, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. One of those confirmed the deal was complete. Chief executive Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal and Vijaya Gadde, head of legal policy, trust, and safety, were let go, according to the people. Sean Edgett, the company’s general counsel, was also pushed out, one of the people said. The top executives were hastily escorted out of the company’s San Francisco headquarters. Racist tweets quickly surface after Musk closes Twitter deal Musk’s moves late Thursday signal his intentions to firmly put his stamp on Twitter. Musk has publicly criticized the company’s outgoing management over product decisions and content moderation, as well as saying he would restore former president Donald Trump’s account. Still, “Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!” Musk tweeted Thursday, in a post offering assurances to advertisers. Late in the evening, he tweeted, “the bird is freed.” the bird is freed The closure of the deal ended a months-long, roller-coaster saga in which the billionaire — the world’s richest person — conducted a hostile takeover to buy Twitter at an inflated price, only to renege on the deal and then enter into a bitter legal battle with the social network. Elon Musk calls himself ‘Chief Twit,’ carries sink in visit to Twitter HQ But in recent days, Musk appeared resigned, and even enthusiastic, about his impending ownership. He showed up at the company’s offices unexpectedly Wednesday, carrying a sink to suggest that the message that he would become owner needed to “sink in,” according to a photo he posted to his more than 100 million Twitter followers. He also plans to hold a companywide town hall Friday. Twitter also is expected to become private Friday, dissolving its current board of directors and ending public trading of its stock. Neither Twitter nor the executives responded to requests for comment. Racist tweets quickly surfaced after Musk closed Twitter deal The moves place the heralded entrepreneur at the helm of one of the world’s most powerful communication platforms just days ahead of major elections in the United States and Brazil. Musk, a transportation magnate who is CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has offered some clues about what he would do when he took over Twitter — despite having no experience running a social media service. Elon Musk offers to buy Twitter for original price weeks before trial He has suggested that he wants to loosen standards for the policing of harmful content such as misinformation and hate speech. He has also decried so-called censorship by social media companies. Some right-wing influencers, who celebrated Musk’s ownership on Thursday night, have seen their follower counts balloon since he announced his takeover. “The bird is free, now free the GOAT,” tweeted Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), tagging @realdonaldtrump. The acronym stands for “greatest of all time.” The bird is free, now free the GOAT.@realDonaldTrump Musk has repeatedly criticized the company and supported online attacks against individual executives. He has told potential investors and partners that he wants to execute a financial turnaround of the company by firing nearly 75 percent of its workforce and leaning into new business opportunities, including having people subscribe to exclusive content from popular influencers on the service. Elon Musk says he would reverse ban on Donald Trump Musk represents a different kind of owner from Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey, or his now-rival Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, who generally try to stay politically neutral. Musk has announced that he would vote Republican in the 2022 midterms and was leaning toward voting for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) for president in 2024. He has also weighed in on geopolitical conflicts between China and Taiwan and on the Ukraine war. Inside Twitter, Musk’s arrival has been met with resentment and dismay — though his visit Wednesday left some hopeful. Those hopes were quickly dashed with the firings of longtime top executives, who had commanded the trust of existing staff. Musk’s interest in owning Twitter became public in early April, when financial filings revealed he had taken a more than 9 percent stake in the company, making him its largest individual shareholder. A day later, Musk was announced as Twitter’s newest board appointee. Texts reveal how Elon Musk was persuaded to buy Twitter But his relationship with top executives quickly went south. Agrawal took exception to Musk’s April 9 tweet that asked “Is Twitter dying?” according to text message exchanges revealed in court documents. Musk laid out his plan in subsequent messages. “I’m not joining the board,” he said in one. “This is a waste of time.” Instead, he decided to take Twitter private and went to the board with an ultimatum: let him buy the company or he would start a rival social media service. He publicly launched a hostile takeover bid, pricing the deal at $54.20 per share — which, in containing the number 420, was a possible wink to cannabis, raising some doubts about his sincerity. Roughly two weeks later, Musk and Twitter struck a deal. In an onstage interview, Musk discussed his plans. “Well I think it’s very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,” he said, echoing statements he has made over the past couple weeks. “Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have … both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law.” Why Elon Musk wants to buy Twitter But Twitter’s board — while angry at Musk’s tactics — was ultimately eager for the deal. Twitter executives were predicting internally that the company would be far off track from revenue targets in 2022, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post, as well as people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe proceedings. Twitter’s board was planning to make “drastic” cuts to staff and other services, including cutting roughly a quarter of the budget for third-party contractors who moderate content for the company, major cuts to infrastructure and data centers, and firing thousands of people to shave at least $700 million off labor costs, according to the interviews and documents. One of the leaders who signed off on the layoff notices was Edgett, who was fired Thursday. Executives also believed that the company would not have easily found other buyers, according to one of the people. Musk announced his acquisition three days before those layoffs were set to be announced, tabling the plans. He planned to buy the company with a combination of debt financing, co-investment and his own personal wealth, much of which is generated by his stake in Tesla. (Some of the financiers and firms that contributed large amounts of money to the deal, such as Sequoia Capital’s Doug Leone and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, are  active donors to Republican politics and known to be believers in a hands-off approach to free speech.) But the stock market started to collapse, affecting Tesla’s stock prices and Musk’s overall wealth. Musk declares Twitter deal on hold Musk then started tweeting about Twitter’s tabulation of spam and bots, which he argued understated the true proportion of nonhuman accounts on the site. That calculation mattered, Musk’s legal team would later argue, because it would mean that the number of users who saw ads was significantly lower than the 237.8 million daily active users eligible to see ads that the company counts in its quarterly reports. He declared the deal “on hold” in an early morning tweet May 13. By early July, Musk backed out of the deal completely. Twitter sued him days later, alleging breach of contract, sending the matter to the Delaware Court of Chancery. Musk’s chances were broadly viewed as grim, but his legal team latched on to a new strategy after The Post uncovered a whistleblower complaint that included explosive claims about Twitter’s business. Musk shifted his opinion on whether to buy the company after a series of losses in court in matters related to scheduling and discovery, according to people close to Musk and his team who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive matters. A loss became a serious possibility if the matter went to trial, risking penalties beyond merely the buying cost. And the blows to Tesla’s stock and Musk’s net worth became a lingering concern. Musk also took solace in his debt and equity commitments, which locked him in to the deal on favorable terms that might not be otherwise available, the people said. And he became excited by his plans for the site. Earlier this month, the Delaware judge overseeing the case agreed to let Twitter and Musk resolve their dispute by Friday, or it would go trial. The deal ultimately closed a day before that deadline."

Two top Twitter executives, ..."," Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time Elon Musk is now leading Twitter, according to CNBC.   Two top Twitter executives, CEO Parag Agrawal and Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal, were also out, CNBC reported.  Musk first made his $44 billion offer to acquire the social media platform in April, then sought to pull out of the deal weeks later over concerns about its volume of fake and spam accounts. Twitter ultimately sued Musk for breaching the original agreement, and Musk countersued, alleging fraud.  The two sides had been scheduled to meet in a Delaware courtroom this month to settle the dispute before Musk resubmitted his original $44 billion offer, without explanation.  Musk could not be reached for comment, but he said in a tweet late Thursday ""the bird is freed."" In a statement, Twitter said it planned to close the deal at the original agreed-upon price.  The deal promises to reshape a major forum for speech online just before the Nov. 8 midterm elections. Musk, from the start of his takeover bid, sketched out a vision for Twitter that includes looser rules for what people can say.  “We want to have the perception and the reality that speech is as free as possible,” he said at a conference in April.  The next month, Musk said he would reverse Donald Trump's permanent ban from the platform. The former president had earlier said he would not return and would instead remain on his Truth Social network.  Beyond those statements, Musk has not provided much detail about how he might rewrite Twitter’s rulebook, which prohibits posts that threaten violence, engage in targeted harassment or use hateful images or symbols. Looser rules could scare away some users and advertisers.  Musk vowed Thursday on Twitter to prevent the platform from becoming a ""free-for-all hellscape"" and to ""adhere to the laws of the land,"" while striving to make it “warm and welcoming to all.”   Users, he said, should be able to choose “your desired experience according to your preferences, just as you can choose, for example, to see movies or play video games ranging from all ages to mature.” Musk said he personally reached out to one high-profile celebrity, Ye, formerly Kanye West, this month to express concern about his comments attacking Jewish people.  But Musk has also said he wants to see more tweets from celebrities and other people with large followings on Twitter, some of whom have scaled back their use or switched to rival platforms, such as Instagram or TikTok. Reuters reported Tuesday that Twitter continues to lose its most active users.  Twitter shares rallied ahead of the deal announcement, reaching their highest level of the year Wednesday, at nearly $53, a market cap of nearly $41 billion. Twitter shareholders overwhelmingly voted last month to approve the deal.    Even as the agreement becomes official, it is raising concerns among Twitter employees about the future of the company. After The Washington Post reported that Musk plans to lay off as much as 75% of Twitter's staff, a group of workers signed a letter saying the layoffs would “hurt Twitter’s ability to serve the public conversation.”  “A threat of this magnitude is reckless, undermines our users’ and customers’ trust in our platform, and is a transparent act of worker intimidation,"" they said. The company's general counsel sought to reassure employees by calling reports of the alleged plan for layoffs ""rumors."" Rob Wile is a breaking business news reporter for NBC News Digital.

Home  News  Elon Musk Rockets Weight-Loss Drug Into Public Eye
 back to News   minute read
         Prescription drugs for diabetes are being touted by some celebrities and other social media influencers as quick ways to shed weight. A CU Anschutz expert on obesity and weight-loss strategies explains the pros and cons of these injectable drugs. When a Twitter follower praised Elon Musk’s new “awesome, fit, ripped and healthy” look, the billionaire entrepreneur replied that his secret was “fasting” and “Wegovy.” Given society’s obsession with celebrities and weight loss and Musk’s massive following on Twitter, a viral tweet was born. Increasingly, Wegovy, Ozempic and other diabetic drugs are being touted by influencers on social media as fast ways to lose weight. The injectable drugs come with a steep price tag, costing as much as $1,000 a month. Below, Adam Gilden, MD, MSCE, associate director of the University of Colorado Weight Management and Wellness Clinic at the CU Anschutz Health and Wellness Center, talks about these drugs. In his practice, Gilden, an associate professor of internal medicine at the CU School of Medicine, focuses on helping patients lose weight, especially those with conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, high cholesterol and arthritis.  
We call these drugs GLP-1s because that’s the hormone they act on. The first GLP-1 medication, exenatide (Byetta), was FDA approved in 2005 for treatment of type 2 diabetes. There are now two medicines in the class that are FDA approved for chronic weight management, in addition to diabetes. One is liraglutide, which has a diabetes dose and a higher weight-loss dose. And there is semaglutide (including Wegovy and Ozempic), which has the same separate doses for either diabetes or weight loss. Semaglutide has received more attention in the press because it’s nearly twice as effective as liraglutide in terms of the average weight loss.   
Yes, the FDA approval for weight loss medicines is the same for all medicines, which is a body mass index of 30, or a body mass index of 27 if the person has a significant secondary weight-related condition like diabetes, high blood pressure or sleep apnea. These medicines are meant to be used on a long-term basis, so we don’t prescribe them for six months and then stop, because typically the patient would regain their weight. So, we typically keep people on these medicines for years.   
There have been some supply chain issues with production of the injection pens used for the weight-loss doses of semaglutide (Wegovy). That has had some spillover effect for the diabetes pens (Ozempic). However, I don’t think the shortage is widespread enough to be a real health risk to patients with diabetes.   
For weight loss, the mechanism is that it slows the emptying of the stomach. So, people just tend to feel full very quickly on these medicines and eat much smaller portions. There are also some secondary effects in the brain in terms of reducing the drive to eat.   
GLP stands for glucagon-like peptide, so it’s a hormone that’s produced by the pancreas at the same time insulin is produced, and it suppresses the secretion of glucagon, which is a hormone that raises blood sugar. It is a naturally occurring pancreatic hormone that has the effect of lowering the blood sugar.   
Serious side effects from these medicines, such as pancreas inflammation, are rare. The most common side effects are intestinal and are related to the mechanism of slowing the emptying of the stomach. So, nausea is the most common side effect, along with bloating and changes in bowel habits.   
The term ‘fasting’ is often misused in the general parlance. For most patients, what they’re talking about is restricting the number of hours per day that they eat. In the field we call that ‘time-restricted eating.’ The science supporting this practice is, frankly, not very strong. There was a recent article published that showed that it did seem to produce maybe four or five pounds more of weight loss compared to the usual advice that we give patients, but as I remember, the participants in that study have to stop eating by a pretty early hour in the evening. So, one of the major restrictions of time-restricted eating is, to be an effective strategy, that person has to stop eating by early evening, and it’s just a very difficult strategy to implement for most people who work full time. So, somehow this strategy of time-restricted eating has become very popular in the U.S. without much science behind it. If patients ask me about what they call ‘fasting,’ I’m going to tell them, ‘Yes, it’s fine if you want to try that, but there’s nothing magical about it.’ The most important number is the total number of calories consumed per day, rather than the number of hours per day that a person eats.   
That’s a great question because it gets to many other issues including why health plans typically don’t pay for (the drugs). Because if you look at the national data on obesity, 40% of the American public could potentially be eligible to take a medicine like this. When you look at the cost of these medicines and the large number of people eligible to take them, it’s obviously not sustainable from a health system perspective. So, do I encourage people to take a medicine? I try not to push people one way or the other. My patients are generally seeking advice and help, and often times, they are looking for something more than dietary advice. My practice is to tell them about the available medication options – including how much weight they might expect to lose – and that they are probably going to have to take a medicine long term, and that it may or may not be covered by their insurance. At the same time, I tell them about the science of body weight regulation, which is that if somebody loses 10% of their body weight their energy needs actually go down by 15% rather than 10%. So, when a person loses weight the body becomes more efficient at storing energy, which then predisposes them to regain their weight. So, the idea that people regain the weight because they revert to their previous eating and exercise patterns, this does not tell the whole story. There are biological reasons why people have trouble sustaining a long-term plan that allows them to lose weight and keep it off. There are reductions in metabolism and increases in hunger that predispose people to regaining their weight. So, for those reasons, medications can sometimes be very helpful, but I try not to push people into taking pills. The medication is meant to be a tool to help the patient make dietary modifications that can be permanent.   
Diabetes is one of the biggest risks. Sleep apnea is also very closely connected to weight and is a pretty significant health issue. We also see high blood pressure and high cholesterol, but those are pretty easy to treat compared to diabetes and sleep apnea. As people age, we see the musculoskeletal complications of excessive weight. We see knee arthritis and hip arthritis – and similar conditions – which can become debilitating.

Musk, who is CEO of automaker Tesla and reusable rocket maker SpaceX, completed the $44 billion acquisition of Twitter on Oct. 28 and made his mark there immediately. He fired the company's CEO, chief financial officer, policy and legal team leaders right away, and has also dissolved Twitter's board of directors. According to internal records viewed by CNBC, employees from Musk's other companies are now authorized to work at Twitter, including more than 50 from Tesla, two from the Boring Company (which is building underground tunnels) and one from Neuralink (which is developing a brain-computer interface). Some of Musk's friends, advisors and backers, including the head of his family office Jared Birchall, angel investor Jason Calacanis, and founding PayPal chief operating officer and venture capitalist David Sacks, are also involved. So are two people who share Musk's last name, James and Andrew Musk, who have worked at Palantir and Neuralink, respectively. Among the dozens who Elon Musk enlisted specifically from Tesla are: director of software development Ashok Elluswamy, director of Autopilot and TeslaBot engineering Milan Kovac, senior director of software engineering Maha Virduhagiri; Pete Scheutzow, a senior staff technical program manager, and Jake Nocon, who is part of Tesla's surveillance unit, as a senior manager of security intelligence. Nocon previously worked for Uber and Nisos, a security company that had a multimillion-dollar contract with Tesla to identify insider threats, and monitor critics of the company. At Twitter, Musk is counting on his lieutenants and loyalists to decide who and what to cut or keep at the social network. He is also pressing them to learn everything they can about Twitter as quickly as possible, from source code to content moderation and data-privacy requirements, so he can redesign the platform, several Twitter employees told CNBC over the weekend. How to play a possible global electric vehicle meltdown, according to Deutsche Bank These are the biggest stock shorts out there — including a big bet against this EV maker Goldman names global winners and losers from sliding battery prices; gives one 120% upside    Musk has billed himself as a free speech absolutist, but he has to balance those wishes with laws and business realities. He said in an open letter to advertisers last week as he was taking over the company: ""Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences."" It is not immediately clear how Tesla employees are expected to split their schedules between the automaker and Twitter. Typically, when Tesla employees work for other Elon Musk ventures, usually SpaceX or the Boring Company, they can get paid by the other venture as a consultant. Some of Musk's employees have full-time roles at more than one of his businesses. For example, Tesla Vice President of Materials Charlie Kuehmann, is concurrently a vice president at SpaceX. At other times, two Tesla employees told CNBC, workers at the electric automaker are pressured to help with projects at his other companies for no additional pay because it's seen as good for their careers, or because the work is regarded as helping with a related party transaction or project. Tesla is facing serious scrutiny around the technology built and maintained by its Autopilot team, namely its driver-assistance systems, which are marketed as Autopilot, FSD and FSD Beta. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and the California Department of Motor Vehicles are all investigating whether Tesla or Musk violated laws and misled consumers about Tesla's driver assistance systems, which are still in development and do not make the company's cars self-driving. Meanwhile, the federal vehicle safety authority, NHTSA, continues to investigate whether Tesla driver assistance systems may have contained defects that contributed to or caused collisions. The way that Tesla marketed these systems on social media, including Twitter, is part of the scope of at least one NHTSA investigation. Several Twitter employees told CNBC over the weekend that Tesla employees now at Twitter have been involved in code review at the social network, even though their skills from working on Autopilot and other Tesla software and hardware do not directly overlap with the languages and systems used to build and maintain the social network. These employees asked not to be named because they're not authorized to talk to the press about internal matters, and feared retaliation. For example, most engineers in automotive companies, even the tech-forward Tesla, do not have experience designing and operating search engines and platforms that are broadly accessible to the public. Twitter has multiple code bases with millions of lines of code in each, and myriad 10 million or even 100 million or more queries per second (QPS) systems underpinning it. At Tesla, Python is one of the preferred scripting languages, and at Twitter programmers have used Scala extensively. Twitter also has more exposure to international regulations around hate speech and data privacy, for example, particularly the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. Twitter employees who were there before Musk took over said they have been asked to show his teams all manner of technical documentation, to justify their work and their teams' work, and to explain their value within the company. The threat of dismissal looms if they do not impress, they said. The employees said they are worried about being fired without cause or warning, rather than laid off with severance. Some are worried that they will not be able to reap the rewards of stock options that are scheduled to vest in the first week of November, according to documentation viewed by CNBC. Meanwhile, the Twitter employees said they have not received specific plans from Musk and his team yet, and are largely in the dark about possible head count cuts within their groups, budgets and long-term strategies. Musk has set nearly impossible deadlines for some to do-list items, however. One immediate project is to redesign the company's subscription software, dubbed Twitter Blue, and the company's verification system (known sometimes as ""blue checks"" for the way they are denoted on the service). Employees say Musk wants that work done by the first week of November. The Verge previously reported that Musk wants to charge $20 per user per month, and to only give verification marks to the accounts of users who are paid subscribers, and would remove verification from accounts who do not pay for Twitter Blue. Managers at Twitter have instructed some employees to work 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, in order to hit Musk's aggressive deadlines, according to internal communications. The sprint orders have come without any discussion about overtime pay or comp time, or about job security. Task completion by the early November deadline is seen as a make-or-break matter for their careers at Twitter. In an atmosphere of fear and distrust, many Twitter employees have stopped communicating with each other on internal systems about workplace issues. What's more, some of Twitter's Slack channels have gone nearly silent, multiple employees told CNBC. Meanwhile, Musk and his inner circle have been plumbing archived messages in the systems, ostensibly looking for people to fire and budgets or projects to slash. On Sunday night, in a display of his unfettered access to internal information at the company, CEO Elon Musk (who calls himself ""Chief Twit"" but is officially CEO and sole director) posted a screenshot to his 112 million listed followers on Twitter. The screenshot depicted comments made by Twitter's head of safety and integrity, Yoel Roth, in May 2022. At the time, Musk was trying to get out of his agreement to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share. In court, and in public, Musk had vociferously accused Twitter of faking metrics, specifically of playing down the amount of spam, fake accounts and harmful bots that exist on the platform. In the internal message that Musk made public, Roth wrote disparagingly of a person involved with the business named Amir, and also remarked, that if Amir continued to ""BS"" him or others about objectives and key results, Twitter would be ""literally doing what Elon is accusing us of doing."" Musk alleged in a tweet that, ""Wachtell & Twitter board deliberately hid this evidence from the court."" He also appeared to threaten further legal action, writing: ""Stay tuned, more to come..."" Representatives for Twitter, Tesla and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz have yet to respond to requests for comment.

Vittoria Elliott After months spent trying to undo the deal he initiated, Tesla founder Elon Musk will pay $44 billion to take ownership of Twitter, honoring an agreement made in April. The news was confirmed this morning by the US Securities and Exchange Commission after a day of high drama at Twitter.  Late yesterday, The Washington Post reported that several top executives had been fired, including CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, chief counsel Sean Edgett, and policy chief Vijaya Gadde, who Musk has suggested caused the platform to favor liberal political views. Reuters reported that the executives were escorted from Twitter’s San Francisco HQ.  Musk changed his bio to read “Chief Twit” and tweeted: “the bird is freed.” Twitter cofounder Biz Stone thanked the three executives for their “collective contribution” to the social network. Later, Segal updated his bio to “former CFO and current fan” of Twitter.The deal completes Musk’s metamorphosis from Twitter super user, to vocal critic, to owner. The platform and the company behind it appear to be set for major changes. The entrepreneur has said he would allow former US president Donald Trump back onto the platform and accused Twitter’s moderation policies of causing a perception of liberal bias. In text messages released during his attempt to get out of the deal, Musk discussed staff cuts. Musk first offered to buy Twitter in April after purchasing some 10 percent of the company’s shares and attempting and then declining to join its board. Twitter’s board initially moved to resist a takeover, but later in the month announced that it had accepted Musk’s offer to purchase the company for $44 billion, in a deal including a $1 billion termination fee should either party choose to walk away. Almost immediately, the company lost some of its top talent. Musk made clear he wanted major changes at Twitter, which despite its cultural clout in politics and media has lagged behind other social networks in scale and profitability. Musk said he was concerned about political bias and wanted to see Twitter support “free speech” by restricting only posts that broke the law, a policy that in the US would allow hate speech and other content currently banned. Activists, company insiders, and some minority shareholders began to worry that Twitter under Musk would become a haven for trolls and harassment. Angela Watercutter Andy Greenberg Gregory Barber Garrett M. Graff Gadde, who led Twitter’s work on moderation, was pummeled with online abuse after Musk tweeted a meme featuring her image that implied she caused the platform’s content moderation to favor liberal views. (Twitter’s own research has indicated that the platform in fact favors right-wing politicians and media outlets). Musk’s ardor for Twitter faded weeks after the deal was agreed, in the wake of a broad selloff on the stock market. The entrepreneur claimed that the deal was “temporarily on hold,” alleging that the company had lied about the number of bots in figures disclosed in financial filings. In response, Twitter sued Musk to force him to close the sale. The dispute led Musk to accuse Twitter of fraud in an August legal filing, in an effort to walk away from the deal. As the legal drama continued and Musk regularly criticized the company, its stock price fell, making the deal he had agreed look still worse. Musk eventually reversed himself again, announcing weeks before a trial in Delaware’s Chancery Court that he would buy Twitter after all. That twist did not surprise legal experts, who saw that nearly every way for him to wriggle out of the purchase was closed off. Final negotiations between Twitter and Musk continued behind closed doors until this week. On Wednesday, Musk appeared at the company’s San Francisco headquarters, inexplicably carrying a sink. Yesterday, he tweeted a message to Twitter’s advertisers, saying he was buying the platform to “help humanity,” and believed it was “important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square.” Hours later, news broke that CEO Agrawal and others had been fired as Musk’s takeover had begun. As the news spread across the platform, some users discussed moving to alternative services, such as Mastodon. Musk seemed distracted, tweeting an image of a rocket launch by his company SpaceX. 📨 Make the most of chatbots with our AI Unlocked newsletter Taylor Swift, Star Wars, Stranger Things, and Deadpool have one man in common Generative AI is playing a surprising role in Israel-Hamas disinformation The new era of social media looks as bad for privacy as the last one Johnny Cash’s Taylor Swift cover predicts the boring future of AI music Your internet browser does not belong to you 🔌 Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters, power banks, and USB hubs Reece Rogers Brandi Collins-Dexter Matt Reynolds Morgan Meaker Khari Johnson Morgan Meaker Vittoria Elliott Amanda Hoover More From WIRED Contact © 2023 Condé Nast.

Elon Musk (and his consortium of much smaller investors) now owns Twitter. We need to take seriously the possibility that this will end up being one of the funniest things that’s ever happened. Tesla CEO Elon Musk in Stavanger, Norway, on Aug. 29, 2022. That’s because as of this moment, it looks like Musk dug a big hole in the forest, carefully filled it with punji sticks and crocodiles, and then jumped in. This was made immediately clear by Musk’s “Dear Twitter Advertisers” tweet as the deal closed:  Dear Twitter Advertisers pic.twitter.com/GMwHmInPAS — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 27, 2022  The statement starts off, promisingly, with a blatant lie: “The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important for the future of civilization to have a common digital town square.” Musk apparently believes that no one will remember that until three weeks ago, he was desperately trying not to buy Twitter. The only reason he did is because he was about to lose Twitter’s lawsuit to force him to buy it. This may be the greatest “you can’t fire me because I quit” moment in history. The significance of the rest of his statement is more subtle. To understand it, you have to start with the basics. Twitter currently makes 90 percent of its revenue from advertising. (The rest is largely from data licensing.) This means that you, the Twitter user, are not Twitter’s customers. You are its product. Its customers are corporate advertisers and, as every businessperson knows, the customer is always right. Grocery stores care about the people shopping for Cheetos, not about the feelings of the Cheetos themselves. Twitter’s content moderation has sometimes been heavy-handed — especially when it froze my account because David Duke got mad at me. But this is not because Twitter is run by a woke mob. It’s because Twitter needs to keep advertisers happy — and their top priority is a certain kind of environment for their ads. This can take specific forms. Delta probably has it written into its contract that its ads won’t run near any tweets about plane crashes. But more generally, advertisers don’t want anything controversial that gets people out of the buying mood, or worse, mad at the brands themselves. Proctor & Gamble can’t allow its ads for Charmin, targeted at the Upscale Panera Mom micro-demographic, to appear below frothing diatribes about annihilating all Muslims. Twitter is also, speaking just in financial terms, a crummy business. It’s only been profitable for two years of its existence, 2018 and 2019. In 2020 it lost over $1 billion, rebounding to lose a mere $222 million in 2021. To make matters worse, Musk’s deal to buy Twitter involved taking out $12.5 billion in loans. This means that Twitter will have to come up with an additional $1 billion a year to service this debt. Thus if Twitter simply continues on its current path, it will lose huge amounts of money indefinitely. But if advertisers get nervous about Musk’s management and flee the platform, it could see losses every year in the multiple billions of dollars. It’s true that Musk has said, “I don’t care about the economics at all.” But even as the richest man on earth, he has to care about them. He has a current estimated net worth of $220 billion, but that’s not $220 billion in cash sitting in a bank vault — it’s mostly tied up in his stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. Thus to cover big Twitter losses, he would have to sell off more of his stock every year. This would be painful in monetary terms but more so in terms of power: Eventually he would get into a situation in which he could lose control of the companies, Tesla in particular. Moreover, Tesla is publicly traded, and while it’s fallen 45 percent since its high a year ago, it remains way overvalued by normal metrics. Right now its price-earnings ratio is 70. The historical average for the S&P 500 is about 15. The price-earnings ratio for both Ford and GM right now is 6. This is why Musk hit the ground running with a groveling attempt to propitiate advertisers. He absolutely must keep them happy. As he put it, “Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise.” And that’s where the hilarity begins. Musk has engaged in endless paeans to the glory of free speech and the need to end Twitter’s invidious censorship. This clearly isn’t a subject he’s thought deeply about, since he said back in May that Twitter should delete “tweets that are wrong and bad.” Still, his vague pronouncements have given him a legion of right-wing acolytes who feel they’ve been ill-treated by Twitter. But they are not Musk’s constituency now. Advertisers are. Even if Musk had some genuine commitment to free speech (which he absolutely does not), it would be essentially impossible for him not to continue significant content moderation. That’s why, after a brief nod to his wish for Twitter to be a place “where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner,” he quickly pivoted to telling advertisers that “Twitter obviously cannot be a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences! In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all.” This could have been the mission statement of pre-Musk Twitter. But now there’s one big difference: When the content moderation of Twitter remains largely the same, the sense of betrayal among Musk’s super-fans will explode with the force of a supernova. And they will scream at Musk about it nonstop — on Twitter. Another mogul might have the fortitude to ignore this. But Musk does not, judging by past performance. You can also judge this by current performance: On his first full day on the job, Musk is personally “digging in” to the complaints of Catturd ™.  I will be digging in more today — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 28, 2022  And while Musk has announced a new “content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints,” he will feel constantly compelled to either explain why he’s standing by his underlings’ moderation decisions, or reverse them. Then he will inevitably be drawn into personally making more and more content calls, perhaps giving the thumbs up or thumbs down to individual tweets. It will be hell on earth for him. No matter what decisions he makes, he will infuriate large swaths of Twitter. The left will see its suspicions about him confirmed. The right will see him as a horrendous sellout, just another lying Big Tech swine. Joe Rogan will shake his head sadly about what happened to Elon. Eventually what used to give Musk the greatest pleasure, opening up Twitter on his phone, will be a source of excruciating pain. And that’s just the beginning. Musk has important business interests around the world, and the potential riptides are endless. What happens when Kim Kardashian starts tweeting about how Taiwan is an independent country? Will the government of China quietly suggest to Musk that he do something about this, or will they make things hard for Tesla’s Shanghai plant and block the import of Teslas? What do other Tesla shareholders do if he defies China, and they find out his little bird app adventure is losing them money? What happens when a SpaceX rocket explodes, but Musk has been too busy adjudicating which Nazi furries are going to be suspended for a month? This future is obviously not foreordained. Possibly Musk will do what no human has ever been able to do before and invent 1) content moderation that everyone likes at an enormous scale, and 2) a way to make huge amounts of money off Twitter. Maybe Tesla will become so profitable that he can use it to subsidize Twitter until 2090. But the most likely outcome is that he’s just asked the monkey’s paw to grant him his greatest wish. Now look as the paw crooks its gnarled finger, and Musk’s love for Twitter ends up obliterating the Twitter experience for one specific user: Elon Musk.

Link Copied It’s been nearly eight months since Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops and tanks over the border into Ukraine, and a lot has changed in that time. Ukraine has shown itself to be a far more robust military force than pretty much anyone predicted. Talk has changed from wondering how long Ukraine could hold out to how much territory it can retake — and to when and how the war will end. But it’s still hard to imagine how Putin’s war on Ukraine will conclude. Does Putin even have an endgame? If he really wants to control Ukrainian territory, why does he seem so bent on destroying it? To get insights into these questions, I reached out to Fiona Hill, one of America’s most clear-eyed observers of Russia and Putin, who served as an adviser to former President Donald Trump and gained fame for her testimony in his first impeachment trial. In the early days of Russia’s war on Ukraine, Hill warned in an interview with POLITICO that what Putin was trying to do was not only seize Ukraine but destroy the current world order. And she recognized from the start that Putin would use the threat of nuclear conflict to try to get his way. Now, despite the setbacks Russia has suffered on the battlefield, Hill thinks Putin is undaunted. She sees him adapting to new conditions, not giving up. And she sees him trying to get the West to accede to his aims by using messengers like billionaire Elon Musk to propose arrangements that would end the conflict on his terms. “Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they’re just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin,” Hill says. But while Putin appears to be doubling down in Ukraine, the conflict poses some real dangers to his leadership. He has identified himself quite directly with the war, Hill notes, and he can’t afford to look like a loser. If he begins to lose support from Russian elites, his hold on power could slip. The West has come a long way since February in understanding the stakes in Ukraine, Hill says, but the world still hasn’t totally grasped the full challenge Putin is posing. Putin must be contained, Hill says, but that won’t happen unless and until international institutions established in the wake of World War II evolve so they can contain him. And that conversation is only just beginning. “This is a great power conflict, the third great power conflict in the European space in a little over a century,” Hill says. “It’s the end of the existing world order. Our world is not going to be the same as it was before.” This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.  Reynolds: The war clearly hasn’t gone as Putin originally intended. How has Putin reacted to his setbacks and how do you think his mindset is evolving? Hill: Whenever he has a setback, Putin figures he can get out of it, that he can turn things around. That’s partly because of his training as a KGB operative. In the past, when asked about the success of operations, he’s pooh-poohed the idea that operations always go as planned, that everything is always perfect. He says there are always problems in an operation, there are always setbacks. Sometimes they’re absolute disasters. The key is adaptation. Another hallmark of Putin is that he doubles down. He always takes the more extreme step in his range of options, the one that actually cuts off other alternatives. Putin has often related an experience he had as a kid, when he trapped a rat in a corner in the apartment building he lived in, in Leningrad, and the rat shocked him by jumping out and fighting back. He tells this story as if it’s a story about himself, that if he’s ever cornered, he will always fight back. But he’s also the person who puts himself in the corner. We know that the Russians have had very high casualties and that they’ve been running out of manpower and equipment in Ukraine. The casualty rate on the Russian side keeps mounting. A few months ago, estimates were 50,000. Now the suggestions are 90,000 killed or severely injured. This is a real blow given the 170,000 Russia troops deployed to the Ukrainian border when the invasion began. So, what does Putin do? He sends even more troops in by launching a full-on mobilization. He still hasn’t said this is a war. It remains a “special military operation,” but he calls up 300,000 people. Then, he goes several steps further and announces the annexation of the territories that Russia has been fighting over for the last several months, not just Donetsk and Luhansk, but also the territories of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Putin gives himself no way out except to pursue the original goals he had when he went in, which is the dismemberment of Ukraine and Russia annexing its territory. And he’s still trying to adapt his responses to setbacks on the battlefield.

Reynolds: At this point, if he’s so adaptive, do you think he has an endgame? Hill: In his mind, I think Putin still thinks he’s got more game to play. His endgame is to go out of this war on his terms. What we’re seeing right now, with the annexations and the big speech that he made on September 30th is very clear. He sees this conflict as a full-on war with the West, and he still is adamant on removing Ukraine from the map and from global affairs. It’s also clear that he has no intention whatsoever of giving up Donetsk and Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, as well as Crimea, which he’s already taken and already declared as part of Russia for time immemorial. Reynolds: Why does Putin want all that territory? Does he want the symbolism of having restored an important part of the Russian Empire, reestablishing this mythological Novorossiya, taking back lands that Russia seized from the Ottoman Empire? Or does he really want to rule this part of modern-day Ukraine in concrete, practical ways? Hill: It’s actually both of those things. They are inextricably linked. You mentioned this idea of Novorossiya, “New Russia.” I think most people have forgotten that he used this term in 2014. Back then, the Kremlin triggered the war in Donbas as part of an effort to regain control of the territories of Novorossiya that were first annexed from the Ottoman Empire by Catherine the Great back in the late 18th century. There wasn’t really a lot of settlement there then, and that’s how we got Potemkin villages — Prince Grigory Potemkin took Catherine on a carriage ride through her new dominion and they created fake villages, with peasants brought in to wave at the empress as she went by. We have this same issue now — what and who is Putin presiding over? Even Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s press secretary, recently admitted that Russia hasn’t quite worked out the borders of the annexed areas yet, because the Ukrainians have been pushing back. The question of what Russia actually controls beyond all the symbolism of annexation is still a major question. Reynolds: If Putin wants Ukrainian territory so badly, why is he raining down such destruction on civilian areas and committing so many human rights abuses in occupied areas? Hill: This is punishment, but also perverse redevelopment. You cow people into submission, destroy what they had and all their links to their past and their old lives, and then make them into something new and, thus, yours. Destroy Ukraine and Ukrainians. Build New Russia and create Russians. Its brutal but also a hallmark of imperial conquest. Reynolds: And it’s how they did it in the 18th century. Hill: Exactly. Putin would love to control the territory. But control involves actually having people on your side. And that is really a big question. We’ve seen in all of these territories, Russia shipping people out or detaining them, from entire families and children to teachers, administrators and local police, and then proxy citizens sent in from Russia itself. Putin’s initial goal when he launched the invasion was the collapse of central Ukrainian authority, the imposition of a puppet government in Kyiv, and all local governments swearing allegiance to Moscow, probably with some political commissar-type proxy leaders put in place around the country — the kind of thing that we saw happening in 2014 in the Russian-occupied territories of Donetsk and Lugansk and Crimea. But of course, that didn’t happen. So the problem that Putin has is controlling people in these territories rather than playing his own version of Potemkin villages. Reynolds: We’ve recently had Elon Musk step into this conflict trying to promote discussion of peace settlements. What do you make of the role that he’s playing? Hill: It’s very clear that Elon Musk is transmitting a message for Putin. There was a conference in Aspen in late September when Musk offered a version of what was in his tweet — including the recognition of Crimea as Russian because it’s been mostly Russian since the 1780s — and the suggestion that the Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia should be up for negotiation, because there should be guaranteed water supplies to Crimea. He made this suggestion before Putin’s annexation of those two territories on September 30. It was a very specific reference. Kherson and Zaporizhzhia essentially control all the water supplies to Crimea. Crimea is a dry peninsula. It has aquifers, but it doesn’t have rivers. It’s dependent on water from the Dnipro River that flows through a canal from Kherson. It’s unlikely Elon Musk knows about this himself. The reference to water is so specific that this clearly is a message from Putin. Now, there are several reasons why Musk’s intervention is interesting and significant. First of all, Putin does this frequently. He uses prominent people as intermediaries to feel out the general political environment, to basically test how people are going to react to ideas. Henry Kissinger, for example, has had interactions with Putin directly and relayed messages. Putin often uses various trusted intermediaries including all kinds of businesspeople. I had intermediaries sent to discuss things with me while I was in government. This is a classic Putin play. It’s just fascinating, of course, that it’s Elon Musk in this instance, because obviously Elon Musk has a huge Twitter following. He’s got a longstanding reputation in Russia through Tesla, the SpaceX space programs and also through Starlink. He’s one of the most popular men in opinion polls in Russia. At the same time, he’s played a very important part in supporting Ukraine by providing Starlink internet systems to Ukraine, and kept telecommunications going in Ukraine, paid for in part by the U.S. government. Elon Musk has enormous leverage as well as incredible prominence. Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they’re just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin. Reynolds: Putin is very comfortable dealing with billionaires and oligarchs. That’s a world that he knows well. But by using Musk this way, he goes right over the heads of [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian government. Hill: He is basically short-circuiting the diplomatic process. He wants to lay out his terms and see how many people are going to pick them up. All of this is an effort to get Americans to take themselves out of the war and hand over Ukraine and Ukrainian territory to Russia.

Reynolds: You have compared Putin’s invasion of Ukraine to Hitler’s invasions of other countries in World War II, of Czechoslovakia, of Poland. Do you still see it that way? Do you think that Putin has become Hitler-like in how he thinks of himself and how he seeks territory? Hill: Yes, but also like Kaiser Wilhelm in World War I as well. Look, exactly 100 years before Putin annexed Crimea in 2014, in 1914, the Germans invaded Belgium and France and World War I was fought as a Great Power conflict to eject Germany from Belgium and France. And World War II in Europe, of course, was a refighting territorially of many of the outcomes of World War I. Part of the problem is that conceptually, people have a hard time with the idea of a world war. It brings all kinds of horrors to mind — the Holocaust and the detonation of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the dawning of the nuclear age. But if you think about it, a world war is a great power conflict over territory which overturns the existing international order and where other states find themselves on different sides of the conflict. It involves economic warfare, information warfare, as well as kinetic war. We’re in the same situation. Again, Putin invaded Ukraine in 2014, exactly 100 years after Germany invaded Belgium and France — and just in the same way that Hitler seized the Sudetenland, annexed Austria and invaded Poland. We’re having a hard time coming to terms with what we’re dealing with here. This is a great power conflict, the third great power conflict in the European space in a little over a century. It’s the end of the existing world order. Our world is not going to be the same as it was before. People worry about this being dangerous hyperbole. But we have to really accept what the situation is to be able to respond appropriately. Each war has been fought differently. Modern wars involve information space and cyberspace, and we’ve seen all of these at play here. And, in the 21st century, these are economic and financial wars. We’re all-in on the financial and economic side of things. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has turned global energy and food security on its head because of the way Russia is leveraging gas and oil and the blockade Putin has imposed in the Black Sea against Ukrainian grain exports. Russia has not just targeted Ukrainian agricultural production, as well as port facilities for exporting grain, but caused a global food crisis. These are global effects of what is very clearly not just a regional war. Keep in mind that Putin himself has used the language of both world wars. He’s talked about the fact that Ukraine did not exist as a state until after World War I, after the dissolution of the Russian Empire and the creation of the Soviet Union. He has blamed the early Soviets for the formation of what he calls an artificial state. Right from the very beginning, Putin himself has said that he is refighting World War II. So, the hyperbole has come from Vladimir Putin, who has said that he’s reversing all of the outcomes territorially from World War I and also, in effect, World War II and the Cold War. He’s not accepting the territorial configuration of Europe as it currently is. What we have to figure out now is, how are we going to contend with this? Reynolds: China and India, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi, and other world leaders who have not exactly been with West on this — how do you think their views of what Russia is doing is changing? Hill: This is another global dimension. Just before the invasion, at the Beijing Olympics, we had Xi Jinping and Putin standing in seeming solidarity, talking about a limitless partnership, and Xi Jinping being very explicit in terms of Chinese opposition to the expansion of NATO and the role of NATO in the world. Clearly, at that point, Xi and China didn’t expect that Vladimir Putin’s special military operation would turn into the largest military action in Europe since World War II. Now, Xi Jinping is leery about showing any kind of diminution of his support for Vladimir Putin and Russia, since that would suggest he made a major miscalculation in lending Putin support. We haven’t seen Xi repudiating Putin and Russia directly. But we’ve certainly seen some signs of concern. At a meeting in Central Asia around the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Putin himself acknowledged that China had concerns. We’re pretty sure at this point that the Chinese also don’t like Vladimir Putin’s nuclear saber rattling in the context of the war in Ukraine, because that destabilizes the larger strategic balance globally, not just in Europe. For India, this has been a nightmare, frankly, and they’ve been trying to straddle the fence and figure out a balance. They don’t want to get on the wrong side of the United States or Ukraine, or Russia, and they just don’t really know quite what to do. Nonetheless, Prime Minister Modi has said explicitly to Putin, look, this is a time for peace, not war. And being much more outspoken on the issue of the conflict than perhaps some might have anticipated. That’s not insignificant. Once we get past the party Congress in China, we should watch how the Chinese-Russian relationship plays out. China would be instrumental in signaling to Putin how far he can go in terms of pursuing his endgame. Reynolds: Let’s talk about the situation inside Russia. Do you think Putin was surprised by the wave of protests that followed his announcement of what he called a partial mobilization? Or was he expecting that? Hill: Yes, he was expecting pushback which is why he called it partial when it’s really a stealth full mobilization. The goal is to try to get the military up to full strength and get everybody he possibly can. The problem is that all these new forces are not battle ready. Many have had minimal military training. It’s very clear that most of them are going to be used as cannon fodder. Putin’s responding not just to the setbacks on the battlefield, but to setbacks in the information war in the domestic arena. He’s getting pushback from the party of war. We have to remember there were nationalists since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s who wanted to retake Ukraine, not just Crimea, and reabsorb all the Russian-speaking territories. People in the cohort around Putin have pushed the invasion of Ukraine for some considerable period of time, and he has to keep them on his side. They are not satisfied. They want Ukraine dismembered. The shock, perhaps, is how many Russians have fled the mobilization. Although Russian authorities have been going to the borders to forcibly conscript people lining up to leave, they still haven’t taken the step of closing all the borders off. Putin and the Kremlin are aware that they would get a massive backlash if they did. We’ve already seen violence in Dagestan and other places where ethnic minorities have borne the brunt of recruitment. I think they are very, very aware that they’ve got to leave a safety valve open because otherwise there might be more protests, and more violence in response to the mobilization. Reynolds: If there are more protests and more violence, does that pose a threat to Putin as leader? How weak or vulnerable is Putin’s position right now? Hill: Back to the Soviet period, there were tens of thousands of violent protests across the Soviet Union over the years. This didn’t lead to the disintegration of the Soviet Union because of severe repression. It was something messy they had to deal with. They decapitated the opposition, and that’s what Putin’s done. Russia is back to the USSR. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny is in isolation in a penal colony. The repressive capacity of the government is pretty significant. They’ve been taking thousands of people off the streets and putting them in jail. I think Putin feels he can decapitate any organized opposition. He has to just be careful to control the sheer number of opposition protests, which is, again, why they’re keeping the safety valves open. Putin knows Russian history. World War I did lead to mass protests. The defeat in the Russo-Japanese War earlier in the 1900s also led to mass protests that got out of hand and discredited the czarist system. All of this could discredit him. So, there is some real risk. What he’s making sure of is that there’s no one who could lead these protests and make them coalesce. If you think back to when Navalny was poisoned in 2020, he was out in the Urals region and Siberia, pulling together opposition groups at a time when there were many protests going on in Russia. He was poisoned because he was getting some traction. Nonetheless, the mobilization chips away at Putin’s popularity because people feel that they’ve got no hope. They’re no longer able to watch the war on their TV screens and switch it off and forget it’s happening. They’re forced to confront it. Support for the war was already fairly passive, but active support for the war is declining and support for Putin himself will decline as well. And he’s got to keep placating the hardliners. So, he’s got to take extreme actions. You’re going to start hearing more and more stories of people who’ve gone to the front completely unprepared and got killed. That will reduce tolerance for the special military operation. If that happens, it could impact Putin’s standing among the elite. He’s been pretty much unassailable as long as he’s been the only really truly popular politician in Russia. But if he starts to look like a loser, then he no longer seems infallible. He’s no longer the strongman and arbiter of the system. Although elites are invested in him and his system, there may eventually come a point where people start saying, “maybe somebody else, Vladimir Vladimirovich, maybe somebody else might handle the system better.” It could start with the hardliners trying to push themselves forward.

That’s why, again, we see him doubling down. He’s got himself in a corner in the war and in a corner domestically at home. He has made himself the face of this war in Ukraine. His September 30th speech basically said it’s his war, his annexation, his Russia. And so, everything will fall on him if it falls apart. Reynolds: In the autocratic system that Putin has built, he has to stand for election every so often even though it’s mostly window dressing. But it periodically renews his legitimacy. One of those years is 2024. Is he facing a deadline? Does he need to look like he’s won this war by 2024? Hill: One would think so. In 2024, the reelection has to be in the early part of the year. So, we’ve got a year and a few months in the Russian political calculations to start to prepare for this and ensure that it all goes smoothly. That was why Putin wanted to get the quick victory in Ukraine well out of the way. Ukraine started in February and March of 2022, because February and March of 2024 will be election time. I’m sure Putin thought he would have been unassailable with a quick, victorious war. Ukraine would be back in the fold and then probably after that, Belarus. Moldova as well, perhaps. There would have been a reframing of the next phase of Putin as the great czar of a reconstituted “Russkiy mir” or “Russian world.” If Putin had succeeded at that, maybe he could have found himself in a position where he could have begun to delegate some power to others. Just this past week, on October 7th, Putin turned 70. He’s in that age when people are asking, does he die in office? There are lots of questions about succession. 2024 is very much an inflection point for the system. Reynolds: Do you feel like Ukraine is on course for a military victory and what would that mean to the Russian side? Hill: Ukraine has already had a great moral, political and military victory. Russia has not achieved the aims of its special military operation. But I think Putin is obviously hoping that now, with all of the nuclear saber-rattling, threats of nuclear Armageddon, deploying Elon Musk and others to convey his messages, that basically he can take the territory that he’s got and get recognition of that. And then he hopes that he will be able to put pressure back on Ukraine. He’d still like to see the Ukrainian political system crumble away. He’d like to get somebody as leader of Ukraine who is personally loyal to him. Putin hopes that he’ll still prevail, that he’ll find other ways of getting what he wanted when he went across the border in February. Reynolds: So to some extent, the biggest thing that Putin wants right now is to get Zelenskyy out. He wants somebody more pliant. Hill: That’s exactly what he wants. And I’m sure he feels that he might still get that. I mean, everything that he’s doing is an effort to discredit Ukraine and Ukrainians and Zelenskyy. Ukraine has the right to choose their own leadership. But Putin will try to manipulate this whichever way he can. He’ll keep trying to soften the battlefield beyond Ukraine, keep on trying to poison attitudes internationally against Ukraine. Reynolds: Along those lines, what do you make of the fact that some Americans, primarily in the Trump wing of the Republican Party and some Fox News personalities, are expressing doubts about how much support the United States should direct to Ukraine? Is there something about this conflict that you don’t think they understand? Hill: This goes back to the point I tried to make when I testified at the first impeachment trial against President Trump. There’s a direct line between that episode and now. Putin has managed to seed hostile sentiment toward Ukraine. Even if people think they are criticizing Ukraine for their own domestic political purposes, because they want to claim that the Biden administration is giving too much support for Ukraine instead of giving more support to Americans, etc. — they’re replaying the targeted messaging that Vladimir Putin has very carefully fed into our political arena. People may think that they’re acting independently, but they are echoing the Kremlin’s propaganda. Reynolds: What do you think is the right response from the West if Putin does detonate some sort of nuclear weapon, either as a demonstration or something else? Hill: What Putin is trying to do is to get us to talk about the threat of nuclear war instead of what he is doing in Ukraine. He wants the U.S. and Europe to contemplate, as he says, the risks that we faced during the Cuban Missile Crisis or the Euromissile crisis. He wants us to face the prospect of a great superpower war. His solution is to have secret diplomacy, as we did during Cuban Missile Crisis, and have a direct compromise between the United States and Russia. But there’s no strategic standoff here. This is pure nuclear blackmail. There can’t be a compromise based on him not setting off a nuclear weapon if we hand over Ukraine. Putin is behaving like a rogue state because, well, he is a rogue state at this point. And he’s being explicit about what he wants. We have to pull all the diplomatic stops out. We have to ensure that he’s not going to have the effect that he wants with this nuclear brinkmanship. Putin is also making it very clear that to get what you want in the world, you have to have a nuclear weapon and to protect yourself, you also have to have a nuclear weapon. So this is an absolute mess. Global nuclear stability is on a knife edge. But again, this is not about strategic issues. This is not an issue of strategic stability. This is Vladimir Putin pissed off because he hasn’t got what he wanted in a war that he started. It’s another attempt to adapt to the battlefield. Reynolds: Can this war end in a way that would be satisfying for the West and with Putin remaining as Russian leader? Or is this the beginning of a revolution that’s going to be very messy and dangerous? Hill: It’s unlikely this ends in any satisfying way. You need every side willing to compromise, and Putin doesn’t want to compromise his goals. Any compromise is, in any case, always at Ukraine’s expense because Putin has taken Ukrainian territory. If we think about World War I, World War II or the settlements in many other conflicts, they always involved some kind territorial disposition that left one side very unhappy. There is not going to be a happy or satisfying ending for anybody, and it’s also not going to be happy or satisfying for Vladimir Putin either, honestly. Reynolds: It is striking to me that of all the conflicts that Russia has been engaged in since Putin became president, that none of them have been resolved with any kind of a peace settlement. They just have been fought to stalemate. Hill: There’s not any good outcome I can see come out of this. What’s incumbent upon us is to figure out is how to constrain Russia’s ability to put Ukraine under pressure again in the future or invade again. If there’s any interim freezing of battle lines, make sure that they’re not recognized as official. Maybe we can contemplate some international receivership. We’ve had many of these different formulations in the past for disputed territory. We have to ensure, again, that Ukraine can always defend itself and make it impossible for Putin to break out of constraints and do this again. But that still leaves you with lots of questions about the future relationship with Russia, the future configuration of any European security institutions. How do we reconfigure ourselves internationally to deal with this? The United Nations has proven to be in dire need of an overhaul. The United Nations has been a major player in this conflict. The secretary-general has been heavily involved investigating war crimes and pressing resolutions. But the United Nations has shown itself inadequate because of the configuration of the Security Council and the veto. Everybody’s talking about how to address this. Reynolds: It occurs to me that there’s a kind of reckoning coming for NATO. With Finland joining, that adds a long direct border between NATO and Russia. With the new union between Belarus and Russia, there’s going to be another NATO border between Poland and Belarus. Considering the fact that NATO’s already getting a line across Europe that it’s going to have to defend, should NATO consider membership for Ukraine? Hill: This is also going to be a big issue, right? There are so many people out there who still look at Ukraine as a proxy war. Many of the people trying to push Ukraine to surrender are basically those who believe that the United States or NATO is somehow using Ukraine in a proxy war with Russia. We’re not in a proxy war with Russia, just like we weren’t in a proxy war with Germany during World War I when we were trying to get German forces out of France and Belgium. It wasn’t a proxy war either when we were trying to get Germany out of Poland and all the other places that it invaded in Europe during World War II. We are trying to help Ukraine liberate itself, having been invaded by Russia. This whole proxy war debate deprives Ukraine of agency. But, if we talk about Ukraine being part of NATO at this particular moment, it will simply feed into this flawed discussion. It will detract from the essence of what this war is, which is Russia trying to seize Ukrainian territory. Russia believes NATO is simply a cover for the United States in Europe. I think it should be very clear right now with Finland and Sweden wanting to join that this is not the case at all. Finland and Sweden did not apply to NATO before, they have now because NATO is focused on ensuring common collective security and defense, and Russia has put all of Europe at risk. I see current NATO expansion as a kind of an interim step, a way station to thinking more broadly about how we configure ourselves after Ukraine. You know, there’s also talk about making Ukraine a “giant Israel,” making Ukraine completely self-sufficient for its own security, as, frankly, Finland was before. I think we have to have an open discussion about all of this and not be fixated on one aspect or another. Reynolds: In other words, even if Ukraine wins the war for its territory, even if Putin is somehow constrained or deposed, we’re still at the very beginning of a rethinking of the international order that those outcomes are not going to solve. Hill: Yes. We’ve also had the impacts of Covid. We’ve got a climate crisis, which should be evident to everybody by now. There are so many things that we need to contend with, and we’ve only got the skeleton of an international system. Putin is holding the whole world hostage. We’ve got so many things that we have to deal with. I understand why the Global South is so frustrated with all of this: “While you’re fighting this war in Ukraine over the same kind of territorial disputes you guys have been having for a hundred years now, we’re dying here from disease and climate change. Our countries have flooded. We’re starving and you guys are expecting us to help you solve this?” The United Nations system is breaking down, as [António] Guterres, the secretary-general, has said over and over again. All the alarm bells are going off. And Vladimir Putin is behaving as if it’s the 1780s all over again. Reynolds: So we need a new or a revamped global order to address the whole problem? Hill: That’s obvious. So how do we do it? A lot of people don’t find the idea of a revamped United Nations very popular. I can just imagine some of my former colleagues groaning loudly. We definitely need a slimmed-down version. But we do need international institutions to deal with the magnitude of the problems that we’re facing. It’s ironic that Elon Musk, the man who has been talking about getting us to Mars should be Putin’s messenger for the war in Ukraine, when we’re having a really hard time getting our act together on this planet. But it’s glaringly obvious to ordinary people that we need to do so. Time is not on our side.

Sautter III Center for Strategic Communication at Montclair State University shows that in the hours following Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, the use of hate speech terms increased immediately on the social media platform. Looking at Twitter data between October 22 and October 28, using the Tweetbinder analytics program, the study examined a range of vulgar and hostile terms for individuals based on race, religion, ethnicity and orientation. The seven-day average of Tweets using the studied hate terms prior to Musk’s acquisition was never higher than 84 times per hour. However, on October 28 from midnight to noon (immediately following Musk’s acquisition), the studied hate speech was Tweeted some 4,778 times. Tweetbinder’s sentiment analysis tool, which measures positive or negative tone in Tweets, was also utilized to assess potential hostility in the collected data. The study, available to read in full, suggests that certain users were celebrating a reduction in perceived speech constraints on the platform. The data conclusively shows that there is correlation between Musk’s arrival and a broader perceived acceptability to posted hostile content on Twitter. “The idea of reducing moderation on social media has always led to the spread of hate and conspiracies. This is particularly dangerous to young people on platforms,” said Bond Benton, a Montclair professor who contributed to this study and researches online extremism.

Elon Musk now owns Twitter — and a huge number of impossible political problems around speech, content moderation, and trying to make money.","By  Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of the Verge, host of the Decoder podcast, and co-host of The Vergecast. You fucked up real good, kiddo. Twitter is a disaster clown car company that is successful despite itself, and there is no possible way to grow users and revenue without making a series of enormous compromises that will ultimately destroy your reputation and possibly cause grievous damage to your other companies. I say this with utter confidence because the problems with Twitter are not engineering problems. They are political problems. Twitter, the company, makes very little interesting technology; the tech stack is not the valuable asset. The asset is the user base: hopelessly addicted politicians, reporters, celebrities, and other people who should know better but keep posting anyway. You! You, Elon Musk, are addicted to Twitter. You’re the asset. You just bought yourself for $44 billion dollars. The problem when the asset is people is that people are intensely complicated, and trying to regulate how people behave is historically a miserable experience, especially when that authority is vested in a single powerful individual. What I mean is that you are now the King of Twitter, and people think that you, personally, are responsible for everything that happens on Twitter now. It also turns out that absolute monarchs usually get murdered when shit goes sideways. Here are some examples: you can write as many polite letters to advertisers as you want, but you cannot reasonably expect to collect any meaningful advertising revenue if you do not promise those advertisers “brand safety.” That means you have to ban racism, sexism, transphobia, and all kinds of other speech that is totally legal in the United States but reveals people to be total assholes. So you can make all the promises about “free speech” you want, but the dull reality is that you still have to ban a bunch of legal speech if you want to make money. And when you start doing that, your creepy new right-wing fanboys are going to viciously turn on you, just like they turn on every other social network that realizes the same essential truth. Actually, there’s a step before trying to get the ad money: it turns out that most people do not want to participate in horrible unmoderated internet spaces full of shitty racists and not-all-men fedora bullies. (This is why Twitter is so small compared to its peers!) What most people want from social media is to have nice experiences and to feel validated all the time. They want to live at Disney World. So if you want more people to join Twitter and actually post tweets, you have to make the experience much, much more pleasant. Which means: moderating more aggressively! Again, every “alternative” social network has learned this lesson the hard way. Like, over and over and over again. Also, everyone crying about “free speech” conveniently ignores that the biggest threat to free speech in America is the fucking government, which seems completely bored of the First Amendment. They’re out here banning books, Elon! President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have identical policy positions on Section 230: they both want to repeal it. Do you know why? Because the First Amendment prohibits them from making explicit speech regulations, so they keep threatening to repeal the law that allows social networks to even exist in order to exert indirect pressure on content policy. It’s not subtle! State governments are even less subtle: both Texas and Florida have passed speech regulations that overtly tell social media companies how to moderate, in open hostility to the First Amendment. Figuring out how to comply with these laws is not an engineering problem (not least because compliance might be impossible). It is a legal problem because these laws are blatantly unconstitutional, and the only appropriate response to them is to tell the government to shut up and go away. (A big problem here is that the courts are pretty stupid about the internet!) A challenge to these laws, partially funded by Twitter, is headed to the Supreme Court, which is the polar opposite of a predictable system: it is a group of uncool weirdos with lifetime appointments that can radically reshape American life however it wants.  You can’t deploy AI at this problem: you have to go out and defend the actual First Amendment against the bad laws in Texas and Florida, whose taxes you like and whose governors you seem pretty fond of. Are you ready for what that looks like? Are you ready to sit before Congress and politely decline to engage in their content capture sessions for hours on end? Are you ready to do any of this without the incredibly respected policy experts whose leader you first harassed and then fired? This is what you signed up for. It’s way more boring than rockets, cars, and rockets with cars on them. And it gets worse the second you leave the United States! Germany is a huge market for Tesla. Are you going to flout Germany’s speech laws? I would bet not. The Indian government basically demands social media companies provide potential hostages in order to operate in that country; you can’t engineer your way out of that shit. Are you ready to experience the pressure Twitter faces in the Middle East to block and restrict accounts? Are you ready for the fact that the Iranian government will fucking murder people over their social media posts? (Are you ready for how Twitter is being used by Iranians protesting that government right now?) Are you excited for the Chinese government to find ways to threaten Tesla’s huge business in that country over content that appears on Twitter? Because it’s going to happen. The essential truth of every social network is that the product is content moderation, and everyone hates the people who decide how content moderation works. Content moderation is what Twitter makes — it is the thing that defines the user experience. It’s what YouTube makes, it’s what Instagram makes, it’s what TikTok makes. They all try to incentivize good stuff, disincentivize bad stuff, and delete the really bad stuff. Do you know why YouTube videos are all eight to 10 minutes long? Because that’s how long a video has to be to qualify for a second ad slot in the middle. That’s content moderation, baby — YouTube wants a certain kind of video, and it created incentives to get it. That’s the business you’re in now. The longer you fight it or pretend that you can sell something else, the more Twitter will drag you into the deepest possible muck of defending indefensible speech. And if you turn on a dime and accept that growth requires aggressive content moderation and pushing back against government speech regulations around the country and world, well, we’ll see how your fans react to that. Anyhow, welcome to hell. This was your idea.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily. The Verge is a vox media network © 2023 Vox Media, LLC.

Elon Musk (and his consortium of much smaller investors) now owns Twitter. We need to take seriously the possibility that this will end up being one of the funniest things that’s ever happened. Tesla CEO Elon Musk in Stavanger, Norway, on Aug. 29, 2022. That’s because as of this moment, it looks like Musk dug a big hole in the forest, carefully filled it with punji sticks and crocodiles, and then jumped in. This was made immediately clear by Musk’s “Dear Twitter Advertisers” tweet as the deal closed:  Dear Twitter Advertisers pic.twitter.com/GMwHmInPAS — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 27, 2022  The statement starts off, promisingly, with a blatant lie: “The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important for the future of civilization to have a common digital town square.” Musk apparently believes that no one will remember that until three weeks ago, he was desperately trying not to buy Twitter. The only reason he did is because he was about to lose Twitter’s lawsuit to force him to buy it. This may be the greatest “you can’t fire me because I quit” moment in history. The significance of the rest of his statement is more subtle. To understand it, you have to start with the basics. Twitter currently makes 90 percent of its revenue from advertising. (The rest is largely from data licensing.) This means that you, the Twitter user, are not Twitter’s customers. You are its product. Its customers are corporate advertisers and, as every businessperson knows, the customer is always right. Grocery stores care about the people shopping for Cheetos, not about the feelings of the Cheetos themselves. Twitter’s content moderation has sometimes been heavy-handed — especially when it froze my account because David Duke got mad at me. But this is not because Twitter is run by a woke mob. It’s because Twitter needs to keep advertisers happy — and their top priority is a certain kind of environment for their ads. This can take specific forms. Delta probably has it written into its contract that its ads won’t run near any tweets about plane crashes. But more generally, advertisers don’t want anything controversial that gets people out of the buying mood, or worse, mad at the brands themselves. Proctor & Gamble can’t allow its ads for Charmin, targeted at the Upscale Panera Mom micro-demographic, to appear below frothing diatribes about annihilating all Muslims. Twitter is also, speaking just in financial terms, a crummy business. It’s only been profitable for two years of its existence, 2018 and 2019. In 2020 it lost over $1 billion, rebounding to lose a mere $222 million in 2021. To make matters worse, Musk’s deal to buy Twitter involved taking out $12.5 billion in loans. This means that Twitter will have to come up with an additional $1 billion a year to service this debt. Thus if Twitter simply continues on its current path, it will lose huge amounts of money indefinitely. But if advertisers get nervous about Musk’s management and flee the platform, it could see losses every year in the multiple billions of dollars. It’s true that Musk has said, “I don’t care about the economics at all.” But even as the richest man on earth, he has to care about them. He has a current estimated net worth of $220 billion, but that’s not $220 billion in cash sitting in a bank vault — it’s mostly tied up in his stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. Thus to cover big Twitter losses, he would have to sell off more of his stock every year. This would be painful in monetary terms but more so in terms of power: Eventually he would get into a situation in which he could lose control of the companies, Tesla in particular. Moreover, Tesla is publicly traded, and while it’s fallen 45 percent since its high a year ago, it remains way overvalued by normal metrics. Right now its price-earnings ratio is 70. The historical average for the S&P 500 is about 15. The price-earnings ratio for both Ford and GM right now is 6. This is why Musk hit the ground running with a groveling attempt to propitiate advertisers. He absolutely must keep them happy. As he put it, “Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise.” And that’s where the hilarity begins. Musk has engaged in endless paeans to the glory of free speech and the need to end Twitter’s invidious censorship. This clearly isn’t a subject he’s thought deeply about, since he said back in May that Twitter should delete “tweets that are wrong and bad.” Still, his vague pronouncements have given him a legion of right-wing acolytes who feel they’ve been ill-treated by Twitter. But they are not Musk’s constituency now. Advertisers are. Even if Musk had some genuine commitment to free speech (which he absolutely does not), it would be essentially impossible for him not to continue significant content moderation. That’s why, after a brief nod to his wish for Twitter to be a place “where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner,” he quickly pivoted to telling advertisers that “Twitter obviously cannot be a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences! In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all.” This could have been the mission statement of pre-Musk Twitter. But now there’s one big difference: When the content moderation of Twitter remains largely the same, the sense of betrayal among Musk’s super-fans will explode with the force of a supernova. And they will scream at Musk about it nonstop — on Twitter. Another mogul might have the fortitude to ignore this. But Musk does not, judging by past performance. You can also judge this by current performance: On his first full day on the job, Musk is personally “digging in” to the complaints of Catturd ™.  I will be digging in more today — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 28, 2022  And while Musk has announced a new “content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints,” he will feel constantly compelled to either explain why he’s standing by his underlings’ moderation decisions, or reverse them. Then he will inevitably be drawn into personally making more and more content calls, perhaps giving the thumbs up or thumbs down to individual tweets. It will be hell on earth for him. No matter what decisions he makes, he will infuriate large swaths of Twitter. The left will see its suspicions about him confirmed. The right will see him as a horrendous sellout, just another lying Big Tech swine. Joe Rogan will shake his head sadly about what happened to Elon. Eventually what used to give Musk the greatest pleasure, opening up Twitter on his phone, will be a source of excruciating pain. And that’s just the beginning. Musk has important business interests around the world, and the potential riptides are endless. What happens when Kim Kardashian starts tweeting about how Taiwan is an independent country? Will the government of China quietly suggest to Musk that he do something about this, or will they make things hard for Tesla’s Shanghai plant and block the import of Teslas? What do other Tesla shareholders do if he defies China, and they find out his little bird app adventure is losing them money? What happens when a SpaceX rocket explodes, but Musk has been too busy adjudicating which Nazi furries are going to be suspended for a month? This future is obviously not foreordained. Possibly Musk will do what no human has ever been able to do before and invent 1) content moderation that everyone likes at an enormous scale, and 2) a way to make huge amounts of money off Twitter. Maybe Tesla will become so profitable that he can use it to subsidize Twitter until 2090. But the most likely outcome is that he’s just asked the monkey’s paw to grant him his greatest wish. Now look as the paw crooks its gnarled finger, and Musk’s love for Twitter ends up obliterating the Twitter experience for one specific user: Elon Musk.

Though it’s still an aggressive and abrupt Day One move, Agrawal was inevitable, given his well-documented clashes and a failed virtual meeting with Musk. It’s also no surprise that Gadde was among the first to go, in spite of being a well-respected figure in the company. Musk previously singled out the top executive with accusations of “left wing bias” over her role in policy decision making at Twitter, driving a wave of racist hate and harassment her way. The road to take Twitter private has been a rocky one. Musk first began flirting with the idea of owning Twitter in early April, when he bought 9.2% of the company for $3 billion. But he didn’t stop there. Less than 10 fateful days later, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO declared his intent to buy Twitter for $44 billion. Twitter accepted, but Musk soon got cold feet and pulled out all the stops to get out of the deal, landing the parties in the Delaware Court of Chancery. After enduring some embarrassing pre-trial discovery and facing a swiftly approaching date for his deposition, Musk announced that he would follow through after all. It’s not immediately clear why Musk backtracked, agreeing to buy Twitter after all. It’s possible that Musk and his legal team read the tea leaves on their coming trial, which was originally set to begin on October 17. Twitter sued Musk over the summer to force the Tesla and SpaceX CEO to follow through with the deal. Musk countersued Twitter in response, making unfounded claims that the company mislead him about the number of automated accounts on the platform — a number that is critical for advertisers and brands who want human eyeballs on their paid ads. As litigation between Musk and Twitter ramped up, Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen McCormick made it clear that she wasn’t here to humor Musk’s erratic shenanigans. In early October when Musk announced, again, that he would buy Twitter if he could kill the upcoming trial, Judge McCormick only agreed if Musk could close the deal by Friday, October 28. If he had missed the deadline, we’d all be looking at a fresh Musk/Twitter trial date set for November. On this, the first day that Elon Musk officially owns Twitter, it’s also not clear which direction Musk plans to take the platform. The chaotic and often contradictory billionaire has in the past promised to restore former President Trump’s account, rid the platform of all automated bots, which personally bother him as one of the most followed users on the platform (good luck), and touted Twitter’s potential as a neutral ground square and a counterbalance to his complaints about traditional media outlets, which at times do not report on his goings-on favorably. In reality, Twitter is a struggling yet incredibly prominent platform, one where heads of state and hardcore porn regularly intermix and one that, after a long phase of stagnation, had finally begun to introduce improvements to its products and policies. It remains to be seen if Musk will turn back the clock on those experiments or see some through while claiming to reinvent the wheel (monetizing creators, certainly an original idea!), but it’s difficult to imagine how he can accomplish any of his goals while potentially gutting the company’s workforce. Musk’s denial of reports that he plans to cut 75% of Twitter’s staff is far from reassuring, considering that laying off a third or half of employees would still cost thousands of workers their jobs. Musk has also talked a big game about turning back Twitter’s moderation and platform safety efforts, but he seemed to suddenly realize how this might make advertisers intensely skittish, publishing a letter reassuring them on Thursday. “Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!” he wrote, backtracking on his promises to make Twitter a free-for-all hellscape. Dear Twitter Advertisers pic.twitter.com/GMwHmInPAS — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 27, 2022  We don’t know what the future has in store for one of the world’s biggest social networks but we do know that Musk has accomplished what once was unthinkable, taking control of Twitter for $44 billion. But the conclusion to the monthslong saga is just the beginning of a new chapter of uncertainty at Twitter, raising a million questions about what the platform is actually worth, what it’s for and what, exactly, he plans to do with it.

As cases of RSV spread, the respiratory virus has hospitals stretched to the limit, what's next for new Twitter owner Elon Musk: 5 Things ...","On today's episode of the 5 Things podcast: Respiratory virus in infants and kids is threatening to overwhelm hospitals Health reporter Adrianna Rodriguez has the latest. Plus, Sarasota Herald-Tribune political editor Zac Anderson looks at partisan politics in public schools, business reporter Charisse Jones gives the latest recession outlook, Elon Musk officially owns Twitter and the World Series begins.

This transcript was automatically generated, and then edited for clarity in its current form. There may be some differences between the audio and the text. Taylor Wilson: Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson, and this is 5 Things you need to know Friday, the 28th of October, 2022. Today, a virus that's hitting hospitals hard. Adrianna Rodriguez: The COVID pandemic has been suppressing respiratory viruses for the past two years, but this year they're back and they're causing more hospitalizations. Taylor Wilson: Plus, a closer look at how partisan politics have infiltrated public schools. Elon Musk buys Twitter, and more. ♦ A respiratory virus known as RSV is hitting hospitals hard. In adults, RSV may appear as a common cold, but children and babies are more at risk for severe disease. USA TODAY Health reporter Adrianna Rodriguez explains why this uptick is important. Adrianna Rodriguez: Typically, pre-pandemic RSV had appeared around November, late October, and sort of continued on into the winter months around March. In 2020, we didn't really see RSV, neither did we see much flu or other respiratory viruses. Then in 2021, we actually saw an uptick of RSV in the summertime, which is really weird, and totally unheard of. This time around, we're starting to see RSV now a little earlier, but closer to where we normally see it in the fall and winter. The concern really is that we're overwhelming hospitals and using a lot of resources for this one virus, when we're at the time of year where multiple viruses circulate. Taylor Wilson: You can find a link to Adrianna's story in today's show notes. There are more tips for what parents can look out for, like dehydration, fever, or wheezing, all associated with RSV. ♦ USA TODAY's latest States of America explores how partisan politics have infiltrated public schools. It premieres tonight at 10:00pm Eastern on USA TODAY Network's YouTube page. Producer PJ Elliott spoke with Zac Anderson, political editor for the Sarasota Harold Tribune, about what to expect in the latest episode. Zac Anderson: The States of America is a long-form video series from USA TODAY, and they've done a few episodes around the country. They did one looking at abortion issues in Texas. They did one looking at farmers in Indiana, and they got interested in some of the education politics here in Florida. The show is going to be released on the USA TODAY Channel, which you can get on different streaming services. You can also get it on YouTube and on the USA TODAY website. PJ Elliott: Well, Zac, let's get into one of the topics. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has been compared to Donald Trump on a lot of issues. How are these educational issues separating himself from the former president? Zac Anderson: As a president, it's harder to get bills passed. Trump's signature achievement was his tax cut bill, he didn't pass any education bills. But DeSantis has actually passed a lot of bills. And so I think that, rather than talk about some of these issues, he's really made a mark on them by passing actual legislation that has really transformed Florida's schools in many ways. PJ Elliott: Well, real quick before I let you go, let's get into the local level. How heated are these school board elections getting in Florida? Zac Anderson: Very. Very, very, very heated. More heated than I've ever seen. Usually, school board elections, historically, they're pretty sleepy. Candidates might raise a few thousand dollars. Now, you see candidates raising hundreds of thousands of dollars. You see Governor DeSantis endorsing in school board races, which we've never seen from a governor before. ♦ Taylor Wilson: Well, after months of experts predicting that we could see a recession in the US, will it actually come true? PJ Elliott spoke with USA TODAY Business reporter Charisse Jones to find out. Charisse Jones: The GDP grew 2.6% in the third quarter, and that was a real bright spot, because the economy had actually contracted in the first half of the year, and that was largely due to our trade deficit shrinking. Our exports were starting to outpace our imports, and business and consumer spending rose a little. PJ Elliott: Charisse, the Dow rallied, but reports were mixed. What does that say about the economy? Charisse Jones: I think people are just really nervous. They're seeing these bright spots like the GDP report that came out, that make them feel a little more confident. But at the same time, they're really bracing for this recession that so many economists have been talking about, and that the Fed has really been kind of pushing us toward, with all of the interest rate hikes that they've done, and the ones that they're still forecasting and planning to do. PJ Elliott: Well, with things looking better right now, does this mean that we may avoid a recession that a lot of experts were predicting? Charisse Jones: Probably not. Unfortunately, business and consumer spending is still slowing down. Some companies are already doing layoffs, and that's because we're still dealing with inflation that's at about a 40-year high. We added 263,000 jobs in September, which is great, but that's a lot less than the 383,000 jobs that we added in the previous quarter. And so people are remaining really concerned. ♦ Taylor Wilson: Elon Musk now owns Twitter. The deal was initially supposed to close later today, but the New York Times reported last night that he began firing several top executives at the company. With the deal, Twitter is now again a private company, nearly nine years after going public. The billionaire agreed to buy the company in April and take it private, but he then spent months trying to back out of the deal, claiming that Twitter misrepresented the number of spam and fake accounts on its platform. Something Twitter denied. The company then sued Musk to complete the purchase. A Delaware court had set a deadline for today for Musk to finalize the deal. The price, $44 billion. Before closing the deal, Musk changed his own Twitter bio to call himself Chief Twit. With more on the deal, and what happens next for the social media platform, I'm now joined by Money editor Riley Gutierrez McDermid. So Riley is the deal official? Riley Gutierrez McDermid: Elon Musk made a bid for Twitter in April. He offered, at the time, a per share price that is roughly $44 billion in valuation. Since then, that share price has gone down substantially. It has climbed up in the last few days, closer to what he bid for it, which is about $54 per share. And now it looks like he might be paying around... Well, lower, but closer to the value that he originally bid. It was a very touch and go deal, and there were certainly many market watchers who posited that it was either one of the greatest business trolls of all time or would never be a deal that was completed at all. Taylor Wilson: And so what happens next for the platform? Can we expect major changes? Riley Gutierrez McDermid: Musk has talked a lot about how he wants to turn Twitter into a super app. Modeled on the types that you see in Asia, where not only can you chat there, you can bank there, you can send money. We know that he's already started firing some top executives. There were reports that he could fire as much as 75% of Twitter's workforce, which is about 7,500 people total right now. So that would take it down to about 2000 people for the whole workforce. And the vast majority of those people work in something called harm reduction, which is what social media calls moderation of harmful content like trolling, harassing, rape threats, things like that. I think the average user of Twitter can expect a more confrontational experience when they use the platform. But Musk is a very good businessman and is already pitching ideas about subscription models where people could maybe pay to have less exposure to certain content, more exposure to other content. He said that it wouldn't be a free-for-all hellscape on Twitter. He didn't, however, notably make this statement to users, he made it to advertisers. And advertisers are going to need to see a certain level of civility on the platform before they allow big name brand corporations to advertise there. And one of those will be whether or not former President Donald Trump is allowed, and his very vocal following, are allowed back onto the platform. Taylor Wilson: You can read more about the deal on USATODAY.com. ♦ The World Series is finally here. Game 1 is set for tonight in Texas between the National League champion Philadelphia Phillies and the American League champion Houston Astros. The Phillies are in their first World Series since 2009 and are trying to win it all for the first time since 2008. They had the second fewest wins of any playoff team, but pulled off some major upsets on their way to the final. As for the Astros, they're undefeated this post-season. The 'Stros are back in the World Series for the fourth time in the last six years. But their 2017 championship has since been controversial, after Major League Baseball found they were illegally using technology to steal signs from opposing teams. So would the Astros be forgiven with the championship this time? USA TODAY Sports' Bob Nightengale and Steve Gardner weigh in. Bob Nightengale: There's only three position players left on the team, of that two pitchers. So hey, let's be honest, when they got caught in 2017, there were about a quart of the teams at baseball doing the same thing, the same teams they were playing against. They just happened to have a whistleblower, and their teams didn't. They still won games on the road and all that. So I think it'll always linger with those guys. We'll see what happens during the Hall of Fame balloting when guys like Jose Altuve goes on the ballot, but it should be forgotten about because this team is this great. Steve Gardner: I think that the people inside baseball recognize that it's a different Astros team, but I think the casual fan, probably the general baseball audience that's watching this World Series, still is going to associate Houston with cheating, no matter how long, or how successful they are since the scandal ended. I think that's what they have to overcome and it's not something that they're going to do with one World Series win. Taylor Wilson: These two squads have not played each other in the playoffs since 1980 when they were both still in the National League. You can tune in to game one tonight at 8:00 Eastern, 5:00 Pacific on Fox. And stay with USA TODAY'S sports for coverage throughout the series. And you can find 5 Things every morning right here, wherever you're listening right now. Thanks to PJ Elliott, Shannon Green, and all of our great reporters for their work on the show, and I'm back tomorrow with more of 5 Things from USA TODAY."

The merger between Twitter, Inc. and X Holdings II, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of X Holdings I, Inc., wholly owned by Elon R. Musk became effective on October 27, 2022. Each share of Twitter, Inc. Common Stock was exchanged for USD 54.20 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. The Exchange also notifies the Securities and Exchange Commission that as a result of the above indicated conditions this security was suspended from trading before market open on October 28, 2022. A filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission confirms that Elon Musk has taken over Twitter, and its shares have been taken off the New York stock exchange. Here’s what you need to know: A timeline of Musk’s Twitter acquisition: months of corporate to-and-fro, distrust and unpredictability Some have expressed concerns about potential changes to Twitter’s content moderation policies now that it’s in the hands of the Tesla billionaire, while others celebrated how they expect the platform’s newly minted leader will handle content and speech on Twitter. Hate speech and misinformation experts are bracing for the return of Donald Trump to the platform, as Elon Musk completes his acquisition of Twitter. - Guardian staff The saga is over. Elon Musk has finally bought Twitter after months of to-and-fro marked by legal rows, U-turns and, inevitably, Twitter spats. There will be more drama to come, by virtue of the platform’s centrality to news and politics as well as the unpredictable personality of its new owner. But the months leading up to the deal have been compelling corporate entertainment for bystanders. Here is a timeline of what happened: After Musk’s takeover, the question on everyone’s mind is whether former president Donald Trump will be allowed to return to the platform after being permanently removed in January 2021. Trump responded to the Twitter deal on his own platform, Truth Social, on Friday, stating he is “very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands”. “Twitter must now work hard to rid itself of all the bots and fake accounts that have hurt it so badly,” he wrote. “I LOVE TRUTH!” Musk seemed to allude to the question of whether Trump would return to the platform in a Tweet on Friday, stating that the platform would be forming “a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints” to address such issues. Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints. No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes. Months before purchasing Twitter, Elon Musk said he believed the platform’s direct message feature should be end-to-end encrypted which would prevent anyone except the sender and recipient from accessing the messages. Now, digital privacy group Fight for the Future has asked the newly minted social media platform owner to confirm his plan to secure Twitter’s messaging feature. Fight for the Future has previously launched a campaign pressuring all tech companies to encrypt their messaging services by default including Apple and Facebook. Many have expressed concern about their privacy and security on Twitter now that Musk has taken over. End-to-end encryption would not only secure messages from the peering eyes of people inside the company but it would also make messages safe from hacks as well as law enforcement requests. Hi @elonmusk just checking on this. Will you re-affirm that you plan to make Twitter DMs end-to-end encrypted? Can you please give a timeline for how soon this will happen? This is one of the most important things Twitter could do to protect human rights and free expression. https://t.co/WCLritjdiQ Hi, it’s Maanvi Singh, taking over the blog from my colleague Gloria Oladipo. Now that Elon Musk owns Twitter, does that mean he can access anyone’s Twitter data? Vox had a good story on what happens to your DMs, and whether they’re safe from Musk: Now, is Musk going to waltz into Twitter’s headquarters on his first full day (maybe holding a sink again), fire up his computer, and immediately set about reading all of your DMs, peering in on private accounts’ tweets, and harvesting users’ phone numbers? Probably not, and whether that happens at all depends on several factors, according to Andy Wu, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. Twitter’s management team would first have to be amenable to fulfilling Musk’s requests. If not, he has to replace them. To do that, he’d have to go through the board of directors. It shouldn’t be too difficult to get them to agree to Musk’s demands, though. He reportedly fired several of Twitter’s top executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal and Vijaya Gadde, who was the head of legal, public policy, and trust and safety. The new CEO, Bloomberg says, is Musk himself. As for the board, based on the preliminary proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Musk plans to install his own board immediately. There are also whatever internal controls Twitter has — including those it’s supposed to have implemented per consent orders with agencies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) — that might get in Musk’s way. Musk would have to work with Twitter employees to get that data, and they might not be willing to help him read someone’s DMs. It’s hard to imagine Musk making such a request and that request not somehow being leaked to the press. And that would certainly be a disaster for a company Musk paid a lot of money for. But even if Musk eventually does get his hands on the DMs of people he doesn’t like or wants to keep tabs on, the article argues that this isn’t the biggest security concern: Twitter users should perhaps be concerned not about their data leaking to Musk but about their data leaking to everyone. Twitter’s track record when it comes to security already isn’t great, and Musk might be laying off employees who are essential to maintaining the protections it has that actually work (Musk has reportedly said he doesn’t plan to lay off that many people or that soon). Read more from Vox’s Sara Morrison here. Another helpful tidbit about free speech concerns and disinformation on Twitter under Musk’s rule from the Guardian’s Dan Milmo and Alex Hern: Senior politicians have warned Elon Musk over content moderation on Twitter, with the EU stressing the platform will “fly by our rules” and a UK minister expressing concerns over hate speech under the billionaire’s ownership. The EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, wrote on the platform on Friday that “in Europe, the bird will fly by our rules”, in response to Musk’s earlier tweet saying “the bird is freed” in apparent confirmation that he had bought the business. The EU is introducing the digital services act, which includes provisions for removal of illegal content including hate speech. The UK government flagged its own concerns on Friday, as the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, said it would be “concerning” if a relaxation of content moderation led to a proliferation on hate speech on the platform. Read the full piece here. Here’s more info on the payout that ex-Twitter executives will receive amid Musk’s buyout from The Guardian’s Jasper Jolly: Twitter’s top executives will be entitled to “golden parachute” payouts worth more than $120m if removed as expected by new owner Elon Musk. Musk reportedly immediately removed chief executive Parag Agrawal, finance boss Ned Segal, and Vijaya Gadde, head of legal, policy and safety, after closing the $44bn takeover of the social network company. The debt-funded deal has become a costly exercise even for Musk, the world’s richest man, thanks to the value of his stake in electric car manufacturer Tesla, with bankers, advisers and lawyers all racking up significant fees. Legal costs in particular are likely to have run into the tens of millions of dollars after Musk in July tried to terminate the deal with Twitter, arguing that the company had misled him over the number of bot accounts on the social network. After months of legal wrangling Musk agreed this month to continue with the deal. Read the full article here. Former executives of Twitter who were fired after Musk bought Twitter have taken to the website to reflect on their experience working at the company. From former chief financial officer Ned Segal: Thursday concluded 5 years @twitter. I’m grateful for the opportunity to have worked with such an incredible group of people building the world’s town square for all of our stakeholders. The work isn’t complete, but we made meaningful progress. From former Twitter executive Patrick Pichette: Taking the words out of my mouth for the leadership team, but also all the Tweeps that have served by our side through the years. With Gratitude, Patrick https://t.co/bW0feRVpxi Correction: A previous version of this post implied that Ye’s visibility on Twitter was a new development since Musk’s takeover. In fact, the rapper was never banned from the platform – his account was locked and still visible. Following Musk’s takeover, speculation has begun how Ye, the rapper formally known as Kanye West, would engage with the platform following his suspension. The artist previously had his Twitter account locked last month amid antisemitic comments and outbursts he made, though it is unclear if Musk’s takeover had anything to do with Ye’s account being visible again. Ye’s remarks have cost the artist big, with several fashion and business associated with Ye vowing to never work with him again. Ye was also locked from Instagram, owned by Meta, due to the offensive comments and outbursts he made. The decision prompted Ye to tweet about his supposed friendship with Meta owner Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Cuban said today that he is happy with Musk’s Twitter takeover, calling the new owner a “ready, fire, aim entrepreneur”. Quite the fan, Cuban shared now-viral tweets about Musk’s leadership and entrepreneurial traits shortly after the acquisition was announced: I'm looking forward to the @elonmusk era on Twitter. He is a ready,fire,aim entrepreneur who will truly enjoy fucking with everyone who has an expectation of him. The only expectation you can have of @elonmusk is that he will flex his independence to show everyone who's in charge It's a unique asset that he will be able to take public the next time there is an insane bull market. He just needs to grow it profitably and he will make a killing Shortly after Musk’s takeover was announced, a bevy of anonymous Twitter profiles celebrated the purchase by espousing slurs and arguing that Twitter’s rules on hate speech did not apply. Musk has repeatedly said he will promote more free speech on Twitter, claiming that the current algorithm deprioritizes certain content with little regard. But Musk has pushed back against fears that the app will be less critical against bigotry and hate under his ownership. From the Washington Post: A wide range of anonymous Twitter accounts celebrated Musk’s takeover and argued it meant the old rules against bigotry no longer applied. “Elon now controls twitter. Unleash the racial slurs. K---S AND N-----S,” said one account, using slurs for Jews and Black people. “I can freely express how much I hate n-----s … now, thank you elon,” another said. In a tweeted letter Thursday, Musk had sought to soothe advertisers worried over the moderation changes by saying he did not want it to become a “free-for-all hellscape.” But the first hours of his purchase have shown how difficult that promise could be. One account, created this month, included a Nazi swastika as its profile picture and retweeted quotes from Musk alongside antisemitic memes. Another tweet, showing a video montage glorifying Nazi Germany with the comment, “I hear that there have been some changes around here,” was liked more than 400 times.

Our other main stories today: The US oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron have announced huge profits, dwarfing Shell’s $9.5bn. Texas-based ExxonMobil’s profits tripled to close to $20bn in the third quarter, nearly matching Apple’s profits, while Chevron was $11.2bn in the black. President Joe Biden blasted Exxon for making “more money than God” in the summer. Profits at the world’s biggest oil companies have soared to nearly £150bn so far this year as Russia’s war on Ukraine pushed up energy prices, according to estimates from analysts. The German economy surprised with growth of 0.3% in the July to September quarter, defying fears of a recession. It eked out 0.1% growth in the previous quarter. However, annual inflation in Europe’s biggest economy jumped to 11.6% last month, with food prices up 20%. Pre-tax profits at NatWest Group remained flat between July and September at £1.1bn, amid a worsening economic outlook and a cost of living squeeze on its customers, as the bank predicted UK house prices would fall by 7% next year. Airline revenues at British Airways’ owner have returned to pre-Covid levels, the group has announced, as it increased its profit forecasts despite a summer of disruption. Rail users have plenty of horror stories about their experiences and the train operator Avanti is on a deadline to fix its problems. The UK’s biggest gas storage site has been brought back in time for what could be one of the tightest winters for years for energy suppliers trying to meet demand. I am now handing over to our US team. Thank you for reading. – JK The SEC filing confirms that Elon Musk has taken over Twitter, and its shares have been taken off the New York stock exchange, reports our global technology editor Dan Milmo. The merger between Twitter, Inc. and X Holdings II, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of X Holdings I, Inc., wholly owned by Elon R. Musk became effective on October 27, 2022. Each share of Twitter, Inc. Common Stock was exchanged for USD 54.20 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. The Exchange also notifies the Securities and Exchange Commission that as a result of the above indicated conditions this security was suspended from trading before market open on October 28, 2022. Former US president Donald Trump said today he was happy Twitter was in “sane hands” as Elon Musk finalised the $44bn takeover, but did not say whether he would return to his account on the platform that banned him. Trump said he thought his own Truth Social media platform “looks and works better.” “I LOVE TRUTH,” Trump wrote in a post on his platform. Trump was banned from Twitter after the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Musk has said he would reinstate Trump’s account, but Trump previously said he would not return. Here’s our full story on reactions from senior politicians to the Twitter takeover. Senior politicians have warned Elon Musk over content moderation on Twitter, with the EU stressing the platform will “fly by our rules” and a UK minister expressing concerns over hate speech under the billionaire’s ownership. The EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, wrote on the platform on Friday that “in Europe, the bird will fly by our rules”, in response to Musk’s earlier tweet saying “the bird is freed” in apparent confirmation that he had bought the business. The EU is introducing the digital services act, which includes provisions for removal of illegal content including hate speech. The UK government flagged its own concerns on Friday, as the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey said it would be “concerning” if a relaxation of content moderation led to a proliferation on hate speech on the platform. “I think that would be concerning and it’s important that people have these platforms [and] use them responsibly rather than to promulgate hate speech,” she told Sky News. Coffey added that the online safety bill, a landmark piece of legislation tackling online hate speech, will return to parliament next week. However, it is understood that the bill will remain on pause after the government delayed its passage again this week. One internet safety campaigner said on Friday that the deal could “unravel” Twitter’s work on improving the platform, after reports that Musk has already fired the company’s head of legal policy, trust and safety, Vijaya Gadde. As the deal is finalised, Musk tweeted in the last hour: 🎶 let the good times roll 🎶 Twitter has filed for a delisting of its shares, as the $44bn takeover by Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, is finalised. Documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday show an application for the shares to be withdrawn from the New York stock exchange, as its new owner takes the company private. Researcher Joan Donovan recently looked at why the super-rich are buying social media sites? From Trump to Kanye and Musk. Tech CEOs have become the most crucial political gatekeepers in modern media history. Not by running for office – a cliche for today’s moneyed elite – but by using social media ownership as a proxy for political influence. It’s a trend years in the making. From the political largess of former Facebook executives like Sheryl Sandberg and Joel Kaplan to the metapolitics of Peter Thiel, tech titans have long adopted an inside/outside playbook for conducting politics by other means."

Governance Studies  
Race, Prosperity, and Inclusion Initiative  “The bird is freed,” tweeted Elon Musk on October 27, 2022, as a celebratory endnote to his acquisition of Twitter. However, this begs the question, free for which type of birds? By show of his previous political statements, current missteps, and future plans for the platform, this so-called freedom may simply galvanize extremists and further expose racial and religious minorities to hate speech and trauma. Twitter is now a major platform for proponents of hate speech. Twitter saw a nearly 500% increase in use of the N-word in the 12-hour window immediately following the shift of ownership to Musk. Within the following week, tweets including the word “Jew” had increased fivefold since before the ownership transfer. Tweets with the most engagement were overly antisemitic. Likewise, there has also been an uptick in misogynistic and transphobic language. This surge in hateful language has been accredited to various trolling campaigns on sites like 4chan and the pro-Trump forum “The Donald.” In response to these reports, Yoel Roth (former Head of Safety and Integrity at Twitter) posted a thread detailing that the majority of this derogatory language is coming from about 300 “inauthentic” accounts. Even if this hateful conduct is coming from a small number of troll accounts, this phenomenon speaks to how fringe, alt-right networks not only feel empowered by Musk’s takeover, but protected as well. Shortly after the acquisition, Musk laid off almost 50% of Twitter employees. He also fired several longtime executives including: CEO Parag Argrawal, CFO Ned Segal, chairman Bret Taylor, the company’s General Counsel, Sean Edgett, and the head of legal policy, trust, and safety, Vijaya Gadde. Gadde is especially of note because she was instrumental in banning former President Donald Trump from Twitter. After a Twitter poll with over 15 million votes (with 52% voting yes to return Trump to Twitter), Musk restored Trump to the platform. As a result, the team that was previously in place to monitor and censure hate speech is no longer at Twitter. As Musk is now the primary owner of the platform, he may follow through with loosening standards of harmful content and dissolving the so-called censorship he has criticized in the past. He plans to form a “Content Moderation Council,” and also changed how users are verified on the platform. He offered an $8/month verification process for the elusive blue Twitter check mark, in lieu of the traditional merit-based process that seemed to reward users based on number of followers and prominence in a particular field such as journalism, academia, or entertainment. This new verification process failed miserably and was pulled as users created fake accounts for companies and political leaders. One fake account actually led to Ely Lilly’s stock dropping over 4% and costing investors billions of dollars. While the verification process has dissolved for now, we are worried about potential changes to Twitter’s moderation process. When acquisitions of social media platforms occur, there should be an obligation of the new owner(s) to ensure that hate speech is moderated. This is even more vital given the current political environment and spread of misinformation. Some policymakers agree. In a bipartisan effort, Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis (D-WY) introduced the NUDGE Act (Nudging Users to Drive Good Experiences on Social Media) to provide funding for the National Science Foundation and the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to conduct a study on interventions that will reduce social media addiction and harmful language. In 2021, Democrats reintroduced the Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act “to hold large social media platforms accountable for their algorithmic amplification of harmful, radicalizing content that leads to offline violence.” Two research studies on Twitter speak to the importance of these potential policies. First, researchers analyzed political content on Twitter from Canada, France, Germany, Spain, Japan, Britain, and the United States. In six of the seven countries (Germany being the exception), right-wing political content received higher algorithmic amplification than left-wing content. Second, a report by The Brookings Institution examined over two million tweets and posts from Twitter and Reddit. Researchers found that users on Twitter, compared to Reddit users, were 2.5 times less likely to engage in bystander intervention to combat racist language. They attribute this difference to the divergent moderation policies on the two platforms. Reddit has a much more rigorous moderation policy to check and address hate speech on the platform. Conversely, Twitter is like the Wild Wild West and seems to be moving in a direction that may further marginalize people on the platform. Increasingly polarized politics and the prevalence of misinformation make this trend even more disconcerting. Some may claim that internet censorship and the de-platforming of people has no effect, but this is simply not the case. As an example, following the banning of Trump from Twitter and other social media sites, online engagement around Trump decreased by 95%. The presence of online misinformation regarding election fraud plunged by 73% following Trump’s Twitter ban. The ban of Andrew Tate may follow a similar trend. His removal from TikTok, where the algorithm connected him to millions of impressionable young boys, has effectively siphoned his violent reach. It is of course naïve to believe that de-platforming will completely halt the efforts of those so committed to bigotry. They are oftentimes pushed to more hidden and niche parts of the internet to spread their message. From Timothy McVeigh to Dylann Roof, we have evidence of what far-right extremists who are pushed further to the fringe can do. Collectively, recent changes to and at Twitter disrupt the ability of marginalized people to find community, produce useful discourse to share ways to foster equality, and protect themselves from hate speech and trauma. Musk’s acquisition of Twitter and his potential plans to loosen moderation guidelines will continue to increase the use of hate speech and likely inhibit the ways that marginalized groups have organized and mobilized on the platform to resist harmful language and discrimination in their everyday lives. Censoring hate speech and users who use hateful rhetoric are primary ways to ensure that the bird is truly free.

April 14 – Musk offers to buy Twitter at $54.20 per share, valuing the company at about $43 billion, according to a securities filing. The offer ...","Musk's acquisition of the social media company has been mired in controversy. The richest person in the world said he wanted to own one of the most popular social media platforms -- until he said he didn't. In early October, he reversed course again, saying he wanted to complete the deal. On Oct. 28, he finally did. Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed the deal to acquire Twitter at his original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion. In the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. The changes at Twitter mark the latest chapter in a monthslong saga that began in January when Musk started investing in the social media company. Musk reached an acquisition deal with Twitter in April, but over the ensuing weeks, he raised concerns over spam accounts on the platform, claiming Twitter had not provided him with an accurate estimate of their number. Twitter rebuked that claim, saying it has provided Musk with information in accordance with conditions set out in the acquisition deal. In May, when Musk said the deal was on ""temporary hold"" over bot concerns, Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at Wedbush, an investment firm, told ABC News the grievance could serve as a pretext for Musk to renegotiate or abandon the deal amid a market downturn that had proven especially pronounced for tech stocks. Over the course of the saga, Musk has been cast as a suitor, critic and legal adversary of Twitter, where he boasts 115 million followers. Below is a timeline of Musk's bid to acquire the social media platform, and what has happened since he took ownership. Late January – Musk begins investing in Twitter, according to information filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in April. March 14 – Musk's stake in Twitter reaches 9.2%, making him the largest shareholder in the company, according to a securities filing. April 4 – In a securities filing, Musk discloses his stake in Twitter. Based on the price of Twitter shares at close of the previous trading day, his stake was worth $2.89 billion. Twitter shares rise more than 27% on the announcement. April 5 – Twitter announces Musk will join the company's board of directors. ""He's both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service which is exactly what we need on @Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the long-term,"" Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal said on the platform. ""Welcome Elon!""  April 10 – Musk says he will not join the Twitter board after all. ""There will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged,"" Agrawal said in a statement announcing Musk's choice. ""The decisions we make and how we make them remain in our hands, no one else's."" April 14 – Musk offers to buy Twitter at $54.20 per share, valuing the company at about $43 billion, according to a securities filing. The offer amounts to a 38% premium above where the price stood a day before Musk's investment in Twitter became public. ""I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,"" Musk said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company."" April 15 – Twitter adopts a poison pill provision to prevent the Musk acquisition. A poison pill allows current stockholders to purchase additional shares at a discounted price, diluting the shares owned by Musk and making it more expensive for him to buy the company. In an announcement, Twitter said the poison pill will be triggered if any individual or entity acquires at least 15% of the company's shares. April 21 – Musk says in a securities filing that he has garnered commitments of about $46.5 billion in financing for a possible Twitter acquisition. April 25 – Twitter accepts Musk's offer to acquire the company and values the deal at $44 billion, according to an announcement from the company.  April 29 – Over a three-day period after Musk and Twitter reach a deal, and he sells about $8.5 billion worth in Tesla stock to help finance the bid. May 4 – Musk secures more than $7 billion in financing for the deal, including commitments from Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, venture capital firm Sequoia Capital and cryptocurrency exchange Binance, according to a securities filing. May 6 – In a pitch deck for investors, Musk says he will quintuple Twitter's revenue by 2028, increasing annual earnings to $26.4 billion, the New York Times reports. May 10 – Musk says he would reverse Twitter's ban of the account that belongs to former President Donald Trump. The remarks from Musk were made virtually at an auto conference. May 12 – Twitter announces a temporary hiring freeze, pending Musk's acquisition; and two top executives leave the company. May 13 – Musk tweets that the Twitter deal is ""temporarily on hold,"" ​​citing concern over what he says is the prevalence of bot and spam accounts on the platform. Along with his tweet, Musk posts a Reuters report about a public filing from Twitter earlier in May that said fake accounts made up less than 5% of users on the platform. Apparently skeptical of the finding, Musk says he wants ""details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users."" Roughly two hours later, Musk says he's ""still committed"" to the deal. At the time, market analysts told ABC News the worry over fake accounts could serve as a pretext for Musk to bargain a lower price for the acquisition or abandon the effort altogether. May 26 – Twitter shareholders bring a class-action lawsuit against Musk over alleged stock manipulation tied to the tumultuous acquisition process. At the time, Twitter's stock had fallen more than 12% since Musk announced his bid. June 6 – Musk threatens to pull out of the deal if Twitter doesn't provide additional information about the prevalence of bots on its platform. In a statement, Twitter said it had been sharing information with Musk ""in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.""  July 8 – Musk moves to terminate his acquisition of Twitter, pointing to the issue of fake accounts. ""Mr. Musk has sought the data and information necessary to 'make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter's platform'"" and did not receive it, a securities filing said. In an email on disclosed in a securities filing on Sunday, an attorney representing Twitter rejected Musk's effort to abandon the acquisition. ""The purported termination is invalid,"" the attorney wrote, arguing that Musk had ""knowingly, intentionally, willfully, and materially breached the Agreement."" ""As it has done, Twitter will continue to provide information reasonably requested by Mr. Musk under the Agreement,"" the attorneys added. July 12 – Twitter sues Musk in Chancery Court in Delaware to force him to complete the deal. ""Musk refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests,"" Twitter said in the lawsuit. ""Musk apparently believes that he — unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law — is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away."" Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. If permitted to abandon the deal, Musk may be forced to pay a $1 billion termination fee. July 19 – A Delaware court determines that the trial in a lawsuit brought by Twitter against Elon Musk should take place in October, granting an expedited timeline for the case. Aug. 23 – News breaks that former Twitter Head of Security Peiter Zatko alleged in a federal whistleblower complaint that the social media giant had numerous wide-ranging information security system lapses, according to a copy of the complaint made public. In response, Twitter blasted Zatko, who worked at the company from November 2020 to January 2022, saying he was spreading a ""false narrative about Twitter"" and was fired for ""ineffective leadership and poor performance."" Oct. 4 – Musk proposes the completion of a deal to acquire Twitter, reversing a monthslong effort to terminate the agreement. The proposal would complete the deal at Musk's original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion, a person familiar with the proposal told ABC News.  Oct. 28 – Musk closes a deal to acquire Twitter on the final day before the Delaware Chancery Court trial would have moved forward. Some of Twitter's top executives were fired, including CEO Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, chief legal officer Vijaya Gadde and general counsel Sam Edgett, according to a source. Musk said that he will forgo any significant content moderation or account reinstatement decisions until after the formation of a new committee devoted to the issues. ""Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints,"" Musk tweeted. ""No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes."" Nov. 4  – Twitter begins layoffs that will cut roughly half of its 7,500-person workforce, the company announced in an email. ""Today is your last working day at the company,"" the email said, which ABC News has reviewed. The subject line read ""Your Role at Twitter"" and was sent to the personal email addresses of those laid off. Nov. 9  – Twitter launches a new version of its subscription service, Twitter Blue, which allows users to access verification if they pay a monthly fee of $8. Previously, the company verified celebrities, politicians, journalists and prominent figures on a case-by-case basis in an effort to prevent impersonation. To address impostors, Musk says the site will permanently suspend users who attempt to impersonate others, unless the account is clearly marked as a parody. Nov. 10  – A flood of fake accounts impersonating public figures and brands on Twitter after the launch of paid verification badges prompts the company to reinstate a second layer of ""official"" tags, the company said. Impostor accounts posed as a slew of well-known people and companies, including basketball star LeBron James, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, gaming company Nintendo of America and even Tesla, the electric vehicle maker run by Twitter's owner, Musk. Nov. 11  – Twitter Blue appears to be unavailable on the company's Apple iOS app for some users. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News          Twitter on Friday laid off thousands of employees in departments across the company, in a severe round of cost cutting that could potentially upend how one of the world’s most influential platforms operates one week after it was acquired by billionaire Elon Musk. 
   
      Numerous Twitter employees began posting on the platform Thursday night and Friday morning that they had already been locked out of their company email accounts ahead of the planned layoff notification. Some also shared blue hearts and salute emojis indicating they were out at the company. 
   
Elon Musk said Twitter has seen a 'massive drop in revenue' as more brands pause ads        By Friday morning, Twitter employees from departments including ethical AI, marketing and communication, search, public policy, wellness and other teams had tweeted about having been let go. Members of the curation team, which help elevate reliable information on the platform, including about elections, were also laid off, according to employee posts.  
   
      “Just got remotely logged out of my work laptop and removed from Slack,” one Twitter employee said on the platform. “So sad it had to end this way.” 
   
      Another employee said that she and other members of Twitter’s human rights team had been laid off. The employee added that she is proud of the team’s work “to protect those at-risk in global conflicts & crises including Ethiopia, Afghanistan, and Ukraine, and to defend the needs of those particularly at risk of human rights abuse by virtue of their social media presence, such as journalists & human rights defenders.”
   
      Simon Balmain, a former Twitter senior community manager who was laid off Friday, said in an interview with CNN that he lost access to Slack, email and other internal systems around 8 hours before receiving an email Friday morning officially notifying him that he’d been fired. He added that the lay off email “still didn’t provide any details really” about why he’d been let go.
   
      “The waves of annoyance and frustration and all that stuff are absolutely mitigated by the extreme solidarity we’ve seen from people that are in the company, people that are in the same position, people that left the company in years gone by,” Balmain said. “It’s like a giant support network, which has been absolutely amazing.”   
   
      One Twitter employee who was laid off told CNN Friday that some workers are relieved to have been let go. “For me, being safe would’ve been punishment,” the employee said. 
   
      While Twitter employees were posting about being laid off, Musk on Friday appeared for a friendly interview at an investor conference and spoke about making cheaper electric vehicles and his ambitions to go to Mars. During the interview, Musk said of Twitter, “I tried to get out of the deal,” but then added, “I think there is a tremendous amount of potential … and I think it could be one of the most valuable companies in the world.” 
   
      The interviewer said that Musk had laid off “half of Twitter” and Musk nodded, although he did not comment on the remark. 
   
      (In a series of tweets Friday evening, Yoel Roth, head of Twitter’s trust and safety team, confirmed overall headcount was cut by roughly 50%. The layoffs eliminated 15% of the company’s trust and safety team, leading to reductions in customer service but little change to content moderation, according to Roth. )
   
      In his interview, Musk appeared to frame the sweeping layoffs as necessary for a company that, like other social media firms, was experiencing “revenue challenges” prior to his acquisition as advertisers rethink spending amid recession fears. 
   
      Musk also said “a number of major advertisers have stopped spending on Twitter” in the days since the acquisition was completed. 
   
      Twitter had about 7,500 workers prior to Musk’s takeover, meaning roughly 3,700 employees were laid off. The cuts come as Musk attempts to improve the company’s bottom line after taking out significant debt financing to fund his $44 billion acquisition.
   
      The email sent Thursday evening notified employees that they would receive a notice by 12 p.m. ET Friday that informs them of their employment status.
   
      “If your employment is not impacted, you will receive a notification via your Twitter email,” a copy of the email obtained by CNN said. “If your employment is impacted, you will receive a notification with next steps via your personal email.”
   
      The email added that “to help ensure the safety” of employees and Twitter’s systems, the company’s offices “will be temporarily closed and all badge access will be suspended.”
   
      The email concluded acknowledging that it will be “an incredibly challenging experience to go through” for the workforce.
   
      Several Twitter employees on Thursday night filed a class action lawsuit alleging that Twitter is in violation of the federal and California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN Act) after laying off some employees already. The complaint was later amended to acknowledge that while several of the plaintiffs did ultimately receive sufficient notice of their termination under the WARN Act, Twitter still allegedly failed to give sufficient notice in the case of some employees.
   
      The WARN Act requires that an employer with more than 100 employees must provide 60 days’ advanced written notice prior to a mass layoff “affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment.” 
   
      “Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, has made clear that he believes complying with federal labor laws is ‘trivial,’” Attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan, who filed the lawsuit, said in a statement to CNN. “We have filed this federal complaint to ensure that Twitter be held accountable to our laws and to prevent Twitter employees from unknowingly signing away their rights.” 
   
      WARN notices were filed by Twitter on Friday for nearly 1,000 impacted employees at the company’s various California offices. 
   
      Separately, other labor lawyers told CNN Friday they had begun receiving inquiries from Twitter employees questioning whether their terminations may have been unlawfully discriminatory or retaliatory. 
   
      “Former Twitter employees have reached out to us regarding their layoffs and their circumstances, and so we’re looking at all the issues — beyond appropriate notice — and to make sure the employee wasn’t laid off due to their membership in a protected category,” said Chauniqua Young, a partner at the law firm Outten & Golden.
   
      Beyond the potential for lawsuits arising from the layoffs, other legal experts say Musk’s handling of the cuts may well create further problems for him down the road — whether in terms of attracting future talent or by keeping remaining workers satisfied. 
   
      “Once you treat people like this, they remember that,” said Terri Gerstein, a fellow at Harvard Law School’s Labor and Worklife Program and Economic Policy Institute. “Of the people remaining, it is a certainty that none of them feel secure in their job, and I would be shocked if the remaining people were not updating their resumes right now or talking with each other about starting a union.”
   
      Musk started his tenure at Twitter by firing CEO Parag Agrawal and two other executives, according to two people familiar with the decision.
   
      And in less than a week since Musk acquired the company, its C-suite appears to have almost entirely cleared out, through a mix of firings and resignations. Musk has also dissolved Twitter’s former board of directors.
   
      Many staffers on Friday summed up their feelings with a hashtag, #LoveWhereYouWorked, a past-tense play on one previously often used by Twitter employees.

Elon Musk sold $3.95 billion worth of Tesla stock since completing his purchase of Twitter late last month.","Markets   
Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News          Elon Musk sold $3.95 billion worth of Tesla stock since completing his purchase of Twitter late last month.
   
      Musk’s Tesla stock sales, totaling 19.5 million shares, have been widely anticipated ever since the Tesla CEO reached a deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion. Musk had sold blocks of Tesla shares worth a total of $15.4 billion earlier this year since his deal to buy Twitter was announced.
   
      Twitter confirmed Musk bought the social media company October 27, but he waited until November 4 to start selling additional Tesla shares. He also sold blocks of Tesla stock on Monday and Tuesday this week, according to filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission late Tuesday night. 
   
      It’s not clear if the money Musk raised went toward the Twitter purchase, or to support losses at Twitter since he took over. 
   
      Musk disclosed last week that Twitter has seen a “massive drop in revenue,” as a growing number of advertisers pause spending on the platform in the wake of his takeover of the company. He blamed “activist groups” pressuring advertisers for the loss of ad dollars. 
   
      Twitter lost $270 million in the quarter ending June 30, well before Musk took over and advertisers began to flee. It had only $2.7 billion of cash on hand on its balance sheet as of June 30. He has announced plans to charge users $8 a month to have verified accounts, and also announced deep staff cuts.
   
      Musk’s two weeks of ownership of Twitter have been a “debacle of epic proportions,” said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities. Although it’s possible that the money from Musk’s sale of Twitter sales the last two week may have gone toward paying off some short-term financing used to close the Twitter deal, it can’t be ruled out that it was made necessary by big losses at Twitter.
   
      “The more he gets into Twitter, the more it becomes a quicksand type of deal,” said Ives.
   
      This is not the best time to be selling Tesla shares, which have lost 46% of their value so far this year on disappointing sales caused by supply chain problems. Musk received an average price of  $202.52 for the Tesla shares he sold since the Twitter deal closed, which is down 10% just since he closed on his deal to buy Twitter. 
   
      Shares of Tesla
            
                (TSLA) fell 1.5% in premarket trading Wednesday.
   
      The company is facing growing competition in the electric vehicle market from established automakers such as Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors. And some investors have expressed concerns that Musk will be too distracted by his purchase of Twitter to give enough attention to addressing Tesla’s problems.
   
      “Tesla investors are exacerbated by this never ending Twitter albatross,” said Ives. “Musk needs to look in the mirror and end this constant merry-go-round of Twitter overhang on the Tesla story with his focus back on the golden child Tesla which needs his time more than ever.”
   
      These three most recent blocks of Tesla stock sales represent only 4% of the shares that Musk owns outright through a trust, and less than 3% of his holdings if options that he has to buy additional shares are included.
   
      Musk agreed to buy Twitter
            
                (TWTR) in April, shortly after filings showed he had purchased 73 million shares, or about a 9% stake, for $2.6 billion. The purchases made him the company’s largest shareholder.
   
      Soon after the deal was announced, he disclosed he had sold $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares, a move seen as a first step to raise the cash he would need to complete the purchase of Twitter.
   
Elon Musk's wrecking ball is hard at work inside Twitter        Even after Musk announced a change of heart and fought a lawsuit brought by Twitter to force him to buy the company, he continued to sell Tesla shares. Filings in August showed he had sold an additional $6.9 billion worth of Tesla shares.
   
      Musk’s filings did not disclose the reason for those earlier stock sales. But after someone on Twitter asked him if he was done selling Tesla shares, he responded “Yes” and then pointed to the possibility of being forced to buy Twitter as the reason for those sales.
   
      Since Musk’s earlier Tesla sales, shares of Tesla have split three-for-one, meaning he needed to sell three times as many shares in order to raise as much cash. But his holdings of Tesla shares also tripled due to the split.
   
      Before his interest in Twitter, Musk rarely sold shares of Tesla stock, primarily selling shares necessary to pay taxes when exercising stock options. 
   
      He sold a total of 15.7 million pre-split shares at the end of 2021, netting a total of $16.4 billion, because he had to exercise stock options or risk having them expire. He likely ended up with a tax bill of more than $10 billion. But even after paying that tax bill and the cost to exercise those options, he likely had roughly $5 billion left over. He may have used some of that cash to buy his initial Twitter stake.
   
      These latest sales represent the lowest price at which Musk has sold Tesla shares recently, off about 30% from his sales in April and August when adjusted for the Tesla stock split since then, and down 42% from what he received when he sold shares in late 2021.

The meeting marks a significant de-escalation days after Musk went on a tweet storm accusing Apple of threatening to pull the Twitter app from the App Store and posted then deleted a meme that suggested he would rather ""go to war"" than pay Apple's 30% platform fees. ""Good conversation. Among other things, we resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store,"" Musk tweeted. ""Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so."" In another tweet, Musk posted a short video of a reflecting pool at the center of Apple Park in Cupertino, California. On Monday, Musk posted several tweets criticizing Apple and arguing that its App Store moderation policies were against the spirit of free speech, a complaint subsequently echoed by Republican lawmakers. Over the weekend, he mused that he may make his own smartphone. Musk also chafed against Apple's fees, which take between 15% and 30% of digital sales through apps on iPhones. Apple stands to make money from Twitter if Musk succeeds in his plan to significantly expand Twitter subscription revenue, and those features are sold through the Twitter iPhone app. ""Did you know Apple puts a secret 30% tax on everything you buy through their App Store?"" Musk tweeted on Monday. He also tagged Cook's Twitter account on Monday and asked what was going on with a potential suspension of the Twitter app. Apple representatives did not respond to requests for comment.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63648505,Elon Musk tells Twitter staff to work long hours or leave - BBC News,20221101,"Nov 17, 2022 ... Elon Musk tells Twitter staff to work long hours or leave ... Elon Musk seen through the Twitter logo. ... Elon Musk has told Twitter staff that ...","Elon Musk has told Twitter staff that they must commit to working ""long hours at high intensity"" or else leave the company, according to reports. In an email to staff, the social media firm's new owner said workers should agree to the pledge if they wanted to stay, the Washington Post reported. Those who do not sign up by Thursday will be given three months' severance pay, Mr Musk said. The BBC has contacted Twitter for comment. In his email to staff, also seen by The Guardian, Mr Musk said that Twitter ""will need to be extremely hardcore"" in order to succeed. ""This will mean working long hours at high intensity. Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade,"" he said. Workers were told that they needed to click on a link by 17:00 EST on Thursday, if they want to be ""part of the new Twitter"". He added: ""Whatever decision you make, thank you for your efforts to make Twitter successful."" The world's richest man has already announced half of Twitter's staff are being let go, after he bought the company in a $44bn (£38.7bn) deal. Mr Musk said he had ""no choice"" over the cuts, as the company was losing $4m (£3.51m) a day. He has blamed ""activist groups pressuring advertisers"" for a ""massive drop in revenue"". A host of top Twitter executives have also stepped down following his purchase of the firm. Last week, the entrepreneur told Twitter staff that remote working would end and ""difficult times"" lay ahead, according to reports. In an email to staff, the owner of the social media firm said workers would be expected in the office for at least 40 hours a week, Bloomberg reported. Mr Musk added that there was ""no way to sugar-coat the message"" that the slowing global economy was going to hit Twitter's advertising revenues. But tech investor Sarah Kunst said the real reason Twitter is facing difficulties is because Mr Musk's takeover has saddled the company with debt.  His behaviour since the takeover has also led some advertisers to pause their spending, she said.  ""He's now trying to inflict that pain and uncertainty on the employees,"" she said. She added that there was a question mark over how enforceable Mr Musk's email about hours to staff really was. ""Can you just send an email to staff who already work for you and just unilaterally change their working contract? That remains to be seen."" Elon Musk likes to think of himself as ""hardcore"".  He says he works 100+ hour weeks. He sometimes sleeps at the office.  And he wants that for his staff too.  His management philosophy is about putting together small collections of highly motivated and capable employees.  He says he'd much rather have a small number of exceptional people than many who are ""pretty good and moderately motivated"".  With this email, he appears to applying that philosophy. He wants just true believers at Twitter, people who are fully aligned with what he's doing.  There are plenty of staff who do believe in Twitter's mission. There are also staff working for Twitter who will relish working closely with Mr Musk.  But his directives to staff feel at times autocratic. The danger is he loses top staff by appearing cavalier and arrogant.  And of course, if everyone at Twitter decided to take Elon Musk's offer of severance at once, it's hard to see how Twitter could function in the short term.  Mr Musk himself has been sleeping at Twitter in recent weeks, even while leading electric carmaker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX. He described his work habits in a US court on Wednesday, where he appeared to defend the eye-popping $56bn pay package he received from electric carmaker Tesla in 2018. ""I pretty much work all the time, with rare exceptions."" he said.  In response to questioning, he later added that the ""fundamental organisational restructuring"" at Twitter would be complete by the end of this week. One way Mr Musk could lighten his workload is by sharing the leadership of his other companies.  At the hearing, James Murdoch, a Tesla director and the son of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, said that Mr Musk had identified a potential successor to head the car maker. Asked to confirm that Mr Musk had never identified a potential new Tesla chief executive, Mr Murdoch said ""he actually has"", adding that it had happened in the ""last few months"". He didn't identify who the potential successor was. Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that Twitter's culture had ""dramatically changed"" with Mr Musk at the helm. ""Elon Musk is not going to be doing candlelight dinners and playing ping pong in Twitter's cafeteria and this is a shock to the system,"" he said. ""But he also needs to play nice in the sandbox because if key Twitter engineers and developers leave, this will be a major void in the Twitter ecosystem,"" he warned. ""There's a careful balance ahead for him, in this tightrope act."" Do you work long hours either willingly or because you feel you have no choice?

Elon Musk said on Wednesday he expects a wireless brain chip developed by his company Neuralink to begin human clinical trials in six months ...","Nov 30 (Reuters) - Elon Musk said on Wednesday he expects a wireless brain chip developed by his company Neuralink to begin human clinical trials in six months, after the company missed earlier timelines set by him. The company is developing brain chip interfaces that it says could help disabled patients to move and communicate again, with Musk adding on Wednesday it will also target restoring vision. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin, Texas, Neuralink has in recent years been conducting tests on animals as it seeks approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin clinical trials in people. ""We want to be extremely careful and certain that it will work well before putting a device into a human,"" Musk said during a much-awaited public update on the device. Speaking to a crowd of select invitees in a presentation at Neuralink headquarters that lasted nearly three hours, Musk emphasized the speed at which the company is developing its device. ""The progress at first, particularly as it applies to humans, will seem perhaps agonizingly slow, but we are doing all of the things to bring it to scale in parallel,"" he added. ""So, in theory, progress should be exponential."" The FDA said it cannot comment on the status or the existence of any potential product applications. The first two human applications targeted by the Neuralink device will be in restoring vision and enabling movement of muscles in people who cannot do so, Musk said. ""Even if someone has never had vision, ever, like they were born blind, we believe we can still restore vision,"" he said. Tesla Inc. founder Elon Musk speaks at the unveiling event by ""The Boring Company"" for the test tunnel of a proposed underground transportation network across Los Angeles County, in Hawthorne, California, U.S. December 18, 2018.  Robyn Beck/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights The event was originally planned for Oct. 31 but Musk postponed it just days before without giving a reason. Neuralink’s last public presentation, more than a year ago, involved a monkey with a brain chip that played a computer game by thinking alone.  read more  Musk, who also runs electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla (TSLA.O), rocket firm SpaceX, and social media platform Twitter, is known for lofty goals such as colonizing Mars and saving humanity. His ambitions for Neuralink, which he launched in 2016, are of the same grand scale. He wants to develop a chip that would allow the brain to control complex electronic devices and eventually allow people with paralysis to regain motor function and treat brain diseases such as Parkinson's, dementia and Alzheimer's. He also talks of melding the brain with artificial intelligence. Neuralink, however, is running behind schedule. Musk said in a 2019 presentation he was aiming to receive regulatory approval by the end of 2020. He then said at a conference in late 2021 that he hoped to start human trials this year. Neuralink has repeatedly missed internal deadlines to gain FDA approval to start human trials, current and former employees have said. Musk approached competitor Synchron earlier this year about a potential investment after he expressed frustration to Neuralink employees about their slow progress, Reuters reported in August. Synchron crossed a major milestone in July by implanting its device in a patient in the United States for the first time. It received U.S. regulatory clearance for human trials in 2021 and has completed studies in four people in Australia.

On April 5, Musk discloses he has purchased more than 9% of Twitter's shares on the open market. At first, he is offered a board ..."," Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time A lot has happened since Elon Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter last month — layoffs of thousands of employees, firings of engineers critical of him and an impersonation of an official Eli Lilly account that caused the pharmaceutical company's stock to drop.   It's all part of the chaotic saga that began this spring, when Musk first put in motion a plan to take control of the social media platform.  Here’s a complete timeline of what’s happened so far. On April 5, Musk discloses he has purchased more than 9% of Twitter's shares on the open market. At first, he is offered a board seat. That plan quickly falls through — and Twitter decides to adopt a poison-pill strategy to fend off a hostile takeover from Musk. Musk subsequently makes an offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share, or about $44 billion — a price well above the company's stock price at the time. He says his goal is to apply free speech principles to the platform, which he claimed had been mismanaged. ""The company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form,"" he writes. ""Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company."" ""Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it,"" he adds. Musk says he would fund the deal through a combination of cash and borrowing. At this point, shares in Musk's automotive company, Tesla, begin to decline; by mid-November, they will have lost close to half their value. By April 25, Twitter decides to accept Musk's offer.  “The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon’s proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing,” Twitter’s Independent Board Chair Bret Taylor says in a statement. “The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter’s stockholders.” On May 13, Musk tweets he is putting the deal to acquire Twitter ""temporarily on hold"" pending additional information about the volume of fake and spam accounts on the platform.  That's despite regular disclosures by Twitter stretching back years featuring its estimates that less than 5% of the accounts on the site were fraudulent. Although Musk subsequently says he is still committed to the deal, he continues to make public statements about problems he saw at Twitter.  In response, Twitter issues a statement saying Musk already agreed to the $54.20 transaction and that it intended to close on and enforce the merger agreement.  Musk continues to accuse Twitter of covering up the volume of bot and spam accounts on the site and failing to respond to requests for information about the issue.  “Mr. Musk has made it clear that he does not believe the company’s lax testing methodologies are adequate so he must conduct his own analysis,” Musk's attorney says in a filing. “The data he has requested is necessary to do so.” Twitter denies the claims and continues to forge ahead with the deal. On June 16, the company invites Musk to an all-hands meeting, which Musk attended remotely. It augurs the sea change in the company culture that would eventually sweep over the business once Musk finally takes it over.  Unable to come to an agreement over the bots issue, Twitter sues Musk in Delaware court to enforce the $44 billion deal.  “Musk’s conduct simply confirms that he wants to escape the binding contract he freely signed, and to damage Twitter in the process,” the company says. Musk ultimately countersues, once again accusing Twitter of fraud — allegations it denies. A trial date is set for Oct. 17 in Delaware.  Seemingly unrelated to the acquisition, a former Twitter employee files a whistleblower complaint alleging lax operational security practices at Twitter; the complaint is revealed in August. He testifies before a Senate committee in September that Twitter was “a decade behind industry security standards.” “It’s not far-fetched to say that an employee in the company could take over the accounts of all of the senators in this room,” he says.  In the meantime, Musk and Twitter jockey for position ahead of the October trial — with Judge Kathaleen McCormick increasingly siding with Twitter in key pre-trial motions. As the trial approaches and markets increasingly predict a verdict in favor of Twitter, Musk says he will resubmit his bid to acquire the company for $54.20 if Twitter agrees to head off a trial. Twitter declines to do so, but Judge McCormick decides to give the two sides until the end of the month to hammer out an agreement.  As the deal nears, The Washington Post reports Musk intends to lay off massive numbers of employees after the acquisition is complete. Though Twitter's general counsel tells workers not to believe what it called ""rumors,"" those job cuts come swiftly after Musk's takeover and total about half of Twitter's payroll. Musk also writes a note to advertisers pledging Twitter will not become a “free-for-all hellscape.”  On Oct. 28, Musk officially consummates the acquisition, takes over Twitter and promptly fires key executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal and policy director Vijaya Gadde.  Musk's arrival is notably hailed by libertarians and right-leaning pundits. Within 48 hours of taking over, Musk tweets, then deletes, an unfounded, anti-LGBTQ conspiracy theory about the Paul Pelosi attack. A week after Musk’s takeover, far-right figures begin to test Twitter’s boundaries for anti-LGBTQ speech. Despite stating that he had not made substantive changes to Twitter's content moderation policies, advertisers say they will pull back amid ""uncertainty"" about his new strategy.  On Nov. 4, NBC News reports that employees who helped fight misinformation were ultimately among those laid off.  Musk also launches plans to begin charging users $7.99 for access to Twitter Blue, a service that included the platform's blue-checkmark verification. In the next two days, the site is flooded with users who bought blue checkmarks only to turn around and impersonate official accounts, including Musk's. In one instance, a user pretending to be the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly tweets that the company's insulin products would now be free, causing the real company's stock to briefly fall.  As impersonators continue to spread, Musk decides to suspend the rollout of the new Twitter Blue program. Meanwhile, Twitter engineers become increasingly vocal about the changes being made by Musk. In response, Musk fires one engineer, then terminates as many as 20 others, including ones who'd criticized him on internal channels.    On Nov. 16, Musk sends a companywide email to remaining employees demanding they commit to working “long hours at high intensity” or receive “three months of severance,” if they did not consent to these conditions or support his vision for “Twitter 2.0.” Rob Wile is a breaking business news reporter for NBC News Digital. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Half of Twitter's top 100 advertisers appear to no longer be advertising on the website. Half of Twitter's top 100 advertisers appear to no longer be advertising on the website. A report from Media Matters for America states that these 50 advertisers have spent almost $2 billion on Twitter ads since 2020 and more than $750 million just in 2022. Seven additional advertisers have slowed their advertising to almost nothing, according to the report, which was published on Tuesday. These companies have paid Twitter more than $255 million since 2020. Chevrolet, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Ford, Jeep, Kyndryl, Merck & Co. and Novartis AG all issued statements about halting Twitter ads or were reported and confirmed as doing so. The others ceased advertising on the platform for a ""significant period of time following direct outreach, controversies, and warnings from media buyers."" The report wrote that even with these hits to advertising revenue, Twitter CEO Elon Musk has ""continued his rash of brand unsafe actions — including amplifying conspiracy theories, unilaterally reinstating banned accounts such as that of former President Donald Trump, courting and engaging with far-right accounts, and instituting a haphazard verification scheme that allowed extremists and scammers to purchase a blue check."" Twitter users like author Stephen King have criticized the new blue checkmark system. The symbol used to verify the identity of Twitter accounts, so it was easy to confirm a tweet's source. Eli Lilly and Co. stopped showing ads on Twitter the day after an account impersonating the pharmaceutical company — complete with a purchased blue check mark — posted, ""We are excited to announce insulin is free now."" Eli Lilly asked Twitter to take it down, but the tweet remained up for hours, because the platform's staff was stretched thin due to recent layoffs and resignations. The tweet garnered hundreds of retweets and thousands of likes, and Eli Lilly's stock soon took a dive. Endpoints News reported that 12 pharmaceutical giants soon stopped buying Twitter ads, citing Pathmatics, which collects data on corporate advertising and digital marketing trends. King quipped on Twitter, ""Pretty soon the only advertiser left on Twitter will be My Pillow."" The pillow-manufacturing company is run by pro-Trump conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell.

Hundreds of Twitter Inc employees are estimated to have decided to quit the beleaguered social media company following a Thursday deadline ...","Nov 18 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Twitter Inc employees are estimated to have decided to quit the beleaguered social media company following a Thursday deadline from new owner Elon Musk that staffers sign up for ""long hours at high intensity,"" or leave. The departures highlight the reluctance of some of Twitter's 3,000 or so employees to remain at a company where Musk earlier fired half of the workforce including top management, and is ruthlessly changing the culture to emphasize long hours and an intense pace. Musk took to Twitter late on Thursday and said that he was not worried about resignations as ""the best people are staying."" The billionaire owner also added: ""We just hit another all time high in Twitter usage...,"" without elaborating. Musk met some top employees on Thursday to try to convince them to stay, said one current employee and a recently departed employee who is in touch with Twitter colleagues. The company also notified employees that it will close its offices and cut badge access until Monday, according to two sources. Security officers began kicking some employees out of one office on Thursday evening, one source said. Over 110 Twitter employees across at least four continents had announced their decision to leave in public Twitter posts reviewed by Reuters, though each resignation could not be independently verified. About 15 employees, many in ad sales, posted their intention to stay at the company. In Twitter's internal chat tool, over 500 employees wrote farewell messages on Thursday, a source familiar with the notes said. A poll on the workplace app Blind, which verifies employees through their work email addresses and allows them to share information anonymously, had showed 42% of 180 respondents opting for ""Taking exit option, I'm free!"" A quarter said they had chosen to stay ""reluctantly,"" and only 7% of the poll participants said they ""clicked yes to stay, I'm hardcore."" The exact number of employees intending to leave the company could not be immediately established. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. The departures include many engineers responsible for fixing bugs and preventing service outages, raising questions about the stability of the platform amid the loss of employees. [1/3]A woman walks past the Twitter offices in New York City, U.S., November 9, 2022. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid  Acquire Licensing Rights On Thursday evening, the version of the Twitter app used by employees began slowing down, according to one source familiar with the matter, who estimated that the public version of Twitter was at risk of breaking during the night. ""If it does break, there is no one left to fix things in many areas,"" the person said, who declined to be named for fear of retribution. Reports of Twitter outages rose sharply from less than 50 to about 350 reports on Thursday evening, according to website Downdetector, which tracks website and app outages. In a private chat on Signal with about 50 Twitter staffers, nearly 40 said they had decided to leave, according to the former employee. And in a private Slack group for Twitter's current and former employees, about 360 people joined a new channel titled ""voluntary-layoff,"" said a person with knowledge of the Slack group. A separate poll on Blind asked staffers to estimate what percentage of people would leave Twitter based on their perception. More than half of respondents estimated at least 50% of employees would leave. Early on Wednesday, Musk had emailed Twitter employees, saying: ""Going forward, to build a breakthrough Twitter 2.0 and succeed in an increasingly competitive world, we will need to be extremely hardcore"". The email asked staff to click ""yes"" if they wanted to stick around. Those who did not respond by 5 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday would be considered to have quit and given a severance package, the email said. As the deadline approached, employees scrambled to figure out what to do. One team within Twitter decided to take the leap together and leave the company, one employee who is leaving told Reuters. Blue hearts and salute emojis flooded Twitter and its internal chatrooms on Thursday, the second time in two weeks as Twitter employees said their goodbyes. Notable departures included Tess Rinearson, who was tasked with building a cryptocurrency team at Twitter. Rinearson tweeted the blue heart and salute emojis. In an apparent jab at Musk's call for employees to be ""hardcore,"" the Twitter profile bios of several departing engineers on Thursday described themselves as ""softcore engineers"" or ""ex-hardcore engineers."" As the resignations rolled in, Musk cracked a joke on Twitter. ""How do you make a small fortune in social media?"" he tweeted. ""Start out with a large one.""

According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission published Tuesday, Musk sold 19.5 million more shares of Tesla. Musk sold almost $22 billion worth of Tesla shares in 2021, a year when the stock jumped over 50%. This year, he sold over $8 billion worth of stock in April and roughly $7 billion worth in August. In addition to pouring billions of his own capital into taking Twitter private, the Tesla CEO relied on partners, including equity investors Binance, Ron Baron's BAMCO, Andreessen Horowitz, Twitter's former CEO Jack Dorsey and Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia, to finance the deal, or to roll their existing shares into his holding company for Twitter. As NBC News previously reported, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn) has called for an investigation into the national security implications of Saudi Arabia's stake in Twitter following Musk's take-private deal. On Aug. 9, Musk told fans he was done selling Tesla shares to fund a possible Twitter acquisition. He wrote, in a tweet, ""In the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close *and* some equity partners don't come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock."" At the time, Musk was still battling the social media company in court to try to get out of the deal — which he proposed and agreed to in April. Since closing the purchase, Musk has pulled dozens of Tesla engineers to Twitter to assist him with code review and other work. Compared to the Nasdaq Composite which has declined about 33% year to date, Tesla shares are off 46%, wiping out a big chunk of Musk's fortune. However, he's still the world's richest person with a net worth of close to $200 billion, according to Forbes. At a conference last week, Musk told hedge fund manager Ron Baron that his ""workload went up from about, I don't know, 78 hours a week to probably 120."" Musk, who's also CEO of SpaceX, said on stage that ""once Twitter is set on the right path, I think it is a much easier thing to manage"" than his other companies. Musk hasn't said who will be the new CEO of Twitter, but he's suggested that his role as ""Chief Twit"" and sole director at the company is only temporary.

GDA via AP Images By Christina Pazzanese Harvard Staff Writer DateNovember 22, 2022November 22, 2022 Since Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, purchased Twitter for $44 billion last month, the company has undergone a series of abrupt shifts. Some changes, like Musk’s firing of 50 percent of the firm’s 7,000 employees, were deliberate. But others, like the walkout of more than 1,000 additional key infrastructure staff, as well as advertisers, were not. Musk’s stated desire to make Twitter a haven for any speech “within the bounds of the law” has led to a sharp uptick in posts advocating white nationalism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and right-wing threats of political violence, prompting many users to reconsider whether they will continue using the platform. Critics say all these radical moves are akin to lighting Twitter investors’ money on fire. But is there a method to Musk’s madness? Andy Wu is an assistant professor of business administration at Harvard Business School who studies technology entrepreneurs and the strategies they use to gain a competitive edge. Wu spoke to the Gazette about his take on Musk’s recent moves. Interview has been edited for clarity and length. GAZETTE: Many of Elon Musk’s moves at Twitter have been widely criticized as being erratic and even foolhardy. Some in tech suggest there’s more of a “move fast, break things” strategy to it than perhaps meets the eye. How does it look to you? WU: We shouldn’t be surprised by the management style that Musk is taking to Twitter. What he’s doing here is consistent with how he operates SpaceX and Tesla and his other businesses. While it isn’t quite building electric cars or going to Mars, the situation that Musk is stepping into at Twitter is challenging and might call for a leader who is willing to take some risks here rather than remain conservative as Twitter has been for a while. Prior to the acquisition, Twitter as a company was much weaker than most people realize. They’ve struggled with profitability for many years, and they’ve been quite slow at innovating on new features and growth opportunities. By doing this deal and having the media attention on Twitter, all we’re really doing is exposing a lot of that weakness to the public that we just hadn’t noticed or thought about before. There’s definitely a lot of rough edges to what Musk has been doing so far at Twitter. But I would argue that many of these even sometimes laughable mistakes that we have seen over the last few weeks are an inevitable consequence of having to make some kinds of decisions here very, very quickly. For example, one big challenge for Twitter is that its ongoing cost structure is a bit out of hand and, by any metric, above comparable social media companies. And so, there is definitely an incentive here for them to try to get that in line sooner rather than later. If you compare Meta/Facebook to Twitter, Facebook has had twice the revenue per employee as Twitter, and Facebook has significantly more employees working on long-range, innovative initiatives than Twitter. To a large extent, Twitter was inefficient at maintaining its ongoing operations, as well as innovating on new features. So, the fact that Musk came in and then laid off half the company is consistent with trying to get that particular benchmark in line. We should definitely feel sympathy for all the people at Twitter who have gone through this. But at the same time, we shouldn’t be surprised that Musk has chosen to start off in this way. GAZETTE: Even before Musk’s purchase, Twitter was an influential but unprofitable business that lost money eight of the last 10 years. Now, digital ad revenues are falling pretty rapidly across the Internet, and advertisers are pausing or bailing on Twitter. What is the company’s financial outlook? WU: It’s definitely a precarious situation for the company. We have to keep in mind that Musk and his co-investors do have more capital available should they want to again bail out the company. So, in that sense, they do theoretically have some flexibility on what to do about the coming interest payments on the debt that has been taken on. That said, the fallen advertising revenue has probably been more dramatic than anyone expected. The advertisers are right to at least take a pause here and think about whether they want to remain involved with Twitter. In the longer term, Musk certainly wants to build revenue streams beyond advertising, but we don’t know yet if premium memberships or financial payments or any other ideas will be able to make up for the lost advertising revenue. But they will definitely try. A big motivation for this deal was that Musk and his co-investors like Peter Thiel and others really wanted to build and protect a vision of Twitter as a public forum or a town square for free speech. Their preconception of free speech is politically and ideologically divisive. And for good reason, there are many advertisers out there who don’t want to be affiliated with that definition of free speech. But if that’s the vision they want to go for, inevitably they need to figure out a way of monetizing the business other than advertising revenue, because the lost advertising revenue is a cost they will face in perpetuity. The reaction of advertisers today is more of a prelude to what might happen in the future. So far, we haven’t seen that many structural changes to the business yet, and the changes and experiments are rolling out progressively day by day. “To a large extent, Twitter was inefficient at maintaining its ongoing operations, as well as innovating on new features,” says Andy Wu. “So, the fact that Musk came in and then laid off half the company is consistent with trying to get that particular benchmark in line.”  Photo by Russ Campbell GAZETTE: What does Musk need to do in the coming days to stabilize things or at least convince everyone that things are under control? WU: It’s essential that he continue to actively engage with all stakeholders here. In the short term, calming the advertisers down is going to be very important, and Musk has already made moves in that direction. In the longer term, Musk either needs to agree to some of the demands of the advertisers, or he needs to more aggressively experiment with and grow the alternative revenue streams that he seems to aspire to. He’s proposed things like premium memberships, as well as a financial payment system akin to WeChat. We’ve yet to see if any of those are going to materialize into something significant financially. For me, the No. 1 priority today would be to make sure that the broader technical infrastructure and social graph of Twitter stays active. There are a lot of features on the surface that you can play around with — say, the blue checkmark — but most importantly, he needs to make sure the website and basic app continue to run. For instance, Twitter needs to be able to handle the scaling up of traffic for the World Cup and stay operational when the most eyes are on it. On that front, it’s a very dangerous situation because Twitter has lost a lot of people, both through the layoffs as well as a significant amount of people willingly deciding to leave. Musk is at risk of losing or having already lost critical people in the background who make this whole thing work. GAZETTE: Twitter has been under a consent decree for over a decade over data privacy and security violations. Back in May, the company had to pay the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission a $150 million civil penalty for misleading consumers on how they planned to use their personal information. On Friday Twitter executives who served on a governance board the FTC had ordered into existence left the company, prompting Senate Democrats to urge the FTC to investigate whether that violated the settlement terms. Also, last week, the FTC tweeted out what looked to many like a call for whistleblowers asking ex-employees to get in touch. Is Twitter facing any real threat from federal regulators? WU: Absolutely. Twitter needs to be very careful about managing the legal and regulatory situation. The kinds of big moves that Musk has publicly considered are certainly going to ruffle feathers. There are people in D.C. who would be upset with that and want to bring attention to Twitter. Furthermore, the broader risk of regulatory and legal problems is not just about the United States. There are a lot of other global regimes that may have problems with what Musk is doing here. There are any number of problems that could arise. Data privacy is an important issue. The other important issue is the question of content moderation. Different countries and governments have different perceptions of what is an appropriate level of content moderation. Other countries expect more stringent content moderation than we would in the United States. Even in places like Canada, where they would prefer stricter controls than we necessarily do in the U.S., Twitter appears to be moving in a direction that is going to challenge some of those norms and will possibly put the company at risk, at a minimum, of increased government attention.

My sepia-tinted memories of what Twitter was—or could possibly have become—dissolved at the prospect of stuffing money in the pocket of the ...","To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories Find anything you save across the site in your account  By Jelani Cobb It has been an interminable month since Elon Musk assumed control of Twitter and showed up in its headquarters while carrying a bathroom sink. (In a leaden pun that foreshadowed what was to come, Musk tweeted, “let that sink in.”) The platform has since shed two-thirds of its workforce; lost half of its top hundred advertisers, including Citigroup, Merck pharmaceuticals, and Chevrolet; witnessed the rushed introduction and abrupt cancellation of a laughable subscription-payment scheme; reinstated the account of a former President who used the platform to promote a violent attack on the United States Capitol; and lost at least a million users. Last week, after fourteen years on the platform, I became one of them. Former Twitter users, like digital expats, have turned up on new shores—platforms such as Mastodon and Post News—with hopes of re-creating some semblance of their former online community minus the toxicity that sent them into exile. On November 20th, the Mastodon handle @LauraMartinez posted, “I’m here because Elon broke Twitter,” which was more of a summary of what a great many people felt about the old platform than a zealous endorsement of the buggy, complicated new one. This is a loss because, for all of Twitter’s flaws, people stuck with it for a reason. A decade ago, when Tony Wang, Twitter’s general manager in the U.K., notably described the platform as the “free speech wing of the free speech party,” he was defending users who had violated British law by sharing the details of public figures who had obtained privacy injunctions from U.K. courts. It was easy in those early days, when the heady afterglow of the Arab Spring still cast social media in a favorable light, to think of Twitter as simply the new frontier of digital democracy. Even after the platform’s unsavory practices, such as its monetization of users’ attention spans and its algorithmic manipulations, became more broadly known, Twitter still offered enough trade-offs to potentially redeem itself. Scroll back to May 26, 2020, the day after the excruciating video of George Floyd’s murder went viral on the platform. First, a large crowd gathered on the streets of Minneapolis, then in Oakland, and then in Pensacola, and even in Frisco, Texas, and outside the Iowa Statehouse. Online outrage begat outrage in the streets. The flow of communication was lateral, not vertical. People informed their peers about the nature of our government’s failings. Were it not for social media, George Floyd—along with Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor—would likely have joined the long gallery of invisible dead Black people, citizens whose bureaucratized deaths were hidden and ignored. This is what was at stake, quietly and loudly, when Musk acquired Twitter. The singular virtue of the fiasco over which Musk has presided is the possibility that the outcome will sever, at least temporarily, the American conflation of wealth with intellect. Market valuation is not proof of genius. Ahead of the forty-four-billion-dollar deal that gave Musk private control of Twitter, he proclaimed that he would “unlock” the site’s potential if given the chance. His admirers hailed his interest with glee. Musk has been marketed as a kind of can-do avatar, a magical mix of Marvel comics and Ayn Rand, despite serial evidence to the contrary, like the allegations of abusive treatment of Tesla workers. Mike Tyson famously observed that “everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.” The facile idea was that, as Kara Swisher pointed out on her podcast, Musk was potentially the one person who could solve Twitter’s long-term profitability problem. Such praise paved the way for the current state of affairs, where many, including Musk himself, believe Twitter’s collapse might be imminent. (Swisher, to her credit, later pointed out where Musk went astray, taking particular note of his tweet, which she deemed homophobic, regarding the assault on Paul Pelosi.) Musk’s vision for Twitter, never entirely coherent, cracked at first contact with economic reality. His disdain for advertising meant that the companies purchasing ads would view him warily. Moreover, his lifting of bans on Twitter’s most truculent users inspired understandable fear from advertisers that their products would appear next to homophobic, racist, sexist or generally misanthropic tweets. Musk’s desire to replace lost ad revenue with subscriptions—while simultaneously reducing content moderation—made even less sense. He, effectively, asked people to pay for membership in a community where they were now more likely to be abused. Participating in Twitter—with its world-spanning reach, its potential to radically democratize our discourse along with its virtue mobs and trolls—always required a cost-benefit analysis. That analysis began to change, at least for me, immediately after Musk took over. His reinstatement of Donald Trump’s account made remaining completely untenable. Following an absurd Twitter poll about whether Trump should be allowed to return, Musk reinstated the former President. The implication was clear: if promoting the January 6, 2021, insurrection—which left at least seven people dead and more than a hundred police officers injured—doesn’t warrant suspension to Musk, then nothing else on the platform likely could. Musk’s ownership is markedly different from the one that preceded it. He took the company private, and Twitter is no longer a publicly traded entity. In a sense, the users whose tweets drive what remains of its shrinking ad revenue are his most important employees. My sepia-tinted memories of what Twitter was—or could possibly have become—dissolved at the prospect of stuffing money in the pocket of the richest man on the planet. Yet leaving has yielded its own complications, including unwinding connections to sources, colleagues, and roughly four hundred thousand followers. The alternatives that have gained prominence in recent weeks do not offer the same reach, or the rich vein of dissimilarity across social and geographic lines, that were some of the best aspects of Twitter. As the Times observed of disgruntled conservatives, vowing to leave Twitter is easier than actually doing so. My decision to leave yielded a tide of farewells but also two other types of responses. The first was low-grade trolling that had the effect of validating my decision to depart. But the second was more nuanced and complicated, an argument that leaving offered a concession to the abusive, reactionary elements whose presence has become increasingly prominent since Musk took over. One person paraphrased the writer Sarah Kendzior, urging users to “never cede ground in an information war.” Those arguments are increasingly frail, though. If there is, in fact, an information war raging on Twitter, Musk is a profiteer. Twitter is what it always was: a money-making venture—just more nakedly so. And it now subsidizes a billionaire who understands free speech to be synonymous with the right to abuse others. (While claiming to champion free speech, Musk has selectively granted it, suspending accounts that are critical of him and firing employees who dissented from his view of how the company should be run.) The tech industry’s gimmick to monetize our attention has been astoundingly successful even if Twitter has habitually struggled to be profitable. In the end, Musk’s leadership of the company appears to be a cynical form of trolling—creating a welcoming environment for some of the platform’s worst actors while simultaneously hailing his new order for its inclusivity. To the extent that people remain active on Twitter, they preserve the fragile viability of Musk’s gambit. The illusory sense of community that still lingers on the platform is one of Musk’s most significant assets. No matter which side prevails, the true victor in any war is the person selling weapons to both sides. It seems likely that this experiment will conclude with bankruptcy and Twitter falling into the hands of creditors who will have their own ideas of what it should be and whom it should serve.

(In a leaden pun that foreshadowed what was to come, Musk tweeted, “let that sink in.”) The platform has since shed two-thirds of its workforce; lost half of its top hundred advertisers, including Citigroup, Merck pharmaceuticals, and Chevrolet; witnessed the rushed introduction and abrupt cancellation of a laughable subscription-payment scheme; reinstated the account of a former President who used the platform to promote a violent attack on the United States Capitol; and lost at least a million users. Last week, after fourteen years on the platform, I became one of them. Former Twitter users, like digital expats, have turned up on new shores—platforms such as Mastodon and Post News—with hopes of re-creating some semblance of their former online community minus the toxicity that sent them into exile. On November 20th, the Mastodon handle @LauraMartinez posted, “I’m here because Elon broke Twitter,” which was more of a summary of what a great many people felt about the old platform than a zealous endorsement of the buggy, complicated new one. This is a loss because, for all of Twitter’s flaws, people stuck with it for a reason. A decade ago, when Tony Wang, Twitter’s general manager in the U.K., notably described the platform as the “free speech wing of the free speech party,” he was defending users who had violated British law by sharing the details of public figures who had obtained privacy injunctions from U.K. courts. It was easy in those early days, when the heady afterglow of the Arab Spring still cast social media in a favorable light, to think of Twitter as simply the new frontier of digital democracy. Even after the platform’s unsavory practices, such as its monetization of users’ attention spans and its algorithmic manipulations, became more broadly known, Twitter still offered enough trade-offs to potentially redeem itself. Scroll back to May 26, 2020, the day after the excruciating video of George Floyd’s murder went viral on the platform. First, a large crowd gathered on the streets of Minneapolis, then in Oakland, and then in Pensacola, and even in Frisco, Texas, and outside the Iowa Statehouse. Online outrage begat outrage in the streets. The flow of communication was lateral, not vertical. People informed their peers about the nature of our government’s failings. Were it not for social media, George Floyd—along with Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor—would likely have joined the long gallery of invisible dead Black people, citizens whose bureaucratized deaths were hidden and ignored. This is what was at stake, quietly and loudly, when Musk acquired Twitter. The singular virtue of the fiasco over which Musk has presided is the possibility that the outcome will sever, at least temporarily, the American conflation of wealth with intellect.

After a brutal wave of layoffs and resignations, Elon Musk told Twitter employees that the company wants to hire more engineers.","By  Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He’s covered the tech industry for over a decade at The Information and other outlets. After purging nearly two-thirds of Twitter’s 7,500-person workforce in three weeks, Elon Musk is hiring again. During an all-hands meeting with Twitter employees today, Musk said that the company is done with layoffs and actively recruiting for roles in engineering and sales and that employees are encouraged to make referrals, according to two people who attended and a partial recording obtained by The Verge. His comments were made the same day that an unspecified wave of cuts hit Twitter’s sales department, which has lost almost all of its senior leadership since Musk took over. Musk didn’t specify the kinds of engineering or sales roles Twitter was hiring for, and the company doesn’t currently have any open roles listed on its website. “In terms of critical hires, I would say people who are great at writing software are the highest priority,” he said during the meeting. The Verge reported last week that Twitter recruiters were already reaching out to engineers asking them to join “Twitter 2.0 — an Elon company.” Monday’s all-hands meeting was the first time that Twitter’s employees heard from Musk since he required them all to opt into staying for his “extremely hardcore” cultural reset, which led to roughly 1,000 resignations last week. While fielding employee questions for about a half-hour from Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters, Musk said there are “no plans” to move Twitter’s headquarters to Texas like he did with Tesla, but that it could make sense to be “dual-headquartered” in California and Texas. “This is not a right-wing takeover of Twitter. It is a moderate-wing takeover of Twitter.” “If we want to move the headquarters to Texas I think it would play into the idea that Twitter has gone from being left-wing to right-wing, which is not the case,” he told employees. “This is not a right-wing takeover of Twitter. It is a moderate-wing takeover of Twitter.”  Musk went on to say that, “to be the digital town square, we must represent people with a wide array of views even if we disagree with those views.” (He didn’t address his firings of dozens of employees for posting tweets and Slack messages criticizing him over the last couple of weeks.) He acknowledged that his ongoing reorganization of the company will “have a lot of mistakes” but “stabilize over time.” In response to one employee question, he said that “significant portions of the technology stack need to be rebuilt from scratch,” and at another point in the meeting he suggested it would be a good idea to “somewhat decentralize[] things” by setting up engineering teams in Japan, India, Indonesia, and Brazil. Twitter’s historically strong usage in Japan was specifically called out by Musk as what the company should aspire to “ideally in every country without exception.”  “It may seem as though Twitter is US-centric but if anything it’s Japan-centric” “It may seem as though Twitter is US-centric but if anything it’s Japan-centric,” he said. “There are roughly the same number of daily active users in Japan as there are in the US, despite the fact that Japan has one third of the population of the US.” In response to a question about employee compensation, Musk reiterated that employees will be given stock options in Twitter and be able to cash them out regularly like at SpaceX, his other company that is also privately held. “The way things work at SpaceX to get liquidity is that every six months there’s a liquidity event where the company buys back shares and we also invite new investors to buy shares,” he said. “And we’ll be able to operate Twitter in the same way.” Do you know more about what’s going on inside Twitter? I’d love to chat. You can reach me by email at alex.heath@theverge.com or through the contact form on my Linktree. Then we can set up a secure thread on Signal. Anyone entering Twitter now will work in a much smaller company than it was before Musk took over. While the exact number of departures under his watch is unclear, there were nearly 7,400 people with access to Twitter’s internal systems before he laid off about half the company. That number, which excludes the thousands of outside contractors Musk also cut, has since fallen to just over 2,700 people as of press time, according to two people who have seen the numbers.  The departures have included long-tenured engineers, some with more than a decade of experience at the company, as well as a growing list of corporate leaders. Twitter’s CEO, CFO, and chief legal officer were all removed on Musk’s first day. Twitter’s top advertising and content partnership leaders have either resigned or been fired. And multiple “critical” teams were completely gutted by the layoffs and resignations, according to current and former employees.

         Twitter CEO Elon Musk now says he wants to charge users $8 per month to retain their verification badge or obtain one on the platform — after an earlier report suggested he might seek even more for the privilege. On Tuesday, Musk outlined his plan on Twitter and called the current system that gives out the blue checkmark badges ""bulls**t."" The blue check feature, indicating that the person's identity has been verified, would become part of Twitter Blue, which costs $5 a month.  ""Power to the people! Blue for $8/month,"" he wrote. The blue checkmark has become a coveted marker of status among some of the celebrities, politicians and journalists who are heavy users of Twitter. On Sunday, Musk said the whole verification process is getting ""revamped.""  For the $8 monthly charge, users will also get priority in replies, mentions and search, ability to post longer videos and audio, and half as many ads, Musk said. He said that there would be a ""paywall bypass"" for publishers who are ""willing to work with us."" The new strategy, he said, will give Twitter a revenue stream to reward content creators.  He added that there will be a secondary tag below a public figure's name, much like there is now for politicians. Opponents of the approach say it will make it easier for users to spread disinformation or to impersonate someone else on Twitter. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez mocked the idea of Musk charging user fees. ""Lmao at a billionaire earnestly trying to sell people on the idea that 'free speech' is actually a $8/mo subscription plan,"" she tweeted.  Still, Musk is undeterred.  ""To all complainers, please continue complaining, but it will cost $8,"" he wrote.  The SpaceX and Tesla CEO went on to share a clip of the British comedy show Monty Python, which he says inspired him. ""Totally stole idea of charging for insults & arguments from Monty Python tbh,"" he wrote. Totally stole idea of charging for insults & arguments from Monty Python tbh https://t.co/oFKRyp3BS7 The plan comes after The Verge reported Musk was looking to charge $20 a month for blue check users — prompting fierce pushback, including from legendary horror writer Stephen King, who said ""Twitter should pay"" him to stay on the app.   ""If that gets instituted, I'm gone like Enron,"" King tweeted, referring to the energy company that filed for bankruptcy in 2001.  Users and tech industry analysts have voiced an array of concerns about what Twitter may look like under Musk, who declared his intent to manage the platform as a ""free speech"" space. Since Musk took charge of Twitter last week, the platform has seen a significant spike in hate speech, according to a new study. Researchers from Montclair State University found that the 12 hours immediately following Musk's ascension to ownership saw a much more ""hostile"" environment on Twitter.

If the billionaire succeeds at Twitter, the MBA will need an update. Nov 7th 2022. Share. Elon musk's takeover ...","Elon musk’s takeover of Twitter raises questions of policy: is it right for the world’s richest man to own such an important forum for public debate? It raises issues of law: is his decision to get rid of so many workers within days of completing the acquisition above board? And it raises questions of strategy: can Twitter make money by moving from a business model based on advertising to one based on subscription? But it is also an extremely public test of a particular style of management. In the way he thinks about work, decision-making and the role of the CEO, Mr Musk is swimming against the tide.  Your browser does not support the <audio> element. His attitude to employees is an obvious example of his counter-cultural approach. For a futurist, Mr Musk is a very old-fashioned boss. He doesn’t like remote work. Earlier this year he sent an email to employees at Tesla demanding that they come to the office for at least 40 hours a week. Anyone who thought this was antiquated could “pretend to work somewhere else”, he tweeted.  Whatever the legality of his decision to fire so many Twitter workers, his methods are brutal: people locked out of corporate IT accounts, careers ended with an impersonal email, half the workforce gone at a stroke. It is as if Thanos had decided to try his hand at business. For those who remain, hard graft is the expectation; insiders say that one of Mr Musk’s first acts at the firm was to cancel monthly firm-wide “days of rest”. The template for the modern manager tends to be a low-ego, compassionate boss who gives people autonomy. Someone didn’t get the memo.  His critics have to accept that the my-way-or-the-highway approach has worked before. At his other firms, like Tesla and SpaceX, Mr Musk may not have offered empathy but he has provided a planet-sized sense of purpose, from popularising electric vehicles to colonising Mars. Whether this can work for him at Twitter is less clear. His vision for the product as a “digital town square” where free speech flourishes is a typically grand one. This time, however, he is not taking on lumbering incumbents, but fixing an existing business where judgment and politics matter as much as engineering.  The way that Mr Musk takes decisions also cuts across consensus. Comparatively little research has been done on how CEOs make their choices, but a Harvard Business School working paper published in 2020 had a bash by asking 262 of the school’s own alumni how they went about making strategy.  The authors of the paper did discover a wide range of approaches, with some managers going on gut instinct and others using very formalised processes. But the researchers found that bosses who use more structured processes tend to lead bigger and faster-growing firms (which way causality runs is not clear). They also tend to make decisions more slowly. Mr Musk and his acolytes are in a different camp: fast, informal and aggressive. Reports are already surfacing of fired Twitter workers being asked to come back. He is unorthodox in another way, too. Peter Drucker, a doyen among management thinkers, described the CEO as being the person in the organisation who bridges the outside world and the inner workings of the company. No one else in the firm is in a position to combine these perspectives, Mr Drucker wrote.  Mr Musk is not so much bridging this gap as making the distinction between the inside and outside of the company irrelevant. His personal brand and wealth is inextricably linked with the other firms he runs. At Twitter he is going even further, tossing out product ideas on his own Twitter feed, polling the audience for their views and offering real-time commentary on how things are going. And Twitter itself is a platform on which everyone—users, ex-employees, the people who founded the firm, policymakers and pundits—weighs in publicly to say how things are going. There is not much of an inside to talk of.  You might object that Mr Musk is a one-off, and so is this deal. When he first made his offer to buy Twitter, he explicitly said that it was not because of an economic rationale. He later tried to wriggle out of the transaction entirely. The story of a billionaire owner of a social-media platform has little in common with the challenges that preoccupy the salaried executives of most public firms. Maybe so, but if Mr Musk makes another success of his latest venture by being brutal to his workforce, skipping the PowerPoint sessions and managing through memes, the MBA will still need a bit of an update.

Will Twitter Survive Elon Musk? · News that Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion on Oct. · In little more than a month, Musk slashed his ...","By Lisa Intrabartola Date December 1, 2022 Media Contact Lisa Intrabartola lisa.intrabartola@rutgers.edu News that Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion on Oct. 27 barely had a chance to ""sink in"" before the billionaire got busy gutting the social media platform. In little more than a month, Musk slashed his staff, reinstated 62,000 banned accounts, introduced a plan to switch from ad-sponsored to a paid user subscription and changed the way misinformation is policed.  Just this week he went to war with Apple – and then quickly settled it – over speculation that the iPhone maker was considering removing Twitter from its app store. Will Twitter survive Musk’s tumultuous takeover? Will concerns about brand safety scare off advertisers? Should users pay to post their opinions? Will attempts to bolster free speech only elevate hate speech?  Rutgers Today asked Stacy Smollin Schwartz, a marketing professor at Rutgers Business School and the founding director of its fully online Master of Science in Digital Marketing program, to shed some light on the story, which is changing by the hour. Twitter shed over half of its employees since Elon Musk took the helm. But Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos also announced recent layoffs at Meta/Facebook and Amazon, with Google following suit. What is going on, and what does this mean for the user experience?  Big Tech has seen enormous growth in the past few years, even throughout the pandemic, and it is inevitable that there would be a contraction in an economic recession.  Most of this downsizing has been relatively mild corrections in the big picture. For instance, after growing by more than 23 percent in 2021 to more than 1.6 million employees, Amazon is expected to lay off approximately 10,000 positions this year – or less than 1 percent of its total workforce. Same with Google, which is expected to cut 7 percent of its workforce after growing it 16 percent last year.  Meta got hit a little harder than its peers, because of its ill-timed and ambitious bet on an ad-supported metaverse in 2022. Meta’s data-driven ad-supported revenue model was further strained by Apple’s enforcement of its 2021 App Tracking Transparency (ATT) Policy, which limits the ad targeting capabilities of Facebook and Instagram. As a result, Meta recently eliminated 11,000 jobs, or 13 percent of its workforce. None of these headlines has me concerned about the long-term viability of social media platforms or the role of advertising as a significant source of their funding.  However, with Twitter, it does. Recently – and rather indiscriminately – Twitter cut its workforce in half, back down to staffing levels last seen in 2017. This was not downsizing, this was slashing.  In the last month, Twitter announced new terms of service regulations, unlocked controversial suspended accounts and rolled out a verification procedure that was swiftly rolled back. What Twitter advertising trends do you expect to see in the future given this new policy? Do you anticipate companies will leave or reduce spending or vice versa? Will moving away from an advertising model cause too much loss in revenue? Twitter derives revenue from advertisers, many of whom purchase the bulk of their digital ad inventory in May for the following year during an industry event called the “newfronts.”  Last year, Twitter had a strong presence at the event, showcasing its content and advertising capabilities just one month after Musk made his initial offer to purchase Twitter. Many advertisers shied away, concerned about the uncertainty Musk’s offer brought to the platform.  Since that time and throughout the acquisition, Musk has done little to reassure advertisers that Twitter would remain a stable, brand-safe environment for their advertising messages. Amidst all the public controversy, many marketers who did invest opted to indefinitely pause their campaigns, which generated insults and more drama from Musk, pushing them even further away. Some experts say that Elon Musk is intentionally trying to bankrupt Twitter. What do you think?   I do not think he is trying to purposely bankrupt Twitter. Rather, he is trying to demonstrate to the world that he needs to break things to fix them his way. Although Musk claims that drastic steps are necessary so that Twitter doesn’t go bankrupt (especially given the level of debt he incurred), it is difficult for me to comprehend how mistreating your employees, confusing your users and repelling your only revenue stream is doing right by your investors.  But those who believe in Musk are used to his special brand of chaos, drama and celebrity. They likely embrace this as evidence of “genius,” part of his innovation process.   What does this mean for Twitter long term?  What are your thoughts on how Twitter can be improved?  I do think there are some inherent problems with social media in general that need addressing, namely getting verification under control and amplifying real humans as opposed to bots and trolls, agreeing on an acceptable way to deal with and prevent hate speech and enhancing the user experience while relying on an ad-supported model that can fatigue users.  If you believe in the social benefits of Twitter in the long-term, perhaps its future does lie in introducing a subscription model. For example, what if you could read Twitter for free, but there is a paywall if you want the ability to post? Or perhaps each Tweet posted beyond a minimum allocation will require a micropayment? These steps might re-humanize the platform, weeding out the bots and trolls as well as the real humans who don’t think sharing their opinion is worth paying for. Adding a subscription model would surely shrink Twitter as we know it (both in users and content) and allow new competitors to emerge.  Social media has become a primary source of information from national, state and local government agencies during natural disasters, including hurricanes and earthquakes, and safety crises such as mass shootings. What responsibility does Twitter have to ensure that emergency communications are accurate and timely to save lives? Should social media channels be regulated like public utilities given that they play such a crucial role in distributing public information?  As a for-profit enterprise without a social mission, Musk has no responsibility to maintain the platform for public crises or emergency use. Should he wish to do so, in the subscription model outlined above, it is conceivable that verified government and nonprofit (but apolitical) entities could receive free subscriptions that allow them to post as needed for the benefit of the public. There is a real possibility that Twitter withers away under its debt obligations under Musk’s watch. If this happens, government and public entities will find a replacement for their broadcast messages, and journalists will need to find a replacement for researching stories and finding relevant sources – perhaps an existing platform like Reddit or TikTok will rise to the occasion, or a new micro-blog platform will emerge as substitute.

https://www.protocol.com/elon-musk-flight-tracker,Elon Musk offers $50k to teen to remove flight tracker bot - Protocol,20221101,"A 19-year-old built a flight-tracking Twitter bot. Elon Musk tried to pay him to stop. · 'I've put a lot of work into it, and $5k is just really not enough.","‘I’ve put a lot of work into it, and $5k is just really not enough.’ Elon Musk considers the Twitter account a security risk.  “Can you take this down? It is a security risk.”  That’s how Elon Musk opened a conversation with 19-year-old Jack Sweeney over Twitter DM last fall. He was referencing a Twitter account, called @ElonJet, which tracks the movements of his private jet around the world.  It was a late-night message, coming in at 12:13 a.m. Sweeney’s time, but the college freshman didn’t lose any sleep. His reply, nearly seven hours later: “Yes I can but it’ll cost you a Model 3 only joking unless?”  @ElonJet is one of 15 flight-tracking accounts Sweeney has created, run by bots he’s programmed to parse the data and tweet every time a chosen plane takes off or lands. Each one follows a high-profile person, almost all in tech, including Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. But Musk’s tracker is the most popular, with nearly 83,000 followers.  The account's popularity appears to have scared Musk. “I don’t love the idea of being shot by a nutcase,” he told Sweeney in their DM conversation.   The conversation continued for a few more messages. Musk asked Sweeney how much he made off the Twitter accounts, which Sweeney said was no more than $20 a month. Then Elon Musk made his own offer: $5,000 to delete the account and help the billionaire keep “crazy people” from tracking his location. Sweeney told Musk to add another 0. “Any chance to up that to $50k? It would be great support in college and would possibly allow me to get a car maybe even a Model 3.”  Musk said he’d think about it. But so far, he hasn’t paid Sweeney a dime, and the account is still running. Sweeney says he’s okay with getting ghosted. He’s benefited a lot from @ElonJet and the other accounts, he said: He's gained social media followers, learned how to code and even scored a part time job at UberJets as an application developer. Better yet, the self-described Elon Musk “fan” got to have a conversation with a man he’s looked up to for years.  Though the Twitter accounts haven’t led to any dangerous incidents so far, at least according to Sweeney’s knowledge and information available online, Musk does have a point. Celebrities getting ambushed at airports — by fans, by people who want to sell their autograph, paparazzi, stalkers and the like — is certainly a thing. And Musk and other tech CEOs have become bona fide celebrities in recent years. (Protocol contacted SpaceX’s media team to ask whether there had been any violent incidents or threats — one of the only remaining ways for the press to contact Musk after he dissolved Tesla’s PR team last year — but got no response.)  But Twitter bots don’t get starstruck. They’ve just gone on parsing the data Sweeney’s told them to. The 15 bots use FAA information when available — the administration keeps track of when and where planes depart and land, as well as their intended path. However, Musk’s plane and many others are on the LADD block list, which removes identifying information from the data.   Even blocked planes aren't truly private, though. In these cases, Sweeney uses data from the ADS-B transponders present on most aircraft which show a plane’s location in the air in real time as charted on the ADS-B Exchange. Parsing this information is like a logic puzzle: Sweeney’s bots can use a plane’s altitude, combined with how long ago the data was received, to determine when it is taking off or landing. They can then cross-reference latitude and longitude with a database of airports to determine where the plane is leaving or headed. And though Sweeney’s bots can’t pull from blocked FAA data to figure out where a plane plans to go, they can cross-reference the real-time ADS-B data with another website that posts anonymized versions of the FAA flight plans. This allows the bot to match the plane it is tracking in real time to the anonymized FAA flight plans and determine each plane’s intended destination. This information is all entirely public, and can be used to track most private aircraft.  It’s a loophole in high-profile security that has only flown under the radar because one needs a lot of industry-specific knowledge to know all this data was available and public, and to understand how to parse it. Sweeney had that context: His father works in the airline industry, and Sweeney has been tracking planes since he was a child. Like many young boys, he says he would try to identify types of planes as they flew across the sky, often checking his guesses against what he could find in online flight tracker apps. Once Sweeney explained to Musk where he was finding the data, the entrepreneur was surprised by how accessible it all was. “Air traffic control is so primitive,” he said.  The most recent DM Musk and Sweeney exchanged was last Wednesday, when Sweeney said he’d prefer an internship over payment in return for deleting the account. Musk hasn’t opened the message, Sweeney says, but he’s not offended. In fact, he thinks he knows why Musk went silent: “I think he’s on vacay in Hawaii if you check ElonJet.”

On any given day, Lily AI runs hundreds of machine learning models using computer vision and natural language processing that are customized for its retail and ecommerce clients to make website product recommendations, forecast demand, and plan merchandising. But this spring when the company was in the market for a machine learning operations platform to manage its expanding model roster, it wasn’t easy to find a suitable off-the-shelf system that could handle such a large number of models in deployment while also meeting other criteria. Some MLops platforms are not well-suited for maintaining even more than 10 machine learning models when it comes to keeping track of data, navigating their user interfaces, or reporting capabilities, Matthew Nokleby, machine learning manager for Lily AI’s product intelligence team, told Protocol earlier this year. “The duct tape starts to show,” he said.

As Elon Musk's ownership of Twitter entered its third week, and ...","Departures of top figures handling safety, security, privacy and compliance come amid warnings from Federal Trade Commission As Elon Musk’s ownership of Twitter entered its third week, and following mass layoffs, the billionaire laid bare a delicate financial future for the social media platform, amid an exodus of top privacy and security executives. Yoel Roth, the head of safety and integrity who had been deputized to publicly address concerns advertisers and users had about the platform, is reportedly the latest to leave the company. The departures began on the same day Elon Musk addressed employees for the first time, saying that “bankruptcy isn’t out of the question”, according to multiple reports. The day began with the resignation of three top security officials – chief information security officer Lea Kissner, chief privacy officer Damien Kieran and chief compliance officer Marianne Fogarty – prompting warnings from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). (Twitter reached a settlement over privacy issues with the FTC in May.) Following those departures, Roth and Twitter’s head of client solutions, Robin Wheeler, also left the company. I've made the hard decision to leave Twitter. I've had the opportunity to work with amazing people and I'm so proud of the privacy, security, and IT teams and the work we've done.I'm looking forward to figuring out what's next, starting with my reviews for @USENIXSecurity 😁 Time honored tradition. ✌️#oneteam pic.twitter.com/ZS1FtMFivK In an email to employees and a subsequent staff meeting, Musk did little to inspire confidence in the company’s future. In one email, Musk described the dire economic circumstances the company was in and how important he believed its subscription service, Twitter Blue, was to its future. “Without significant subscription revenue, there is a good chance Twitter will not survive the upcoming economic downturn,” Musk said in the email. “We need roughly half of our revenue to be subscription.” One employee also said at the staff meeting that Musk appeared to downplay employee concerns about how a pared-back Twitter workforce was handling its obligations to maintain privacy and data security standards. Musk’s memo and staff meeting echoed a livestreamed conversation on Wednesday in which he tried to assuage the concerns of major advertisers and made his most expansive public comments about Twitter’s direction since he closed the $44bn deal to buy the platform late last month and dismissed its top executives. The departures compound the issues plaguing the social media platform since Musk bought it. Musk’s takeover and the resultant confusing back-and-forth on product launches and content moderation policies have led many brands including General Mills to pause ad buys on Twitter – a development the billionaire attempted to rectify in the live stream for advertisers. The duo leading the live stream, Roth and Wheeler, have now both left the company. “So the two people Elon brought forward to talk with advertisers in an attempt to convince them to keep partnering with the company just quit,” tweeted Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change. “Companies that stay with Twitter at this point will be tied to these dangerous and unhinged policy changes.” The company’s subscription product Twitter Blue, which launched on Wednesday and allows users to buy a verified blue checkmark for $8, has already resulted in various accounts being verified despite impersonating brands or notable figures. Some civil rights groups worry that a lack of clarity on content moderation policies and the unrestrained ability to buy a blue checkmark could lead – if they haven’t already – to a scourge of hate speech and spread of misinformation. They have called on more brands to pause their advertisements on the platform. “I have never seen a billionaire begging for your $8 this much,” said Derrick Johnson, the president of the NAACP. “Clearly, our efforts – calling on companies to pause all advertising on Twitter – are working. Corporations need to be held accountable, and Twitter is no exception. Hate speech and disinformation have no place anywhere.” Under the company’s settlement with the FTC, Twitter is required to perform privacy reviews before it makes any changes to its products. But in a letter posted to Slack by an attorney on the company’s privacy team and reported by the Verge, the author says that they heard the company’s head of legal, Alex Spiro, “say that Elon is willing to take on a huge amount of risk in relation to this company and its users, because ‘Elon puts rockets into space, he’s not afraid of the FTC.’” The company’s legal team is now asking engineers to “self-certify” that their features comply with FTC rules and privacy standards, according to the Verge. In the letter, the lawyer said people should make use of the available whistleblower protections “if you feel uncomfortable about anything you’re being asked to do”. Messages seeking comment were left with Twitter, but it is unlikely someone will respond as the communications department has been laid off. The Associated Press contributed to this report"

Jennifer Justine Musk (née Wilson; born September 2, 1972)[2][3][4] is a Canadian author. 
Justine Wilson was born in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada, and she spent most of her early life there. She attended Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario and obtained a degree in English literature.  
After college, Wilson moved to Japan, teaching English as a second language (ESL). She subsequently settled in California.[1] 
Wilson is the author of the contemporary fantasy novel BloodAngel,[5] published in 2005 by the Roc Books imprint of Penguin Books. Her second book, Uninvited, was released in 2007 and is an unrelated work intended for young-adult readers. A sequel to BloodAngel, Lord of Bones, was released in 2008.[6] Musk was one of the first people to use a site like Pinterest to plan out a novel.[7] 
In a 2007 interview, she identified Margaret Atwood, Joyce Carol Oates, Paul Theroux, George R.R. Martin, Guy Gavriel Kay, and Neil Gaiman as authors to whom she could relate her writings.[8] She also described her books as cross-genre fiction. 
In January 2000, Wilson married Elon Musk. Their first child was born in 2002 and died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at the age of 10 weeks.[1][9] Through in vitro fertilization, she gave birth to twins in 2004 and to triplets in 2006.[10] On September 13, 2008, she announced that she and Musk were getting a divorce.[11] She and Musk share custody of their children.[1] 
Wilson later wrote an article for Marie Claire detailing ways she thought the marriage was unhealthy, such as Musk's dismissal of her career ambitions, his description of himself as the ""alpha"" in the relationship, and his pressure for her to become a trophy wife.[1][12] In 2010, she described herself as a ""model former wife"", and said she was on good terms with Musk's then-wife, Talulah Riley.[13] 
She has stated that she kept the last name Musk for the sake of their children.[14] In 2022, one of their twins officially changed her name to reflect her gender identity, and took Wilson as her surname because she no longer wished to be associated with her father.[15][16]

Elon Musk appears to have outsourced decisions about who to ban from Twitter to the platform's right-wing extremists, like Andy Ngo.","© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED 
            Elon Musk appears to have outsourced decisions about who to ban from Twitter to the platform's right-wing extremists.           Elon Musk claims to be “fighting for free speech in America” but the social network’s new owner appears to be overseeing a purge of left-wing activists from the platform. Several prominent antifascist organizers and journalists have had their accounts suspended in the past week, after right-wing operatives appealed directly to Musk to ban them and far-right internet trolls flooded Twitter’s complaints system with false reports about terms of service violations. As the Los Angeles City Councilmember Mike Bonin noted on Twitter, the suspended users include Chad Loder, an antifascist researcher whose open-source investigation of the U.S. Capitol riot led to the identification and arrest of a masked Proud Boy who attacked police officers. The account of video journalist Vishal Pratap Singh, who reports on far-right protests in Southern California, has also been suspended.  Twitter is silencing people who document extremism, alt-right violence & police abuse in LA.@chadloder and @vps_reports were suspended after alt-right requests — while Twitter is reinstating people who promote racism & incite anti-trans violence.  This is ugly and dangerous. pic.twitter.com/7cnhItUY8T — Mike Bonin (@mikebonin) November 26, 2022  Among the other prominent accounts suspended were the Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club, an antifascist group that provides armed security for LGBTQ+ events in North Texas, and CrimethInc, an anarchist collective that has published and distributed anarchist and anti-authoritarian zines, books, posters, and podcasts since the mid-1990s. All four accounts had been singled out for criticism by Andy Ngo, a far-right writer whose conspiratorial, error-riddled reporting on left-wing protests and social movements has fueled the mass delusion that antifa is not just a handful of small antifascist groups that counter right-wing threats, which it is, but a shadow army of domestic terrorists, which it is not. Musk is apparently among those who have mistaken Ngo’s largely fictional reporting for fact. In a public exchange on Twitter on Friday, Musk invited Ngo to report “Antifa accounts” that should be suspended directly to him. “Andy Ngo’s bizarre vision of ‘antifa’ seems to be the metric used to delete the accounts of journalists and publications, most of which engaged in verifiably good journalism and done so completely above board and TOS observant ways,” Shane Burley, editor of the anthology “¡No Pasarán!: Antifascist Dispatches From a World in Crisis,” observed on Twitter. “Paranoid delusions about antifa are driving it.” As The Intercept reported last year, Ngo had previously tried and failed to have Loder suspended from Twitter, and also joined a botched attempt to have a court order the researcher to stop tweeting about one of the Proud Boys who took part in the Capitol riot. In a phone interview on Monday, Loder, a tech company founder and cybersecurity expert, told The Intercept that their @chadloder account was initially suspended last week about 90 minutes after Musk had replied to Ngo on Twitter. After briefly regaining access to the account, Loder was suspended again and accused by Twitter of having used another account to evade the ban. Loder said that they do have access to another dormant account, @masksfordocs — which was set up in early 2020 as part of an effort by a group of activists to donate N95 masks to doctors during the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic — but had not used it for ban evasion. (Ngo had drawn attention to the @masksfordocs account on Twitter, describing it as Loder’s “alt.”) “What I believe happened is that I and other accounts have been mass reported for the last few weeks by a dedicated group of far-right extremists who want to erase archived evidence of their past misdeeds and to neutralize our ability to expose them in the future,” Loder said. “What I suspect happened is that Twitter’s automatic systems flagged my account for some reason and no human being is reviewing these.” Since Loder’s account was on a list being passed around by right-wing activists as part of a coordinated campaign to mass-report fabricated violations by left-wing Twitter users, it could have been suspended as a result of that activity. Loder shared screenshots with The Intercept showing that Telegram channels with tens of thousands of followers, including QAnon adherents and Proud Boys, had coordinated a spate of complaints about Loder’s tweets and celebrated Loder’s suspension. Although Twitter’s Trust and Safety team was made aware of the organized false-reporting campaign against Loder earlier this month — and such coordinated bulk reporting and false-flagging of accounts are violations of Twitter’s pre-Musk policy against “platform manipulation” — that team was subsequently depleted by mass resignations on November 17. Still, in a post on the open-source social network Mastodon, Loder joked about the idea that Musk was simply doing Ngo’s bidding. Whatever the reason for the suspension, Loder said it’s clear that Twitter is “no longer a viable platform” for antifascist and security researchers. “If I get my account back,” Loder said, “it’s only a matter of time before I get mass reported again.” Loder, who has shifted to Mastodon, said that for social networks, “the product you’re selling is content moderation.” Now that Musk appears to be reworking content moderation to tilt the playing field in favor of far-right extremists, Loder added, Twitter “is going to turn into Gab with crypto scams.” Loder also said that some of the right’s criticism of content moderation decisions made by pre-Musk Twitter was fair. “I also agree that Twitter shouldn’t have censored the Hunter Biden laptop story,” Loder said. “We just don’t want outright Nazis posting our home addresses.” But, Loder said, the sweeping changes made by Musk, like the increased tolerance for far-right hate speech, mean that Twitter will probably keep functioning as a website and an app for some time, but be slowly hollowed out as a place to find varying views on matters of public importance, or a space for online organizing against far-right extremism. “Twitter is communities of people who choose to organize online,” Loder said, noting how the site has been used by labor organizers and racial justice protesters in recent years to drive real-world change, and by the so-called sedition hunters who have used the platform to crowd-source visual investigations to identify rioters who took part in the failed coup at the Capitol in Washington on January 6, 2021. Twitter was a place where communities could gather, despite harassment, because the worst hate speech was banned through content moderation. “Musk has made it clear that’s no longer part of the product,” Loder said. “The entire Twitter information security community has moved to Mastodon.” Some activists who helped create Black Twitter are already talking about how to rebuild their community on that site too. “Twitter was never a healthy ‘public square’ for most of us. Let’s not rewrite history while eulogizing the hellsite,” Loder wrote on Mastodon on Sunday. “Twitter was a frightening battleground where we managed barely to claw out an uneasy existence amidst the worst violent neo-Nazi extremists who constantly published our home addresses, threatened our kids’ lives, and sent hordes of racist trolls into our mentions.” On Mastodon, they added, “The same principles that allowed us to survive uneasily on Twitter will be required here. Community defense, thoughtful pressure on moderation policies, and eternal vigilance. There are no safe spaces but those we make safe through constant effort. We keep us safe.” Twitter, Loder says, will take a long time to die and disappear entirely, “like a rotting whale carcass.” “I’ll have to repair nearly every article I’ve ever written since my tweets got wiped out,” journalist and videographer Vishal Singh wrote on Mastodon on Monday, after being banned from Twitter. “Hundreds of articles written by countless journalists used my tweets. From all sides of the political spectrum. Academic papers that cited my tweets. These links and embeds are now all broken.” Days before Singh’s account was suspended, Ngo had posted screenshots of some of the journalist’s angry tweets along with this misleading, factually incorrect summary: “Vishal Singh, an #Antifa far-left violent extremist in Los Angeles who identifies as a journalist, is calling for deadly violence again.” Singh is a left-wing journalist but did not call for violence in the tweets shared by Ngo, and is not violent. Last year, after Singh was attacked twice by far-right anti-vaccine protesters and lashed out in self-defense, Ngo posted a misleadingly captioned video and falsely accused Singh of being the aggressor. On Mastodon, Singh shared screenshots of emails from Twitter, showing that while reports had been filed against their account for the same tweets that Ngo had posted as screenshots, the company concluded that none of those tweets violated official policies. On Monday, Singh was also suspended from Instagram. “The mass false report campaign by the far-right has not stopped against my social media accounts,” they wrote on Mastodon. “The goal is to suppress all of my journalism.” Last Friday, Twitter also suspended the account of CrimethInc, an anarchist collective and publisher. The group takes its name from “thoughtcrime,” a term coined by George Orwell in the dystopian novel “1984.” In the 14 years that CrimethInc has been on Twitter, the account has never violated Twitter policies and has never been suspended. This changed last week after a Twitter exchange between Musk and Ngo.  .@crimethinc, an Antifa collective, makes riot guides, texts to radicalize people into criminal militancy, & propaganda that is shared via Twitter for people to distribute. They've claimed a number of attacks & give instructions on how to form cells, what riot gear to bring, etc. pic.twitter.com/dlNouwlt5v — Andy Ngô ???? (@MrAndyNgo) November 25, 2022  Ngo asked Musk to suspend the CrimethInc account, calling it an “Antifa collective” and falsely claiming the group had “claimed a number of attacks.” Within hours of Ngo’s request to Musk, and without citing any specific violations of policies, Twitter suspended the @crimethinc account. After the CrimethInc suspension, Ngo claimed, with typically wild and incorrect hyperbole, that the “group operates like ISIS: makes propaganda & training material to radicalize militants toward violence.” He also complained that a dozen affiliated accounts had not yet been suspended. Three days later, almost all of the additional accounts Ngo pointed to had also been suspended by Twitter. “Musk’s goal in acquiring Twitter had nothing to do with ‘free speech’ — it was a partisan move to silence opposition, paving the way for fascist violence,” CrimethInc said in a statement sent to The Intercept. The collective also explained that, on the morning of the suspension, it received an email from Twitter saying the company had “received a complaint regarding your account,” but had “investigated the reported content and have found that it is not subject to removal under the Twitter Rules.” The group said it had received no further emails from Twitter to explain or justify the ban. “This suggests that the decision to ban our account shortly thereafter was dictated by Musk himself, without regard for the Twitter Rules or any other protocol other than his own apparent allegiance to the far right.” Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. As the investigative journalist Steven Monacelli reported last week, two days after a gunman killed five people and injured 25 others in a mass shooting at Club Q, an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs, Twitter suspended the account of the Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club, an antifascist group in Texas that provides armed security for LGBTQ+ gatherings. The John Brown Gun Club — named after the white abolitionist leader John Brown who, in 1859, led an armed anti-slavery revolt — assists marginalized communities in defending themselves against white supremacist violence. LGBTQ+ events in Texas, such as a family-friendly drag brunch Monacelli covered in August, frequently attract the attention of armed far-right protesters from the Proud Boys and neo-Nazi groups like Patriot Front and Aryan Freedom Network. Twitter’s reason for suspending the account, according to the suspension report, was two tweets that supposably violated Twitter’s rules against “hateful conduct.” One was a reply to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection tweet with the text “@CBP Mugging at gun point,” and another was a joke about pronouns with the text “Every queer a riflethem.” Without being willfully misread or taken out of context, neither of those tweets constitute hateful conduct. Since its Twitter account was suspended last week, the Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club has been tweeting from a separate account, @elmforkJBGC, which has not yet been suspended. The group has also started posting on Mastodon. “The irony isn’t lost on us that our suspension coincides with a coordinated effort to reinstate the most vile antisemitic, transphobic hate accounts,” the Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club said in a statement to The Intercept. “Whether this is an indication of the future of leadership of Elon Musk’s running of Twitter, we cannot say but we can say that the timing and reasoning is deliberate and targeted.” Updated: November 29, 2022, 6:05 pm ET

Among the issues Musk has expressed interest in addressing as part of his vision for Twitter’s work environment is employees’ ability to work remotely, which could carry its own legal implications. His suggestion that remote work would be reserved only for exceptional employees on a case-by-case basis, specifically, may make it more difficult for Twitter to maintain that in-person work is an essential function of a given job, Ortbals said. “That would be potentially concerning to me in the sense that, if you’re going to allow some employees to work remotely based on their job performance, then it’s harder for me to claim that being there in-person is an essential function of a typical employee’s job,” he explained. As a practical matter, Ortbals said that Musk’s internal communication with workers “doesn’t seem to be designed to create a collaborative work environment or even an environment necessarily where the employees at Twitter feel valued. But frankly, that might have been the intent.” For the full article, please click here."

The Associated Press  November 14, 2022, 6:27 PM WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Testimony began Monday in a Delaware courtroom where a Tesla shareholder is challenging a compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk potentially worth more than $55 billion.  The lawsuit alleges that the performance-based stock option grant was negotiated by a compensation committee and approved in 2018 by Tesla board members who had conflicts of interest due to personal and professional ties to Musk.  The lawsuit, filed in 2018, also alleges that the shareholder vote to approve that compensation was based on an incomplete and misleading proxy statement. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that proxy wrongly described members of the compensation committee as “independent,” and characterized all the milestones that triggered vesting in the stock options as “stretch” goals meant to be difficult to achieve, even though internal projections indicated that three operational milestones were likely to be achieved within 18 months of the stockholder vote.  “Any action by stockholders based on a materially misleading proxy is a nullity and the grant fails,” according to a brief by the plaintiff’s attorneys. Attorneys for the defendants countered in their pretrial brief that two institutional proxy advisers noted that the plan would require “significant and perhaps historic achievements” and require growth that “appear stretching by any benchmark.” The first witness to testify was Ira Ehrenpreis, a prominent venture capitalist and longtime friend of Musk who chaired Tesla’s compensation committee when the grant was formulated. Under the plan, Musk stood to reap billions if the electric car and solar panel maker hit certain market capitalization and operational milestones. For each of incidence of simultaneously meeting a market cap milestone and an operational milestone, Musk, who already owned about 22% of Tesla when the plan was approved, would get stock equal to 1% of outstanding shares at the time of the grant. His interest in the company would grow to about 28% if the company’s market capitalization grew by $600 billion. Each milestone in the plan includes expanding Tesla’s market capitalization by $50 billion and meeting an aggressive revenue or pretax profit growth target. Musk stood to receive the full benefit of the pay plan, $55.8 billion, only if Tesla hit a market capitalization of $650 billion and unprecedented revenues and earnings within a decade. To date, Tesla has achieved all 12 of the market capitalization milestones and 11 of the operational milestones, resulting in the vesting of 11 of the grant’s 12 installments and providing Musk over $52.4B in stock option gains, according to the lawsuit. Since the grant was awarded, Tesla’s market capitalization has increased from $59 billion to more than $690 billion, having briefly hit $1 trillion early this year.  Shares of Tesla Inc. have been battered this year, like all automakers, due to a mix of backed-up supply chains and soaring inflation. Tesla shares have fallen 46% this year, while shares of Ford and GM have fallen around 31%.  However, the Austin, Texas, company earned $5.5 billion in 2021, blowing away the previous year’s profit of $721 million. It also produced a record 936,000 vehicles, nearly double what the company rolled off the assembly line in 2020. Ehrenpreis testified that much of Tesla’s success has been the result of Musk’s leadership, which he said combined bold vision with “a maniacal focus on execution.” “He has both a bold vision, but he has been as hard working a CEO as there can be,” Ehrenpreis said. Under questioning from defense attorney Evan Chesler, Ehrenpreis described the nearly yearlong process under which he and other directors discussed and developed the compensation plan with the help of legal advisers and independent consultants, as well as input from major institutional investors. Ehrenpreis described the milestones in the plans as “extraordinarily ambitious and difficult.” According to minutes from a 2017 meeting of the compensation committee, the directors wanted to properly balance the motivation of “stretch” goals for Musk while avoiding “demotivating factors created by seemingly impractical, unrealistic or unachievable goals.” Ehrenpreis also testified that his friendship with Musk played no role in his vote to approve the plan. “I felt that it was very important to ensure Elon’s leadership in this next chapter of the company’s life,” he said, adding it was the kind of ambitious plan that drives Musk and would create one of the most valuable companies in the world. Also testifying Monday was Todd Maron, Tesla’s former general counsel. Maron testified that Musk never dictated terms of the plan, but that the process was cooperative and collaborative, “not a knock-down, drag-out affair.” “There would be times when the board wanted something and Elon didn’t,” he said. In his cross-examination of Maron, plaintiff attorney Jeroen van Kwawegen questioned whether the compensation plan was even needed to keep Musk as the helm, noting that there is no evidence he has ever thought about leaving Tesla. “I intend to be actively involved with Tesla for the rest of my life,” Musk said in analyst call in May 2017, just weeks after work on the new compensation plan began. Plaintiff’s attorneys pointed to an email to Maron in July 2017 in which Musk said he wanted to use proceeds from the new compensation plan to help finance his dream of colonizing Mars. Testimony resumes Tuesday morning. Copyright

Musk tweets: I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2022 Musk puts the buyout deal on hold following reports that 5% of Twitter’s daily active users are spam accounts. Musk tweets: To find out, my team will do a random sample of 100 followers of @twitter.  I invite others to repeat the same process and see what they discover … — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 14, 2022 In a letter from Musk’s attorney sent to Twitter, Musk threatens to terminate his agreement. Musk alleges Twitter is refusing to comply with requests for data on the number of spam accounts. Twitter’s board complies with Musk’s demands, agreeing to provide him with a “firehose” data stream of tweets. This was first reported by The Washington Post. Musk announces his intention to terminate the Twitter acquisition, claiming in a filing with the SEC that Twitter still refuses to comply with requests for data on bot accounts. Twitter’s chairman, Bret Taylor, says that the board plans to pursue legal action to enforce the agreement. The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery. — Bret Taylor (@btaylor) July 8, 2022 Twitter formally launches a lawsuit against Musk in response to his backing out of the acquisition.

A separate report says Musk plans to offer verification checkmarks through Twitter Blue and increase the price to $19.99 per month. In an exchange on Twitter with Stephen King, Musk confirms plans to charge for verification, though at a reduced price of $8 per month. We need to pay the bills somehow! Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers. How about $8? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 1, 2022 In a follow-up tweet, Musk adds: “I will explain the rationale in longer form before this is implemented. It is the only way to defeat the bots & trolls.” Musk reportedly orders Twitter staff to work 12-hour shifts to accomplish his goal of launching the new verification system within a week. Musk lays off half of Twitter employees as part of an alleged cost-cutting measure. On Twitter, Musk says the layoffs are due to a massive drop in company revenue: Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists. Extremely messed up! They’re trying to destroy free speech in America. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 4, 2022 Regarding the layoffs, Musk claims he has no choice: Regarding Twitter’s reduction in force, unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day.

Musk reportedly believes Twitter doesn’t have the cash flow to survive, mentioning that bankruptcy is possible. Musk pauses Twitter Blue subscriptions due to accounts abusing the verification checkmark by impersonating brands and public figures.

Hij is de oprichter van SpaceX en medebedenker en -oprichter van Zip2. Musk is CEO van Tesla, waar hij zich een jaar na de oprichting bijvoegde. Hij mag zich ook oprichter van Tesla noemen, zoals afgesproken met de andere oprichters.[2][3] Hij is de oprichter van x.com. Dit bedrijf werd later gefuseerd met Confinity Inc. tot PayPal. Hij is algemeen directeur (CEO) en chief designer (CDO) van SpaceX, algemeen directeur en productarchitect van Tesla en was tot de overname door Tesla voorzitter van SolarCity. In 2022 kocht hij Twitter (X),[4] waar hij de controle heeft.[5] 
Musk haalde de internationale pers met de ideeën voor een hyperloop en een VTOL supersonisch elektrisch vliegtuig. 
In 2022 was Musk volgens Forbes de rijkste persoon op aarde.[6] 
Musk is geboren op 28 juni 1971 in Pretoria, Zuid-Afrika, zoon van een Canadees model en een Zuid-Afrikaans elektromechanisch ingenieur, piloot, zeeman, consultant, project-ontwikkelaar, en voor de helft eigenaar van een Zambiaanse smaragd-mijn nabij het Tanganyikameer.[7][8] Zijn grootmoeder van vaderskant was Brits en hij heeft ook Pennsylvania-Duitse wortels. Na de scheiding van zijn ouders in 1980 woonde Musk vooral bij zijn vader. 
Op tienjarige leeftijd ontdekte hij de Commodore VIC-20. Hij leerde zichzelf programmeren en verkocht op twaalfjarige leeftijd een BASIC-videospel genaamd Blastar aan het tijdschrift PC and Office Technology voor ongeveer 500 dollar. 
Musk ging in eerste instantie naar de privéschool Waterkloof House Preparatory School. Hij deed eindexamen aan de Pretoria Boys High School en verhuisde naar Canada in juni 1989, vlak voor zijn achttiende verjaardag, nadat hij een Canadees burgerschap ontving via zijn moeder. 
In 1989 werd Musk toegelaten tot Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[9] In 1992, na twee jaar gestudeerd te hebben aan Queen's University, vertrok Musk naar de Universiteit van Pennsylvania waar hij op 24-jarige leeftijd een Bachelor of Science-diploma in Natuurkunde van Penn's College of Arts and Sciences haalde en een Bachelor of Arts Economie aan de Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Musk bleef nog een jaar om een tweede bachelor te behalen. Tijdens zijn studie aan University of Pennsylvania kochten Musk en mede-student Adeo Ressi een studentenhuis om dit als nachtclub te gebruiken. In 1995, 24 jaar oud, verhuisde Musk naar Californië om in de natuurkunde te promoveren aan Stanford University, maar verliet de universiteit na twee dagen om zelf bedrijven op te richten op het gebied van internet, duurzame energie en de ruimte. In 2002 kreeg hij het Amerikaanse staatsburgerschap. 
In 1995 richtten Musk en zijn broer Kimbal Zip2, een internetbedrijf, op. Ze deden dit met investeringen van een groep business angels.[10] Het bedrijf ontwikkelde een online stadsgids voor onder andere kranten. Musk contracteerde The New York Times en de Chicago Tribune. Tijdens zijn tijd bij Zip2 wilde Elon algemeen directeur worden van het bedrijf, maar hier ging geen enkel lid van de raad van commissarissen van Zip2 mee akkoord. Compaq nam Zip2 over voor 307 miljoen Amerikaanse dollars waarvan Musk 7% ontving, wat neerkwam op 22 miljoen dollar. 
In maart 1999 richtte Musk X.com op, een online betaalplatform. Hij investeerde hier 10 miljoen dollar in. Een jaar later werd dit bedrijf samengevoegd met Confinity, dat ook een betaalplatform had, genaamd PayPal. Het samengevoegde bedrijf richtte zich op de diensten die PayPal al had en ging in 2001 door onder diezelfde naam. PayPals vroege groei werd gedreven door een actie waarbij nieuwe klanten geld kregen bij registratie. PayPal werd overgenomen door eBay in oktober 2002, voor anderhalf miljard dollar, waarvan Musk 165 miljoen ontving. Musk was met 11,7% van de aandelen de grootste aandeelhouder van PayPal voor de overname. 
In 2001 creëerde Musk het concept ""Mars Oasis""; een project om een kleine experimentele broeikas met voedingsgewassen te laten landen op Mars om publieke interesse te wekken in ruimte-exploratie. Musk reisde in oktober 2001 met Jim Cantrell en Adeo Ressi naar Moskou om gebruikte ICBM's te kopen die spullen de ruimte in zouden kunnen schieten. De groep vergaderde onder andere met NPO Lavochkin en Kosmotras, maar zij namen Musk niet serieus. Ze vertrokken zonder ICBM's. De groep kwam terug naar Rusland in februari 2002 voor drie ICBM's. Dit keer namen ze Mike Griffin mee, die in het verleden[(sinds) wanneer?] werkte voor de CIA, NASA en kort daarvoor Orbital Sciences, een maker van satellieten en ruimtevoertuigen, had verlaten. De groep ontmoette Kosmotras opnieuw en er werd dit keer één raket aangeboden voor 8 miljoen Amerikaanse dollar, maar dit vond Musk te duur en hij verliet meteen de vergadering. Op de vlucht terug uit Moskou realiseerde Musk zich dat hij een bedrijf zou kunnen oprichten voor de productie van betaalbare raketten. Volgens Steve Jurvetson, vroege investeerder van Tesla en SpaceX, berekende Musk dat de kostprijs van de materialen om de raket te maken slechts 3% was van de toenmalige verkoopprijs. Door toepassing van verticale integratie en een modulaire benadering van de software kan SpaceX de kosten met een tienvoud verlagen en een marge van 70% handhaven. Musk richtte SpaceX uiteindelijk op met de langetermijnvisie om een bevolking in de ruimte te creëren. 
Met 100 miljoen Amerikaanse dollars van zijn eerdere verkopen richtte Musk in juni 2002 Space Exploration Technologies, ofwel SpaceX, op. Musk is de algemeen directeur en Chief Designer van het bedrijf, dat zijn hoofdkwartier in Hawthorne, California heeft staan. SpaceX ontwikkelt en produceert ruimtelanceringstoestellen met een focus op het verder brengen van rakettechnologie. De eerste twee rakettypen van het bedrijf zijn de Falcon 1 die tussen 2006 en 2009 vijf maal (waarvan de laatste twee succesvol) werd gelanceerd en de Falcon 9, die tot oktober 2018 62 keer werd gelanceerd met één mislukking tijdens de twintigste vlucht in juni 2015. De raket voor 29e vlucht explodeerde twee dagen voor de geplande lancering inclusief de vracht tijdens een voorbereidende test. 
De naam van de SpaceX-raketten is een knipoog naar Star Wars' Millennium Falcon. Het eerste ruimteschip van SpaceX is de Dragon (een knipoog naar Puff the magic dragon). In zeven jaar tijd heeft SpaceX de productgroepen Falcon, draagraketten en het Dragon ruimteschip gecreëerd, waarvan de laatste voor meerdere doelen ingezet kan worden. Toen in 2008 voor de derde keer een Falcon 1-lancering mislukte stond SpaceX aan de rand van de afgrond. Musk heeft toen zijn laatste privékapitaal geïnvesteerd om nog één poging te doen. Bij een nieuwe mislukking zouden zowel SpaceX als Musk bankroet zijn geweest. In september 2008 echter slaagde SpaceX erin een dummy-lading in een baan om de aarde te brengen. Op 13 juli 2009 werd de vijfde Falcon 1-raket van SpaceX de eerste raket met vloeibare brandstof van een privébedrijf die een commerciële satelliet in een baan om de aarde bracht. Hierna werden alle Falcon 1-operaties gestopt ten behoeve van de veel grotere Falcon 9 die in 2010 voor het eerst vloog. 
Op 25 mei 2012 schreef SpaceX opnieuw historie, ditmaal met het Dragon-ruimtetoestel, dat als eerste ruimtetoestel van een commercieel bedrijf het Internationale ruimtestation ISS bereikte. SpaceX werd in 2006 voor een Commercial Orbital Transportation Servicen (COTS)-contract van NASA geselecteerd om een nieuw lanceringstoestel, de Falcon 9, te ontwikkelen om lading naar het ruimtestation te vervoeren gevolgd door een Commercial Resupply Services-contract van NASA ter waarde van 1,6 miljard Amerikaanse dollars op 23 december 2008, voor 12 vluchten van de Falcon 9-raket en het Dragon-ruimschip naar het Internationale ruimtestation ISS. SpaceX is een van de twee bedrijven met een CRS-1-contract om het ruimtestation van nieuwe lading te voorzien, dat daarmee de Space Shuttle vervangt. SpaceX is tevens een van de drie geselecteerden voor het CRS-2-contract. Astronautentransport naar het ISS werd van 2011 tot 2018 exclusief verzorgd door de Sojoez ruimtecapsule, Sinds 2014 is SpaceX een van de twee bedrijven in NASA's Commercial Crew-programma om astronautentransport te ontwikkelen. SpaceX tracht vanaf 2019 astronauten naar het ISS te vliegen met de Dragon 2. 
SpaceX is zowel het grootste private lanceerbedrijf ter wereld, als recordhouder van de hoogste stuwkracht-gewichtsverhouding ooit gemeten. Binnen twee jaar had SpaceX meer dan 100 operationele Merlin 1D-motoren geproduceerd, momenteel 's werelds effectiefste raketmotor. De 9 Merlin-motoren die gebruikt worden in het eerste deel van de Falcon 9 produceren een stuwkracht van 7.607 tot 8.227 kiloNewton. 
De Foundation-boekenreeks van Isaac Asimov heeft een grote invloed gehad op Musk. Musk ziet ruimte-exploratie als een belangrijke stap in het uitbreiden, al dan niet behouden, van het menselijk leven. Musk zei dat multi-planetair leven een oplossing kan zijn voor het bedreigde voortbestaan van de mens op aarde. 
""Een asteroïde of een enorme vulkaan kan ons vernietigen, er zijn bedreigingen voor ons die dinosaurussen niet hadden: een door ons zelf gemaakt virus, een per ongeluk gecreëerd micro-zwart gat, catastrofale opwarming van de aarde of een nog onbekende technologie die het einde van ons bestaan kan betekenen. Het menselijk ras heeft zich miljoenen jaren ontwikkeld, maar in de laatste 60 jaar zijn er atoombommen gecreëerd die de wereld kunnen vernietigen. Vroeg of laat zullen we ons ras uitbreiden naar meer planeten dan alleen de aarde, of uitsterven.""  Zijn doel is de kosten van bemande ruimtevaart te verlagen met een factor 10. In een interview in 2011 zei Musk dat hij hoopt binnen 10 of 20 jaar mensen naar Mars te kunnen sturen. In de biografie van Musk, geschreven door Ashlee Vance, onthult hij dat hij een kolonie op Mars wil hebben rond 2040, met een populatie van 80.000 personen. 
In 2015 werden de plannen voor Starlink bekend: een satellietnetwerk voor het aanbieden van internetdiensten. Eind 2020 waren reeds meer dan 800 Starlinksatellieten in de ruimte en ging een publiek beta-testprogramma van start in het noorden van de Verenigde Staten, Canada en Nieuw-Zeeland. 
In 2016 presenteerde Musk zijn eerste conceptontwerp voor wat later Starship zou worden. Dat zal bestaan uit een draagraket en een groot ruimteschip die een stuk groter zijn dan de mensheid tot nog toe gebouwd heeft. In 2017 en 2018 werden herziene ontwerpen gepresenteerd. Starship is geschikt voor alle type lanceringen en per lancering goedkoper dan kleinere raketten omdat deze volledig, snel en veelvuldig herbruikbaar is. In 2018 is begonnen met de bouw van het eerste prototype voor Starship dat in 2019 enkele korte testvluchten van maximaal 150 meter maakte. De ontwikkeling van de Raptor-motoren van het Starship is zo goed als afgerond. Het is echter te verwachten dat deze in de loop der tijd nog worden verbeterd, net als bij de Merlin-motoren werd gedaan. In 2020 werden drie atmosferische testvluchten met Starship-prototypes ondernomen. In 2021 zal men hiermee doorgaan, totdat er een ruimtewaardig prototype is en suborbitale en later orbitale (test) ruimtevluchten kunnen worden ondernomen. 
In 2018 vloog de Falcon Heavy voor het eerst. Het was op dat moment de krachtigste beschikbare raket op aarde. De lanceerprijzen liggen echter veel lager dan bij de concurrentie. De ontwikkeling had vijf jaar langer geduurd dan vooraf voorspeld. 
SpaceX is het eerste bedrijf dat standaard lanceerprijzen openlijk op zijn website heeft gepubliceerd. 
Tesla, Inc. werd in juli 2003 opgericht als Tesla Motors door Martin Eberhard en Marc Tarpenning, die het bedrijf financierden tot de eerste financieringsronde. Beide mannen bekleedden een actieve rol in de vroege ontwikkeling van het bedrijf, voordat Elon Musk betrokken werd bij het bedrijf. Musk leidde de eerste financieringsronde in februari 2004, toen hij toetrad als voorzitter van de raad van bestuur. Musk had een actieve rol in het bedrijf en was tot in detail betrokken bij het design van de Tesla Roadster, maar was minder betrokken bij de dagelijkse gang van zaken. 
Tijdens de financiële crisis van 2008 voelde Musk zich genoodzaakt het leiderschap van Tesla over te nemen als algemeen directeur en Chief Designer, posities die hij vandaag de dag[(sinds) wanneer?] nog bekleedt. Tesla produceerde eerst een elektrische sportauto, de Tesla Roadster, waarvan ongeveer 2.500 voertuigen aan 31 landen werden verkocht. Tesla kwam vervolgens op 22 juni 2012 met de Model S, een vierdeurssedan, en introduceerde zijn derde auto, de Model X, gericht op de SUV/minivan-markt, op 9 februari 2012.
Naast eigen auto's verkoopt Tesla ook elektrische aandrijfsystemen aan Daimler voor de Smart EV, Mercedes B-Class Electric Drive en Mercedes A Class en aan Toyota voor de RAV4 EV. Musk kon beide bedrijven binnenhalen als langetermijninvesteerders in Tesla. 
Musk observeert een productie demo van de heropening van de NUMMI fabriek, nu[(sinds) wanneer?] de fabriek van Tesla (Fremont, California) in 2010 
Musk staand voor een Tesla Model S in 2011 
Musk en Senator Dianne Feinstein naast een Tesla Model S in 2010 
Het is Musks doel een subcompacte auto in de prijsklasse onder 30.000 dollar te produceren en elektrische aandrijfsystemen te blijven leveren aan andere autoproducenten, zodat zij betaalbare elektrische auto's kunnen maken zonder een duur intern ontwikkel-proces te moeten opzetten. Verschillende publicaties hebben Musk met Henry Ford vergeleken om zijn ontwikkeling van voertuig-aandrijfsystemen. 
Om de nadelen van de beperkte actieradius van elektrische auto's te verminderen is Tesla zijn netwerk van snellaadstations drastisch aan het uitbreiden, zei Musk in een interview met All Things Digital in mei 2013. Musk voegde daar aan toe dat het aantal superchargers aan de oost- en westkust van de Verenigde Staten verdrievoudigd moet zijn rond juni, waarbij de rest van Noord-Amerika, inclusief Canada, ook naar een uitbreiding kon uitkijken, later dat jaar. Musk zou 32% van de aandelen van Tesla bezitten, wat in november 2013 neerkwam op 18 miljard Amerikaanse dollars. Terwijl Musk in 2012 een jaarlijks salaris van 78,2 miljoen Amerikaanse dollars ontving, is sinds 2014 zijn salaris één dollar, en daarmee vergelijkbaar met dat van onder andere Steve Jobs. Het overige deel bestaat uit aandelen en prestatie-gebonden bonussen. 
In 2014 kondigde Musk aan dat Tesla Motors andere bedrijven toestaat om hun patenten te gebruiken, zo lang dat meehelpt om de ontwikkeling van elektrische voertuigen te versnellen. ""De ongelukkige werkelijkheid is dat het ontwikkelingsprogramma van elektrische auto's (of van andere voertuigen die ook geen koolwaterstoffen verbranden) bij de grote autoproducenten klein tot niet-bestaand is, wat neerkomt op een gemiddelde van veel minder dan 1% van hun autoverkopen"" zei Musk. 
Musk kwam met het eerste concept en financiële middelen voor SolarCity, dat hij in 2006 oprichtte met zijn neven Lyndon en Peter Rive. 
De onderliggende motivatie voor de investeringen in SolarCity en Tesla is om de opwarming van de aarde tegen te gaan. Musk kondigde in 2012 aan dat SolarCity en Tesla samenwerken om elektrische batterijen te gaan gebruiken om de opwekking van energie via zonnepanelen te verbeteren. Dit programma werd actief in 2013. 
Op 17 juni 2014 kondigde Musk aan dat SolarCity een geavanceerde productiefaciliteit zou gaan bouwen in Buffalo, New York. Deze nieuwe productiefaciliteit zou drie keer zo groot worden als de tot dan toe grootste in de Verenigde Staten. Musk voegde daar aan toe dat dit ""een van de grootste zonnepaneelfabrieken in de wereld"" zou zijn en in de komende jaren gevolgd zou worden door nog grotere fabrieken. 
In juni 2016 maakte Tesla Motors een overnamebod bekend op SolarCity.[11] Musk gaf als argument dat Tesla auto’s op elektriciteit rijden en dat nu[(sinds) wanneer?] ook de productie van de voertuigen mogelijk is zonder gebruik te maken van fossiele brandstoffen.[11] Het overnamebod heeft een waarde van US$ 2,5 à 3 miljard.[11] Op het nieuws schoot de aandelenkoers van SolarCity met een derde omhoog, maar de koers van Tesla Motors daalde die dag met zo’n 15%.[11] Musk had op het moment van het bod een aandelenbelang van 23% in SolarCity en van 21% in Tesla Motors.[12] 
Op 12 augustus 2013 gaf Musk voor het eerst een concept weer van een systeem waarmee met hoge snelheid personen vervoerd kunnen worden tussen Los Angeles en San Francisco, omdat hij teleurgesteld was dat het California High-Speed Rail-systeem was goedgekeurd. Musk noemde zijn idee ""hyperloop"", een hypothetisch voertuig dat zich door een lageluchtdrukbuis beweegt van ongeveer 560 kilometer lang. Dit is enigszins vergelijkbaar met buizenpost. Dit systeem zou mensen moeten vervoeren tussen Sylmar (een noordelijk district in Los Angeles) en Hayward (ten oosten van San Francisco) in minder dan 35 minuten, wat sneller is dan wat commerciële luchtvaartmaatschappijen momenteel aanbieden. Musks idee zou, indien technisch haalbaar tegen de geraamde kosten, reizen goedkoper maken dan iedere andere vorm van lange afstandstransport die nu[(sinds) wanneer?] beschikbaar is. In het voorgestelde systeem heerst een partieel vacuüm dat de luchtweerstand verlaagt, waardoor in theorie met een relatief laag vermogen hoge snelheden kunnen worden gehaald. Musk heeft de kosten van de hyperloop op 6 miljard Amerikaanse dollars geschat. 
Er zijn verschillende niet aan Musk gerelateerde initiatieven tot ontwikkeling van een hyperloop ontstaan. 
Zo is het bedrijf 'Hyperloop Transportation Technologies' een overeenkomst aangegaan met Quay Valley, Californië, een stad tussen Los Angeles en San Francisco, om een hyperloop-baan van 8 kilometer om een deel van de stad heen te bouwen. De bouw hiervan begint volgens de planning in 2016. Het bedrijf Hyperloop One werkt eveneens aan een hyperloop en ook in Nederland wordt gekeken naar mogelijkheden voor een hyperloop. Het Delftse Hardt Hyperloop lanceerde op 12 september 2018 plannen voor een verbinding tussen Schiphol en Frankfurt. 
Eind 2016 begon Musk een nieuw bedrijf genaamd The Boring Company (TBC). Doel is om een goedkopere tunnelboortechniek te ontwikkelen en vervolgens een tunnelnetwerk aan te leggen dat aansluit op het wegennetwerk. Door gebruik te maken van liften en een railsysteem in de tunnels, moeten automobilisten sneller tussen de drukke stedelijke gebieden en de buitenwijken kunnen reizen om zo verkeersinfarcten te voorkomen. 
Begin 2017 werden tunnelboortests met een aangekochte tunnelboor uitgevoerd op het terrein van SpaceX in Hawthorn. Eind 2018 opende TBC zijn eerste test-tunnel in Hawthorn. In deze tunnel van 3,2 kilometer kunnen mensen in “pods” met een snelheid van 240 kilometer per uur over de rails vervoerd worden. Eerder in 2018 werden enkele contracten voor het aanleggen van tunnels gesloten. Van grond die uit de tunnels komt worden ter plekke betonnen bouwstenen gemaakt die wat vorm betreft aan grote legostenen doen denken. Deze worden vervolgens weer verkocht. De grond-afvoertreinen van TBC werken op accu's en hebben daardoor geen giftige uitstoot, wat de veiligheid voor medewerkers vergroot. Deze treinen zijn in samenwerking met Tesla ontwikkeld. 
Op 14 maart 2022 werd Musk met 9,1% de grootste aandeelhouder van het beursgenoteerde socialemediabedrijf Twitter Inc.[13] In april 2022 trachtte Musk het bedrijf volledig over te nemen. Op 25 april aanvaardde Twitter zijn bod van 44 miljard dollar onder voorbehoud van goedkeuringen van overheden, marktwaakhonden en aandeelhouders.[14] In juli trok Musk zijn bod in waardoor Twitter hem voor de rechtbank daagde. Eind oktober ging de overname alsnog door.[15] 
Politiek gezien beschrijft Musk zichzelf als een 'half-democraat' en 'half-republikein'. Musk zegt zelf ""Ik sta in het midden van het politieke spectrum, tussen sociaal liberalisme en fiscaal conservatisme.""[bron?] 
Musk heeft zijn bewondering uitgesproken voor voormalig Brits premier Margaret Thatcher; ""Ik heb Margaret Thatcher altijd bewonderd – ze was streng, maar ook gevoelig en eerlijk"", waaraan hij toevoegde: ""ze was zeker niet perfect, maar haar acties, gemiddeld genomen, waren goed"".[bron?] 
Musk beschrijft zichzelf als een Amerikaans exceptionalist en nationalist. Volgens Musk is de Verenigde Staten ""ongetwijfeld het beste land dat ooit op aarde heeft bestaan"". Musk gelooft dat ""zonder de Verenigde Staten, de democratie niet zou hebben bestaan"" waarna hij refereert aan ""drie verschillende momenten in de twintigste eeuw waarop de democratie gevallen zou zijn zonder de Verenigde Staten"", waarmee hij doelt op de Eerste Wereldoorlog, Tweede Wereldoorlog en de Koude Oorlog.[bron?] 
In een interview met de Washington Post[bron?] vertelde Musk dat hij ""een significante donor (hoewel niet een van de grootste) is van de Democratische partij, maar dat hij ook veel geld heeft gegeven aan de Republikeinse partij"". Musk vertelde verder dat ""als je gehoord wilt worden in Washington, je een kleine bijdrage zal moeten geven."" 
Een rapport uit 2012 van de Sunlight Foundation (een niet politiek gepositioneerde partij die de uitgaven van de overheid bijhoudt), beweerde dat ""SpaceX meer dan 4 miljoen Amerikaanse dollars heeft uitgegeven aan lobbyen en meer dan 800.000 Amerikaanse dollars heeft gestort in de partijkas"" van zowel de Democraten als de Republikeinen. Ditzelfde rapport gaf ook aan dat ""SpaceX’ campagne om politieke steun te verkrijgen systematisch en verfijnd in elkaar zit"", en dat ""in tegenstelling tot vele technologie start-ups, SpaceX sinds dag één een significante aanwezigheid in Washington heeft gehad"". Het rapport voegde toe dat Musk persoonlijk sinds 2002 ongeveer 725.000 Amerikaanse dollars heeft gedoneerd aan verschillende campagnes.[16] 
Musk heeft het politiek actiecomité FWD.us gesteund, dat werd opgericht door mede-ondernemer Mark Zuckerberg en steunt immigratiehervorming, maar in mei 2013 trok hij zijn steun terug wegens de reclame van het PAC die de Keystone Pipeline prees. Musk en andere leden, waaronder David O. Sacks, trokken zich terug, nadat ze de strategie bekritiseerden als ""cynisch"". Musk zei verder: ""we moeten ons niet overgeven aan de politiek. Als we dat doen, krijgen we het politieke systeem dat we verdienen"". Musk werd na deze uitspraak door politieke website Mic bestempeld als totaal hypocriet voor het lobbyen en ondersteunen van ""anti-wetenschap Republikeinen"". Musk gaf volgens hen in de verkiezingsronde van 2014 financiële steun aan Longhorn PAC en de Nationale Republikeinse Comité – die op hun beurt beiden anti-wetenschap, anti-milieu kandidaten zoals Michelle Bachman steunden. Het artikel geeft ook aan dat ""deze politieke beslissingen Musk's sociaal-bewuste visie tegengaan"". Musk heeft ook politici zoals de Republikeinse senator Marco Rubio, die soortgelijke ideeën over klimaatverandering heeft, financieel gesteund. 
Musk heeft aangegeven dat hij niet langer vindt dat de Amerikaanse overheid subsidies moet geven aan milieu-bewuste bedrijven, zoals dat eerder met Tesla Motors en SolarCity gebeurde. De overheid zou in plaats daarvan taks op kooldioxide moeten invoeren, om ""slecht gedrag"" te ontmoedigen. Musk vindt dat de vrije markt ""de beste oplossing biedt"" en dat het produceren van milieu-onvriendelijke voertuigen consequenties moet hebben. 
Musks ideeën zijn wijd en zijd bekritiseerd. Professor Fred Turner, van Stanford, zei: ""Als je een ondernemer als Elon Musk bent, pak je geld wanneer dat kan, maar geloof je tegelijkertijd dat technologie en ondernemerschap bronnen van sociale verandering zijn, niet de staat. Het is geen zelfbedrog, maar het is een gewoonte om te denken dat je een onafhankelijk persoon bent en niet te erkennen dat je subsidie hebt ontvangen. Dit komt veel voor in Silicon Valley"". Schrijver Michael Shellenberger gaf aan dat ""in het geval van Musk het moeilijk is om dat niet op te vatten als verdedigend. Ik denk dat er een zakelijke strategie achter zit. Ze doen namelijk veel zaken met investeerders die subsidies niet als een levensvatbare bedrijfsvorm zien op lange termijn, waardoor bedrijven graag overdrijven hoe onafhankelijk ze van de subsidies kunnen opereren"". Shellenberger vervolgt met: ""het zou voor ons allemaal beter zijn als deze ondernemers wat dankbaarder en nederiger zouden zijn"". Jim Motavalli, journalist en schrijver die Musk interviewde voor zijn boek over elektrische auto's genaamd High Voltage, vertelde dat ""Elon kijkt vanuit de positie van een winnaar en dat hij niet wil dat andere mensen winnen door het krijgen van overheidsgelden. Ik denk dat mensen de neiging hebben om de ladder achter zich omhoog te trekken, nadat ze succes hebben behaald"". 
In 2015 werd het commentaar van Musk verder bekritiseerd, toen een artikel van de LA Times onthulde dat SpaceX, Tesla en SolarCity samen naar schatting ongeveer 4,9 miljard Amerikaanse dollars hadden ontvangen in de vorm van subsidies. Het artikel voegde daar aan toe dat Tesla en SolarCity afhankelijk zijn van subsidies en jaarlijks verlies lijden, en trekt hun zelfstandigheid in twijfel. Verschillende analisten noemden ook de grote hoeveelheden staatssteun de overeenkomst tussen Musks drie bedrijven, waarna analist Dan Dolev over Musk zei dat hij ""de plekken opzoekt waar staatssubsidies te krijgen zijn"". 
Musk, een oude tegenstander van short-selling, heeft herhaaldelijk kritiek geuit op de praktijk en beweerde dat het illegaal zou moeten zijn. Er wordt gespeculeerd dat Musk's oppositie tegen short-selling voortkomt uit de manier waarop short-sellers vaak oppositieonderzoek organiseren en publiceren over de bedrijven die volgens hen momenteel overgewaardeerd zijn. Begin 2021 moedigde hij de GameStop short squeeze aan. Musk heeft ook regelmatig cryptocurrencies gepromoot, waarbij hij stelt dat hij ze ondersteunt boven traditionele door de overheid uitgegeven fiat-valuta's. Gezien de vluchtige effecten die zijn tweets erover hebben, zijn zijn uitspraken over cryptocurrencies door critici zoals Nouriel Roubini gezien als marktmanipulaties. 
Musk ontmoette zijn eerste echtgenote, de Canadese schrijfster Jennifer Justine Wilson, tijdens hun gezamenlijke schooltijd op Queen's University in Ontario. Ze trouwden in 2000 en gingen uit elkaar in 2008. Samen kregen ze zes kinderen. Hun eerste kind overleed aan wiegendood toen hij tien weken oud was. Hierna kregen ze nog vijf kinderen, een tweeling en een drieling, door middel van IVF. In 2010 trouwde Musk met de Britse actrice Talulah Riley. In 2012 gaf Musk aan dat hij de relatie met Riley had beëindigd. In juli 2013 hertrouwden Musk en Riley. In december 2014 vroeg Musk opnieuw een scheiding aan voor het huwelijk met Riley. 
Van 2017 tot 2018 had de zakenman een relatie met actrice Amber Heard. 
In 2020 werden Musk en zijn vriendin, zangeres Grimes, ouders van een jongen. In 2022 kregen beiden een dochter met behulp van een draagmoeder en later nog een zoontje, waarvan zijn bestaan pas in 2023 bekend werd[17]. In 2021 kreeg Musk een tweeling samen met een topmanager van Neuralink[18], een bedrijf waarvan Musk een van de oprichters en (in 2022) de CEO is. 
Musk is de voorzitter van de Musk Foundation, die zich richt op filantropische acties omtrent zonnepanelen in rampgebieden. De Musk Foundation werkte in 2010 samen met SolarCity en doneerde een 25 kW zonnepaneelsysteem aan het South Bay Community Alliance (SBCA) orkaanreactiecentrum in Coden, Alabama. De Musk Foundation doneerde in juli 2011 250.000 Amerikaanse dollars aan een zonnepaneeltechnologieproject in Soma, Fukushima, een Japanse stad die verwoest was door een tsunami. 
In juli 2014 werd Musk gevraagd door Matthew Inman, een cartoonist en verre neef van Nikola Tesla, om 8 miljoen Amerikaanse dollars te doneren voor de opbouw van het Tesla Science Center. Uiteindelijk ging Musk ermee akkoord een miljoen Amerikaanse dollar te doneren en beloofde een Tesla-snellaadstation in de parkeerplaats van het museum te plaatsen. 
In januari 2015 doneerde Musk 10 miljoen Amerikaanse dollar aan het Future of Life Institute om een wereldwijd onderzoek op te zetten, gericht op het gunstig houden van kunstmatige intelligentie voor de mens. 
In oktober 2018 maakte Musk een half miljoen dollar over om waterzuiveringsinstallaties in de scholen van Flint te plaatsen zodat het lood uit het vergiftigde leidingwater wordt gefilterd. 
In oktober 2019 doneerde hij 1 miljoen dollar aan Teamtrees om bomen te planten. 
Sinds 2015 is Musk een onderdeel van de X Prize Foundation. Op 21 januari 2021 beloofde Musk een prijs van honderd miljoen dollar aan degene die met het beste ontwerp voor technologie ten behoeve van het grootschalig afvangen van koolstofdioxide komt.[19] Deze competitie werd X Prize Carbon Removal gedoopt. 
Musk maakt graag grappen over Jeff Bezos die met zijn bedrijf Blue Origin in de toekomst direct met SpaceX concurreert. Zo is de uitspraak van Musk “Jeff Who?” een bekende “meme” op sociale media geworden (die in 2021 door Richard Branson werd herhaald[20]). Toen Bezos een satellietennetwerk voor internet onder de vlag van Amazon aankondigde dat direct met SpaceX Starlink-netwerk concurreert reageerde Musk met “Copycat”. Andersom feliciteerde Bezos Musk op ludieke wijze met “Welcome to the club” toen SpaceX er anderhalve maand na Blue Origin in slaagde een raket te laten landen, ook al was Musks raket vele malen groter en ging deze veel hoger en sneller. Minder ludiek was dat Blue Origin meende een patent op “raketlandingen op een schip” te hebben[21] en SpaceX daarop aanklaagde. Die zaak werd uiteindelijk door Blue ingetrokken omdat SpaceX een reeds verlopen patent wist op te duiken.[22] Het idee kwam bovendien ook al voor in de Sovjet-sciencefictionfilm Nebo Zovyot uit 1959 die in een Amerikaanse aangepaste versie uit 1962 bekend is onder de titel Battle beyond the Sun. Ook tekende Bezos meermaals bezwaar aan tegen de hoeveelheid Starlinksatellieten die SpaceX in de ruimte heeft omdat deze de plannen voor zijn eigen toekomstige satellietnetwerk Project Kuiper zouden dwarsbomen.

Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News    Elon Musk is no longer the world’s richest person, according to Forbes.
   
      On Thursday, Musk dropped to the second spot on Forbes’ list of “Real-Time Billionaires,” putting the Twitter and Tesla CEO behind Bernard Arnault, CEO of French luxury brand LVMH, maker of Louis Vuitton luxury goods and Hennessy cognac. Forbes now pins Musk’s wealth at $183.6 billion, slightly below Arnault’s wealth estimated at $186.2 billion.
   
Forbes noted on Wednesday that Arnault’s ascent is because LVMH’s stock is mostly flat this year, while Musk has experienced a “dramatic collapse of Tesla’s share price,” which is down 56% in 2022. Musk’s strategy of cavorting with right-wing influencers on Twitter may also be impacting Tesla shares as well. Musk’s wealth peaked in November 2021, when he was worth $320 billion, Forbes said.
   
      Musk recently sold off about $4 billion of Tesla stock to fund his $44 billion purchase of Twitter, which is embroiled with issues including layoffs and skittish advertisers wary of the platform’s direction. Musk had sold blocks of Tesla shares worth a total of $15.4 billion earlier this year when his deal to buy Twitter was announced. 
   
      Estimating Musk’s wealth in general is a difficult task, however, as much of his money is tied up in his private companies, including rocket and internet firm SpaceX, tunneling outfit The Boring Company, and Neuralink, which wants to put computer chips in people’s brains.
   
      Despite the losses, Musk is well ahead of third-place Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, who is worth $135 billion and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, whose wealth is estimated at $113.1 billion.
   
      On Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, Musk is solidly in first place with a net worth of $171 billion. Arnault sits in second with a $166 billion net worth. However, Musk has lost about $100 billion this year, according to Bloomberg’s calculations. That list updates daily after the market closes.

Twitter headquarters is shown in San Francisco on Nov. 4, 2022. Twitter relaunched its Twitter Blue subscription service on Monday, where users can pay a monthly fee for a blue checkmark, along with the ability to edit tweets and upload high-quality video. The company said most new features would be immediately available to subscribers, but when an NPR reporter tried it early Monday afternoon, most features were not available. There appeared to be other hiccups, too. People attempting to subscribe on Twitter's website were being directed to sign up through Twitter's app for Apple devices â€” where the program costs more. Later on Monday, the subscription was available through Twitter's website. Hours after the relaunch, Twitter disbanded its Trust and Safety Council, exacerbating concerns about new owner Elon Musk's approach to protecting the platform's users. The outside group of civil rights and human rights organizations, which advises Twitter on issues from hate speech and child exploitation to mental health and suicide prevention, was scheduled to meet on Monday with Twitter executives, including the company's new head of trust and safety. But less than an hour before, they received an email announcing the council's dissolution, according to several council members who requested anonymity because of concerns of retaliation. ""As Twitter moves into a new phase, we are reevaluating how best to bring external insights into our product and policy development work. As part of this process, we have decided that the Trust and Safety Council is not the best structure to do this,"" the email, signed by ""Twitter,"" said. These moves are the latest by Musk away from policies and procedures the company has spent years developing to curb problems on the platform, from harassment and abuse to spam. Twitter is charging $11 a month for subscriptions purchased on iPhones and iPads, compared with $8 a month through Twitter's website. Apple generally levies a 30% commission on in-app transactions processed through Apple's App Store, which, it appears, Twitter is passing on to subscribers.  The company has not explained the price difference. But Twitter owner Elon Musk had leveled sharp words at Apple over its so-called ""Apple tax,"" a longtime pain point for app developers and cause of concern for regulators around the world who have viewed the fee as excessive and financially damaging to Apple's rivals.  Musk has since claimed his row with Apple was resolved following a meeting with the company's chief executive, Tim Cook, at Apple's Cupertino headquarters. Twitter has introduced a color-coded system for people, companies and governments: Gold is for companies; gray for governments and blue for individuals. The gray marks will be available later this week, Twitter said in a tweet.  Rather than simply giving blue checkmarks to all individual subscribers, Twitter says there is a process, or as Twitter project manager Esther Crawford put it in a tweet this past weekend, ""a review step before applying a blue checkmark to an account as one of our new steps to combat impersonation."" This is an about-face for the company. Before Musk bought Twitter in October, the blue checkmarks signified that the company had verified a user's identity. When Musk first attempted to include the blue checkmarks as part of the subscription, Twitter was flooded with fake accounts. Advertisers, politicians and even Musk himself were impersonated. The chaos forced the billionaire to put the service on pause after just two days. Twitter acknowledges the confusion on its help page: ""Now the blue checkmark may mean two different things: either that an account was verified under the previous verification criteria (active and authentic), or that the account has an active subscription to Twitter Blue.""  When Musk first conceived of the plan to let people buy the once-coveted and restricted blue checkmarks, he was met with internal resistance from Twitter's trust and safety experts. They feared the move would be weaponized by those looking to spread disinformation, including repressive regimes hoping to disseminate propaganda. Musk ignored them. Twitter's Trust and Safety team, like others at the company, had been gutted through layoffs and resignations. The dissolution of the advisory council on Monday represented a further step away from the rules and policies that the company had used before Musk's takeover in October.  Musk views Twitter Blue as part of his mission to make money on the platform in ways other than advertising, which accounts for about 90% of Twitter's revenue. But since Musk's chaotic reign began in late October, major advertisers have been fleeing in droves. Twitter has long struggled to grow its service the way larger competitors like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok have and, even before Musk took over, the company's advertising business had been far from robust. Musk has floated bankruptcy as a possible option for Twitter. Musk has said before an account can receive a checkmark, it will be manually verified, though he has not fully explained how the process would work.  Twitter has spelled out some new criteria for Twitter Blue, including having an account older than 90 days and having a phone number that the company can confirm.  In addition, the company says if a subscriber changes their handle, display name, or photo, they will temporary lose their checkmark until the profile authenticity is confirmed. Musk on Monday tweeted that everyone who previously received a verified blue check would ""in a few months"" be stripped of it, writing: ""The way in which they were given out was corrupt and nonsensical."" Twitter has not answered questions about whether it still has the resources to take on such a daunting task after laying off more than half of the company's staff. ""With a reduced workforce, it remains to be seen if it will be possible to prevent fraud, impersonation and scams with their new identity verification methodology,"" Rachel Tobac, the CEO of the cybersecurity firm SocialProof Security, previously told NPR. ""Scammers will quickly determine how they can overwhelm or manipulate the identity verification system to get 'authenticated' as an entity that they are not."" Twitter, which no longer has a communications staff, did not respond to a request for comment. Editor's Note: This story has been updated to reflect the fact that Twitter Blue has been launched.

Speaking of buzz, few people have been generating more of it lately than Elon Musk, who leads Tesla, SpaceX, and now Twitter, among other ...","ChatGPT has been making waves this week following its test release by OpenAI, the company behind it. The artificial intelligence chatbot has evoked amazed, amused, and concerned reactions to it and generally created major buzz on social media. Many have speculated ChatGPT will disrupt Google’s search business. It can also debug code, write in a famous author’s voice, and help students cheat, among many other things. The buzz will likely ramp up even more when OpenAI releases a superior next version of the A.I. chatbot, reportedly sometime next year. Speaking of buzz, few people have been generating more of it lately than Elon Musk, who leads Tesla, SpaceX, and now Twitter, among other companies. As it turns out, Musk has ties to OpenAI, including as an original backer, and has been involved in both supporting artificial intelligence and warning about its dangers.  This month Musk called ChatGPT “scary good” and warned, “We are not far from dangerously strong AI.”  ChatGPT is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI. Musk resigned from OpenAI’s board of directors in 2018, citing possible conflicts of interest because of Tesla’s own A.I. work. In 2019, OpenAI changed from a nonprofit to a “capped profit” corporation, a hybrid of a for-profit and nonprofit. In 2019 it received a $1 billion investment from Microsoft. By 2020, Musk tweeted, “I have no control & only very limited insight into OpenAI,” adding his confidence in its safety was “not high.”  This month he tweeted: “I just learned that OpenAI had access to Twitter database for training. I put that on pause for now. Need to understand more about governance structure & revenue plans going forward. OpenAI was started as open-source & non-profit. Neither are still true.” But we’ll let ChatGPT itself talk more about Musk’s history with OpenAI. The rest of this article was written by the A.I. chatbot, generated in seconds as answers to our questions: Elon Musk has had a long relationship with OpenAI, dating back to the organization’s founding in 2015. He was one of the original backers of the organization, providing both financial and strategic support. Over the years, he has remained an advocate for the organization and its mission to promote and develop friendly AI. Based on his public statements and actions, it appears that he has some concerns about the potential dangers of advanced AI and its potential impact on society. He has often spoken about the need for AI to be developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner, and has even founded organizations such as OpenAI to help advance this goal. Elon Musk has publicly expressed concerns about the potential dangers of advanced AI. In particular, he has warned about the risk of AI being used for malicious purposes, such as to develop weapons or to interfere with elections. He has also expressed concern about the potential for AI to surpass human intelligence and become a threat to humanity. Tesla uses AI in several of its products and services. For example, the company’s Autopilot feature uses AI to help vehicles navigate roads and highways with limited or no input from the driver. The company’s cars also use AI for tasks such as lane detection, adaptive cruise control, and automatic emergency braking. Additionally, Tesla is using AI in its manufacturing processes to help improve efficiency and productivity. It is possible that Elon Musk has hired employees from OpenAI, but I do not have access to that information as I am a large language model trained by OpenAI and do not have the ability to browse the internet. OpenAI is an independent organization, and while Elon Musk has been involved with the organization in the past, he is not directly involved in its day-to-day operations or decision-making.  © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Twitter suspends journalists who have been covering Elon Musk and the company. Musk joined a Twitter Space to say the suspensions were related ..."," Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time Twitter on Thursday evening suddenly suspended several high-profile journalists who cover the platform and Elon Musk, one of the richest people in the world, who acquired the company just a few months ago.  Hours after the suspensions took hold, Musk faced off with one of the journalists he suspended in a Twitter Space audio discussion before an audience of more than 30,000 listeners. The suspended journalist, along with several others, found a backdoor way onto the platform through the website's audio function. “You doxx, you get suspended. End of story. That's it,” Musk said, explaining his latest policy to the group, before he left minutes after having joined the discussion.  Musk was referring to Twitter's latest rule change about accounts that track private jets, including one owned by Musk himself, which was put in place Wednesday.   The audio discussion and the Twitter’s Spaces feature was abruptly shut down after Musk exited the conversation. Musk tweeted, ""we're fixing a Legacy bug. Should be working tomorrow.""  The discussion revolved around the suspension of numerous journalists. The accounts of Ryan Mac of The New York Times, Donie O'Sullivan of CNN, Drew Harwell of The Washington Post, Matt Binder of Mashable, Micah Lee of The Intercept, Steve Herman of Voice of America and independent journalists Aaron Rupar, Keith Olbermann and Tony Webster had all been suspended as of Thursday evening. The Twitter account for Mastodon, a platform billed as a Twitter alternative, was also suspended early Thursday evening. Twitter accounts operated by NBC News journalists were unable to tweet any links to Mastodon pages. Mastodon was, however, trending on Twitter. Musk said the suspensions stemmed from the platform's new rules banning private jet trackers, responding to a tweet from Mike Solana, a vice president of the venture capital firm Founders Fund, who noted that the suspended accounts had posted links to jet trackers on other websites. ""Criticizing me all day long is totally fine, but doxxing my real-time location and endangering my family is not,"" he said in another tweet. Musk tweeted that the accounts banned Thursday posted ""my exact real-time location, basically assassination coordinates, in (obvious) direct violation of Twitter terms of service."" NBC News was unable to verify that allegation. Musk later added that the suspensions would last seven days. In early November, shortly after having taken control of Twitter, Musk tweeted that he would not ban the account that tracked his jet. Rupar wrote on Substack that his account was permanently suspended but that he had no other information.  ""I haven’t heard anything from Twitter at all,"" he wrote. He noted that he had tweeted a link Wednesday to a Facebook page that tracked Musk’s jet. Binder, a tech reporter at Mashable, said he was suspended after he tweeted a screenshot from another suspended reporter, CNN’s O’Sullivan, of a Los Angeles Police Department statement. ""I’ve been on it since 2008. I never got so much as a slap on the wrist, because I always follow the rules,"" Binder said. ""It’s not hard to do when you know what the rules are."" Binder said his account notified him that he is permanently suspended.  ""This is the very stuff that he’s criticized the previous Twitter of doing,"" Binder said of Musk. Binder did appear to find a loophole in Twitter's suspension, joining an audio discussion on Twitter's Spaces feature with other journalists Thursday night. Harwell later also joined. ""I'm breaking the law in ways that have never been broken before,"" Binder joked. Jack Sweeney, a 20-year-old Florida college student who created the Twitter account that tracked Musk's jet, was also able to join the discussion despite his account's suspension. Musk later joined the discussion, but briefly — getting out his talking points and then leaving abruptly. He had earlier put up a poll with a variety of options, asking whether or when he should reinstate the journalists’ accounts. When a plurality of respondents voted to restore the accounts immediately, he deleted the poll and started a new one with fewer options. O’Sullivan said Thursday that all those journalists who were suspended with him were people who cover Musk. “As we saw with the jet tracker last night, Musk seems to be just stamping out accounts that he doesn’t like,” O’Sullivan said on CNN. A spokesperson for the network said the suspensions were “impulsive and unjustified” — but not surprising.  “Twitter’s increasing instability and volatility should be of incredible concern for everyone who uses Twitter,” the network said in a statement. “We have asked Twitter for an explanation, and we will reevaluate our relationship based on that response.” Sally Buzbee, the executive editor of The Washington Post, said Harwell’s suspension “directly undermines Elon Musk’s claim that he intends to run Twitter as a platform dedicated to free speech.” Harwell was “banished from Twitter without warning, process or explanation, following the publication of his accurate reporting about Musk” and should be reinstated immediately, Buzbee said in a statement Thursday night. A spokesperson for The New York Times, who called the suspensions questionable and unfortunate, said no explanation was provided to Mac or the newspaper about the ban.  Rep. Lori Trahan, D-Mass., tweeted that she had met on Thursday with Twitter representatives, who said the company would not take action against journalists who criticize the platform. ""Less than 12 hours later, multiple technology reporters have been suspended. What’s the deal, @elonmusk?"" Trahan added. Musk has backtracked on his promise that he would run Twitter as a free speech absolutist, reinstating accounts associated with the QAnon movement and other far-right groups while banning others.  Internally, he has removed critics of his policies from the company.  The suspensions add to what has been a tumultuous couple of days for Twitter after it first suspended the account that tracked Musk’s jet. Musk appeared to threaten legal action against Sweeney, the creator of the @ElonJet account, after he claimed that a “stalker” confronted a car carrying his child in Los Angeles on Tuesday. Musk provided no proof that Sweeney or his account was involved. He did not provide a time or location in the sprawling metropolitan area where he claimed the incident occurred. Sweeney told NBC News on Wednesday that he hasn’t received any notification of legal action and that the last time his bot tweeted anything was Monday, “which is not last night, so I don’t get how that’s connected.” The Los Angeles Police Department said Thursday that no police reports had been filed. “LAPD’s Threat Management Unit is aware of the situation and tweet by Elon Musk and is in contact with his representatives and security team. No crime reports have been filed yet,” Officer Lizeth Lomeli, a police public information officer, said in a statement Thursday evening. Other law enforcement departments also cover parts of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. CORRECTION (Friday, Dec. 16, 12:30 a.m.): A previous version of this article misspelled the last name of a Los Angeles police public information officer. She is Lizeth Lomeli, not Loeni.

He ceded that title to LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault at the close on Monday, according to Forbes. Tesla shares closed down about 6.3% for the day, and have more than halved in value this year partially due to a sell-off that accelerated in the wake of Musk's $44 billion Twitter acquisition. Musk's wealth, mostly tied to Tesla stock, was propelled by a meteoric rise in the carmaker's share price, which rocketed more than 1,000% in two years. Arnault, through holding vehicles and family trusts, owns a little over 60% of LVMH's voting share class, according to SEC filings. Arnault is worth $186.2 billion, according to Forbes. According to FactSet data, Musk presently owns 14.11% of Tesla's outstanding shares, with a market value of $530 billion. Musk also owns more than 40% of SpaceX shares, adding billions on paper to his net worth, based on a $125 billion private market valuation from June 2022. In a down year for stocks, LVMH shares have dropped just 1.5% in 2022. LVMH is based in Paris and is listed on Euronext Paris. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which uses slightly different methodologies, was updated on Tuesday to also rank Musk's fortune behind Arnault.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/elon-musks-resignation-twitter-hell-give-control-experts/story?id=95649617,Does Elon Musk's resignation from Twitter mean he'll give up control ...,20221201,"Dec 22, 2022 ... The billionaire entrepreneur, who owns Twitter, said on Tuesday that he will step down as soon as the company identifies a successor. The move ...","Musk's vow to step down amounts to ""window dressing,"" one expert said. Elon Musk vowed to resign as the head of Twitter but he will remain a dominant force at the company, some management experts told ABC News. The billionaire entrepreneur, who owns Twitter, said on Tuesday that he will step down as soon as the company identifies a successor. The move follows a Twitter poll in which a majority of users called on Musk to stop leading the company. However, he will retain control over the software and server departments, important teams that will grant him significant control over how the social media platform operates. The authority afforded by ownership of the company, as well as Musk's longstanding reluctance to delegate key tasks, will result in decisions dictated largely by his preferences, the experts said. The company, which lacks a board of directors, will likely hire a hand-picked successor with views that align closely with Musk's and a public profile that is vanishingly small by comparison, they added.  ""It will be Elon's impulse to jump in and say, 'It's my money at stake, it's my reputation at stake – I have to be a part of every decision,'' Peter Harms, a professor of management at the University of Alabama who has studied corporate leadership, told ABC News. ""He has shown no inclination to delegate authority with his businesses,"" Harms added. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Since he acquired Twitter, Musk has made dramatic changes. He fired top executives and cut the company's 7,500-person workforce in half, while reinstating some formerly suspended accounts such as that belonging to former President Donald Trump. He also revamped Twitter's subscription service, Twitter Blue, allowing users to access verification if they pay a monthly fee of $8. The service was suspended after it gave rise to a flood of fake accounts impersonating public figures and brands. It has since been relaunched.  In an interview on Twitter Spaces on Tuesday, Musk defended the moves as part of an aggressive effort to rescue Twitter from financial peril, which he described as an ""emergency fire drill."" ""That's the reason for my actions,"" he added. ""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever."" ​​Musk, who admitted he overpaid for the platform at the purchasing price of $44 billion, said last month that the company was losing $4 million a day. In his latest eye-catching move, Musk posted a poll on the platform asking users whether he should resign. The poll ended Monday morning, with 57.5% of voters saying he should step down and 42.5% saying he shouldn't. After a day of silence about the results, Musk announced that he would ultimately step down. By retaining control of key product teams, however, Musk will remain heavily involved in overseeing the company, experts said. ""It feels like window dressing,"" Sandra Sucher, a professor of management at Harvard Business School, told ABC News. ""He can appear to be responding to the vote to get him out, but I think it's somewhat disingenuous because he's going to maintain operational control over a big portion of the business."" ""There's no question that he will remain the de facto head,"" she added. ""As far as concerns over decision making and the way he's shaping the business to reflex his own personal views, it's unclear what this change will do."" Musk, who also runs electric vehicle company Tesla, has faced growing pressure to return his focus to the automaker. The company's stock has fallen 60% this year, as it faces heightened competition and pandemic-induced production challenges. Musk's resignation ""has become a necessity because of the hemorrhaging at Tesla,"" Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor of management at Yale University who convenes gatherings of top CEOs, told ABC News. While Musk will remain atop Twitter for the foreseeable future, he may end up distancing himself from the company in order to prioritize the comparatively massive automaker, which boasts a market capitalization of nearly $440 billion, Sonnenfeld said. In fact, Musk tried to avoid taking control of Twitter in the first place. He tried to pull out of the deal to buy the company but went through with the acquisition after Twitter brought a lawsuit forcing the acquisition. ""He became CEO by default because he lost the lawsuit,"" said Sonnenfeld, of Yale University. ""He didn't really want to be CEO. Despite the need for a steady hand at Tesla, Musk will find it difficult to disengage from day-to-day operations at Twitter, said Harms, of the University of Alabama. ""He'll struggle to relinquish control,"" he said.  A successor, Harms said, would need to implement Musk's vision for the company and allow Musk to take credit, leaving little opportunity for dissent. The current dynamic atop Twitter – a visionary leader in need of a logistics-oriented partner – has come about in the industry on multiple occasions, Harms said, pointing to former Apple CEO Steve Jobs and his then-second-in-command Tim Cook. In another case, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hired Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to handle the company's advertising business, on which it relies for revenue.

He ceded that title to LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault at the close on Monday, according to Forbes. Tesla shares closed down about 6.3% for the day, and have more than halved in value this year partially due to a sell-off that accelerated in the wake of Musk's $44 billion Twitter acquisition. Musk's wealth, mostly tied to Tesla stock, was propelled by a meteoric rise in the carmaker's share price, which rocketed more than 1,000% in two years. Arnault, through holding vehicles and family trusts, owns a little over 60% of LVMH's voting share class, according to SEC filings. Arnault is worth $186.2 billion, according to Forbes. According to FactSet data, Musk presently owns 14.11% of Tesla's outstanding shares, with a market value of $530 billion. Musk also owns more than 40% of SpaceX shares, adding billions on paper to his net worth, based on a $125 billion private market valuation from June 2022. In a down year for stocks, LVMH shares have dropped just 1.5% in 2022. LVMH is based in Paris and is listed on Euronext Paris. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which uses slightly different methodologies, was updated on Tuesday to also rank Musk's fortune behind Arnault.

Twitter headquarters is shown in San Francisco on Nov. 4, 2022. Twitter relaunched its Twitter Blue subscription service on Monday, where users can pay a monthly fee for a blue checkmark, along with the ability to edit tweets and upload high-quality video. The company said most new features would be immediately available to subscribers, but when an NPR reporter tried it early Monday afternoon, most features were not available. There appeared to be other hiccups, too. People attempting to subscribe on Twitter's website were being directed to sign up through Twitter's app for Apple devices â€” where the program costs more. Later on Monday, the subscription was available through Twitter's website. Hours after the relaunch, Twitter disbanded its Trust and Safety Council, exacerbating concerns about new owner Elon Musk's approach to protecting the platform's users. The outside group of civil rights and human rights organizations, which advises Twitter on issues from hate speech and child exploitation to mental health and suicide prevention, was scheduled to meet on Monday with Twitter executives, including the company's new head of trust and safety. But less than an hour before, they received an email announcing the council's dissolution, according to several council members who requested anonymity because of concerns of retaliation. ""As Twitter moves into a new phase, we are reevaluating how best to bring external insights into our product and policy development work. As part of this process, we have decided that the Trust and Safety Council is not the best structure to do this,"" the email, signed by ""Twitter,"" said. These moves are the latest by Musk away from policies and procedures the company has spent years developing to curb problems on the platform, from harassment and abuse to spam. Twitter is charging $11 a month for subscriptions purchased on iPhones and iPads, compared with $8 a month through Twitter's website. Apple generally levies a 30% commission on in-app transactions processed through Apple's App Store, which, it appears, Twitter is passing on to subscribers.  The company has not explained the price difference. But Twitter owner Elon Musk had leveled sharp words at Apple over its so-called ""Apple tax,"" a longtime pain point for app developers and cause of concern for regulators around the world who have viewed the fee as excessive and financially damaging to Apple's rivals.  Musk has since claimed his row with Apple was resolved following a meeting with the company's chief executive, Tim Cook, at Apple's Cupertino headquarters. Twitter has introduced a color-coded system for people, companies and governments: Gold is for companies; gray for governments and blue for individuals. The gray marks will be available later this week, Twitter said in a tweet.  Rather than simply giving blue checkmarks to all individual subscribers, Twitter says there is a process, or as Twitter project manager Esther Crawford put it in a tweet this past weekend, ""a review step before applying a blue checkmark to an account as one of our new steps to combat impersonation."" This is an about-face for the company. Before Musk bought Twitter in October, the blue checkmarks signified that the company had verified a user's identity. When Musk first attempted to include the blue checkmarks as part of the subscription, Twitter was flooded with fake accounts. Advertisers, politicians and even Musk himself were impersonated. The chaos forced the billionaire to put the service on pause after just two days. Twitter acknowledges the confusion on its help page: ""Now the blue checkmark may mean two different things: either that an account was verified under the previous verification criteria (active and authentic), or that the account has an active subscription to Twitter Blue.""  When Musk first conceived of the plan to let people buy the once-coveted and restricted blue checkmarks, he was met with internal resistance from Twitter's trust and safety experts. They feared the move would be weaponized by those looking to spread disinformation, including repressive regimes hoping to disseminate propaganda. Musk ignored them. Twitter's Trust and Safety team, like others at the company, had been gutted through layoffs and resignations. The dissolution of the advisory council on Monday represented a further step away from the rules and policies that the company had used before Musk's takeover in October.  Musk views Twitter Blue as part of his mission to make money on the platform in ways other than advertising, which accounts for about 90% of Twitter's revenue. But since Musk's chaotic reign began in late October, major advertisers have been fleeing in droves. Twitter has long struggled to grow its service the way larger competitors like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok have and, even before Musk took over, the company's advertising business had been far from robust. Musk has floated bankruptcy as a possible option for Twitter. Musk has said before an account can receive a checkmark, it will be manually verified, though he has not fully explained how the process would work.  Twitter has spelled out some new criteria for Twitter Blue, including having an account older than 90 days and having a phone number that the company can confirm.  In addition, the company says if a subscriber changes their handle, display name, or photo, they will temporary lose their checkmark until the profile authenticity is confirmed. Musk on Monday tweeted that everyone who previously received a verified blue check would ""in a few months"" be stripped of it, writing: ""The way in which they were given out was corrupt and nonsensical."" Twitter has not answered questions about whether it still has the resources to take on such a daunting task after laying off more than half of the company's staff. ""With a reduced workforce, it remains to be seen if it will be possible to prevent fraud, impersonation and scams with their new identity verification methodology,"" Rachel Tobac, the CEO of the cybersecurity firm SocialProof Security, previously told NPR. ""Scammers will quickly determine how they can overwhelm or manipulate the identity verification system to get 'authenticated' as an entity that they are not."" Twitter, which no longer has a communications staff, did not respond to a request for comment. Editor's Note: This story has been updated to reflect the fact that Twitter Blue has been launched.

Elon Musk: Twitter users vote in favour of boss resigning ... Twitter users have voted in favour of Elon Musk stepping down as the platform's ...","Twitter users have voted in favour of Elon Musk stepping down as the platform's chief executive after the billionaire ran a poll on his future. A total of 57.5% voted ""yes"" after Mr Musk asked his 122 million followers whether he should stand down. Mr Musk, who bought Twitter for $44bn (£36bn), said before the poll closed that he would abide by the result. The technology tycoon, who also runs Tesla and Space X, has faced much criticism since taking over the site. Mr Musk is yet to comment since the poll closed. Even if he were to resign as chief executive, he would remain as Twitter's owner. More than 17.5 million users voted in his poll on Monday, with 42.5% voting no to Mr Musk stepping down. In the past Mr Musk has obeyed Twitter polls. He's fond of quoting the phrase ""vox populi, vox dei"", a Latin phrase which roughly means ""the voice of the people is the voice of God"".

A former Twitter member of staff, who left the company recently, told the BBC that Mr Musk was ""showing himself to be the incompetent fool we all knew he was"". Speaking on condition of anonymity, they added: ""His investors are surely looking at this now and questioning whether he was the right horse to back. ""I imagine he's getting pressure from investors to step down and is using this poll to make it look like he's following the will of the people instead of the will of those paying his bills."" Minutes before the poll closed, the founder of crypto exchange Binance replied to Mr Musk saying he should ""stay the course"" and not step down. Changpeng Zhao is thought to be one of several Twitter investors and said in May he had backed Mr Musk taking over by making a $500m investment. Among the backers are massive firms such as Fidelity, which is known for managing retirement accounts, and Sequoia Capital, which has backed other technology firms Apple, Google and Airbnb. Others are thought to be Oracle co-founder and Mr Musk's friend, Larry Ellison, sovereign wealth fund Qatar Holding, and Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Mr Musk's private jet appears to be on its way back from the World Cup in Qatar, where he was pictured at the final next to Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner on Sunday. Dan Ives, senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, told the BBC before the poll closed that he believed the vote would ultimately lead to the ending of Mr Musk's reign as Twitter chief executive, and that he would probably name a new temporary CEO ""in the next 24 hours"". There has been a flurry of controversial changes at Twitter since Mr Musk bought the social media site.  He has fired about half of its staff and attempted a rollout of Twitter's paid-for verification feature before putting it on pause. The feature was relaunched last week.  He has also been criticised for his approach to content moderation, with some civil liberties groups accusing him of taking steps that will increase hate speech and misinformation. On Friday, Mr Musk was condemned by the United Nations and European Union over Twitter's decision to suspend some journalists who cover the social media firm. The UN tweeted that media freedom is ""not a toy"", while the EU threatened Twitter with sanctions. After starting the poll, Mr Musk tweeted: ""As the saying goes, be careful what you wish, as you might get it."" He added later: ""Those who want power are the ones who least deserve it."" 
27 October 2022 
Musk completes his $44bn (£38.1bn) takeover of Twitter, immediately firing a number of the company’s top executives and tweeting ""the bird is freed"". Before officially taking charge of the company, Musk changed his Twitter profile to read ""Chief Twit"" and turned up to Twitter HQ in San Francisco carrying a sink, saying: ""Let that sink in!"" 
29 October 
After a surge in tweets containing racist language, Twitter’s head of trust and safety says: ""Hateful conduct has no place here."" Yoel Roth says the company is taking action against users ""involved in this trolling campaign"" to make Twitter safe and welcoming for everyone. 
30 October 
Musk tweets an article containing a number of inaccuracies about an attack on the husband of US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi by a hammer-wielding intruder. The site has a history of publishing inaccurate stories and Musk later deletes the tweet after a backlash. 
31 October 
With just over a week to go before the US midterm elections, Musk responds to questions about whether he will reinstate former President Donald Trump’s account on Twitter by tweeting: ""If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if Trump is coming back on this platform, Twitter would be minting money!"" Later that day, Musk attended a halloween party in New York and posed for photographs wearing a ""Devil’s champion"" costume. 
1 November 
Following reports that Twitter will begin charging users to have verified accounts, Musk responds to criticism from author Stephen King by saying: ""We need to pay the bills somehow!"". 
4 November 
Employees at the company begin receiving emails entitled ""Your Role at Twitter"" informing them whether they have lost their jobs. Responding to news about the layoffs, Musk says ""unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day"". Yoel Roth, the head of trust and safety, said 50% of the company’s nearly 8,000 employees had been laid off but sought to reassure users and advertisers that the platform’s moderation capacity remained intact. 
5 November 
Twitter co-founder and ex-CEO Jack Dorsey breaks his silence over the Musk takeover to apologise to staff who have lost their jobs, saying: ""I own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation: I grew the company size too quickly."" 
6 November 
Musk announces that Twitter accounts impersonating people without being clearly labelled a parody will be permanently suspended - a change to the previous process when accounts were given a warning first. A number of accounts that changed their name to ""Elon Musk"" and mocked the billionaire had already been suspended or placed behind a warning sign. 
9 November 
In his first email to Twitter staff, Musk warns that the ""economic picture ahead is dire"" and adds: ""Without significant subscription revenue, there is a good chance Twitter will not survive the upcoming economic downturn."" Meanwhile, after the launch of the $8-a-month Twitter Blue subscription, which gives paying users a blue tick, a slew of parody accounts that appear to be verified emerge, including a fake George W Bush account that tweets: ""I miss killing Iraqis"". Within days, the service is paused. 
10 November 
More high-profile staff quit, including head of trust and safety Yoel Roth and chief security officer Lea Kissner. 
12 November 
Reports in US media say thousands of contractors who had been working for Twitter have had their contracts terminated. Technology news site Platformer says as many as 80% of its 5,500 contractor workforce were laid off in the move but the company made no official announcement. 
16 November 
In a late-night email to all Twitter staff, Musk says employees must commit to a ""hardcore"" culture of working ""long hours at high intensity"" or leave the company. 
17 November 
In a surprise announcement, Twitter says its company offices will be closed temporarily. The move comes amid reports that large numbers of Twitter staff had resigned. Responding to fears the platform was about to shut down due to losing key staff, Musk tweeted: ""The best people are staying, so I’m not super worried."" 
12 December 
The paid-for verification feature Twitter Blue is relaunched. It is still $8 per month - but Twitter cranks it up to $11 for those using the app on Apple devices. Musk says he resents the commission fee Apple charges on in-app purchases. 
15 December 
Musk says he is taking legal action against the holder of the @ElonJet Twitter account that tracks his private jet, claiming it put his son at risk. He also suspends the accounts of reporters for the New York Times, CNN and the Washington Post, among others, saying they had shared his location. After condemnation from the UN, a threat of sanctions from the European Union, and a Twitter poll, Musk lifts the suspension for the journalists’ accounts, saying ""the people have spoken"". The @ElonJet account remains suspended. 
18 December 
Twitter users vote in favour of Musk stepping down as its chief executive after he ran a poll on his future, promising he would ""abide by the results"". Millions voted, with a final total of 57.5% saying ""yes"". 
21 December 
Responding to the poll, Musk says he will resign as Twitter's chief executive officer when he finds someone ""foolish enough to take the job"". He says he will still run the software and servers teams after his replacement is found. Earlier on Sunday, Twitter said it would shut down accounts solely designed to promote other social media platforms.  However, Mr Musk later tweeted that major policy changes for the site would be voted on in the future. The web page detailing the policy towards other social media platforms appears to no longer exist. Mr Ives said the last few weeks and months had been a ""black eye for Musk and a black eye for Tesla"", which he said was the ""golden child"" because it is where most of the billionaire's wealth is. Mr Musk's electric car firm has fallen sharply in value, with some saying his obsession with Twitter is destroying the brand. Last week, Leo KoGuan, the third largest individual shareholder in Tesla, called for Mr Musk to step down as the boss of the electric car maker. ""Elon abandoned Tesla and Tesla has no working CEO. Tesla needs and deserves to have [a] working full time CEO,"" he tweeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

Mr Ives said he believed Mr Musk had realised he ""cannot balance"" being the boss of Twitter as well as his Tesla and space rocket firm SpaceX. ""The biggest problem is the more controversy he creates, advertisers leave and they run for the hills and that's 90% of revenue for Twitter,"" he said. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, added investors at Tesla would be ""closely watching"" Mr Musk's poll. ""Given how much of a distraction Musk's tenure at Twitter has become, shareholders in the electric vehicle manufacturer will be breathing a big sigh of relief if he steps back from Twitter and gets back to the day job at Tesla,"" he said. ""For someone who sets so much store by work ethic, Musk sure seems to spend a lot of time on social media. With Tesla shares having more than halved year-to-date, Musk needs to roll up his sleeves and get his main business back on the road."" Tesla's share price rose nearly 3% at around $154 each on US stock markets in early trading on Monday. However, the shares have lost nearly 60% in value this year.

Twitter has suspended the accounts of journalists who cover the social media platform and its new owner Elon Musk.","Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. FILE - SpaceX’s Elon Musk waves while providing an update on Starship, on Feb. 10, 2022, near Brownsville, Texas. Twitter on Thursday, Dec. 15, 2022, suspended the accounts of journalists who cover the social media platform and Musk, including reporters working for The New York Times, Washington Post, CNN and other publications (Miguel Roberts/The Brownsville Herald via AP, File) Twitter on Thursday suspended the accounts of journalists who cover the social media platform and its new owner Elon Musk, among them reporters working for The New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, Voice of America and other publications. The company hasn’t explained to the journalists why it took down the accounts and made their profiles and past tweets disappear. But Musk took to Twitter on Thursday night to accuse journalists of sharing private information about his whereabouts that he described as “basically assassination coordinates.” He provided no evidence for that claim. The sudden suspension of news reporters followed Musk’s decision Wednesday to permanently ban an account that automatically tracked the flights of his private jet using publicly available data. That also led Twitter to change its rules for all users to prohibit the sharing of another person’s current location without their consent. Several of the reporters suspended Thursday night had been writing about the new policy and Musk’s rationale for imposing it, which involved his allegations about a stalking incident he said affected his family on Tuesday night in Los Angeles. The official account for Mastodon, a decentralized social network billed as an alternative to Twitter, was also banned. The reason was unclear, though it had tweeted about the jet tracking account.   
“Same doxxing rules apply to ‘journalists’ as to everyone else,” Musk tweeted Thursday. He later added: “Criticizing me all day long is totally fine, but doxxing my real-time location and endangering my family is not.” “Doxxing” refers to disclosing online someone’s identity, address, or other personal details. The Washington Post’s executive editor, Sally Buzbee, called for technology reporter Drew Harwell’s Twitter account to be reinstated immediately. The suspension “directly undermines Elon Musk’s claim that he intends to run Twitter as a platform dedicated to free speech,” Buzbee wrote. “Harwell was banished without warning, process or explanation, following the publication of his accurate reporting about Musk.” CNN said in a statement that “the impulsive and unjustified suspension of a number of reporters, including CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan, is concerning but not surprising.” “Twitter’s increasing instability and volatility should be of incredible concern for everyone who uses Twitter,” CNN’s statement added. “We have asked Twitter for an explanation, and we will reevaluate our relationship based on that response.” Another suspended journalist, Matt Binder of the technology news outlet Mashable, said he was banned Thursday night immediately after sharing a screenshot that O’Sullivan had posted before his own suspension.  The screenshot showed a statement from the Los Angeles Police Department sent earlier Thursday to multiple media outlets, including The Associated Press, about how it was in touch with Musk’s representatives about the alleged stalking incident, but that no crime report had yet been filed. “I did not share any location data, as per Twitter’s new terms. Nor did I share any links to ElonJet or other location tracking accounts,” Binder said in an email. “I have been highly critical of Musk but never broke any of Twitter’s listed policies.” Binder said a message he received while trying to access his Twitter account showed that his suspension was permanent. But Musk later suggested the penalty would last a week in response to a question about his suspension of former ESPN and MSNBC host Keith Olbermann. Late Thursday, Musk briefly joined a Twitter Spaces conference chat hosted by journalist Kate Notopoulos of Buzzfeed. He reiterated his claims that the journalists Twitter banned were “doxxing” him when they were reporting on the jet tracking accounts being banned.  “There is not special treatment for journalists,” Musk said, after being asked by the Post’s Drew Harwell if he had a connection between the stalking incident and posting of real-time information.  “You dox, you get suspended, end of story,” he added, before abruptly signing out. The Spaces ended abruptly shortly after 9 p.m. Pacific time.  “Sorry it appears the Space cut out, screen went suddenly blank on my end and everyone got booted,” host Notopoulos tweeted at 9:14 p.m. Pacific.  Another suspended reporter, Steve Herman of Voice of America, said he assumes he was banned “because I was tweeting about other journalists being suspended for tweeting about accounts being booted that had linked to the Elon Jet feed.”  The suspensions come as Musk makes major changes to content moderation on Twitter. He has tried, through the release of selected company documents dubbed as “The Twitter Files,” to claim the platform suppressed right-wing voices under its previous leaders.  He has promised to let free speech reign and has reinstated high-profile accounts that previously broke Twitter’s rules against hateful conduct or harmful misinformation, but also has said he would suppress negativity and hate by depriving some accounts of “freedom of reach.” The nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists, which defends journalists around the world, said Thursday night it was concerned about the suspensions. “If confirmed as retaliation for their work, this would be a serious violation of journalists’ right to report the news without fear of reprisal,” the group said. European Union Commissioner Vera Jourova, who heads up the 27-nation bloc’s work on values and transparency, also weighed in. “News about arbitrary suspension of journalists on Twitter is worrying,” she tweeted. Existing EU media rules and new digital regulations taking effect next year require “respect of media freedom and fundamental rights.” Jourova said, “@elonmusk should be aware of that. There are red lines. And sanctions, soon.”  The Germany government added more criticism. The Foreign Ministry tweeted that it’s “got a problem” with not being able to follow the suspended accounts and added that “press freedom must not be switched on and off at will.” Spokesman Christofer Burger said the ministry opened an account on Mastodon “to ensure we remain reachable.”  Associated Press writers Kelvin Chan in London and Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this report.

The tweet is a cruel and senseless play on pronouns that also invokes the right’s fury toward Anthony Fauci, the chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, for what they believe is a government overreach in public-health policy throughout the pandemic and an obfuscation of the coronavirus’s origins. (Fauci, for his part, has said he would cooperate with any possible investigations and has nothing to hide.) Beyond its stark cruelty, this tweet is incredibly thirsty. As right-wing troll memes go, it is Dad-level, 4chan–Clark Griswold stuff, which is to say it’s desperate engagement bait in the hopes of attracting kudos from the only influencers who give Musk the time of day anymore: right-wing shock jocks. But that is the proper company for the billionaire, because whether or not he wants to admit it, Musk is actively aiding the far right’s political project. He is a right-wing activist. Currently, Musk’s politics are a subject of debate in the press. On Saturday, The New York Times’ Jeremy W. Peters attempted to offer a nuanced portrait of the Twitter owner’s ideologies, arguing that Musk “continues to defy easy political categorization.” But Peters’ laundry list of Musk’s recent lib-trolling and “woke” scolding—such as Musk’s November recommendation to his millions of followers to vote Republican—undermines the very thesis of the article. The nuance Peters is looking for does not exist: Musk’s actions and associations make a clear case that he is a right-wing reactionary. Musk, for his part, has maintained that he is a centrist, that his politics have remained unchanged, and that it is the Democratic Party that has veered dramatically leftward. (Musk and Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) Musk’s logic—that wayward leftism has given a lifelong moderate liberal no choice but to support right-wing causes—is a common trope among far-right activists. It has been employed by many in the so-called Intellectual Dark Web and influencers such as Dave Rubin, Joe Rogan, Glenn Greenwald, and others. The argument stretches far back in American politics. The neoconservative movement in the United States was originated by liberals who grew disillusioned with the Democratic Party, especially in relation to the left’s Vietnam protests. Beyond Musk’s political affiliations, his actual political convictions—by which I mean the bedrock set of values, ideologies, and organizing principles through which he sees the world and wishes it to be structured—are a slightly different conversation. Here, I tend to agree with The Verge’s Liz Lopatto, who wrote recently that Musk doesn’t really have political beliefs, only personal interests. But one can have vapid or nonexistent political beliefs and still be a political activist. Political activism is about actions. Here’s what those actions look like in practice: I am gratified for the reinstatement of my account on Twitter and am grateful to @ElonMusk for his commitment to fairness and free speech.  God Bless America and thank you, Jesus. I affirm your pronouns Elon. Publicly, Musk appears deeply committed to the right’s culture war against progressivism in most forms. His purchase of Twitter was an explicitly political act couched in the notion of preserving free speech. But Musk’s notion of free speech is a broad course correction that involves amplifying and advancing the interests of right-wing reactionaries while trolling the left. Musk might argue that this is restoring balance to the system, but if we are judging based only on actions and outcomes, it is very hard to see his tenure at Twitter as anything other than a series of policies intended to benefit a particular ideology. Musk also simply loves palling around with far-right influencers on Twitter. A scroll through his Twitter replies is a rather remarkable document of a man who has (or at least had) more money than any other human being in the history of humanity, a fair amount of power, and an endless supply of options for how to spend his time, and who chooses to spend his time as a reply guy for prominent MAGA voices, such as a user who goes by the handle @catturd2 and Turning Points USA’s Charlie Kirk. In a similar fashion, Musk’s “Twitter Files” project, for which he has been releasing Twitter’s old internal documents concerning controversial content-moderation decisions to independent journalists, is an attention spectacle dressed up in the style of investigative journalism designed to delight Musk’s Twitter friends. As I wrote on Friday, some of the internal conversations and screenshots from Musk’s company are fascinating documents that shed light on the intractable problem of content moderation at scale. But they are presented in a blatantly partisan and misleading manner, and have been released only to journalists who share Musk’s pet ideological issues: that the mainstream media is ethically bankrupt, that social media and most elite institutions are biased and colluding with the government. The hypocrisy at the center of Musk’s Twitter tenure is crucial to the understanding of Musk’s political activism. He has championed ideals of free-speech maximalism and amnesty to those who’ve offended his rules. Twitter, under his management, has let back on organizers of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia; neo-Nazis such as Andrew Anglin; and January 6–investigation personalities such as Roger Stone. At the same time, Twitter has suspended accounts that have mocked Musk or expressed left-leaning views. Whether intentionally or not, Musk has, in effect, been governing Twitter using the classic Frank Wilhoit maxim: “Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.” Put differently, the billionaire has been advancing a long-running right-wing political project described recently by my colleague Adam Serwer as a “belief in a new constitutional right. Most important, this new right supersedes the free-speech rights of everyone else: the conservative right to post.” Why is Musk doing all of this? The answer is reasonably simple. Musk’s far-right activism clearly seems to be, like all else in his life, personally motivated, not by a strong political ideology or value system but, as Lopatto argues, by the accumulation of money and “being perceived as a visionary who will reshape human society.” Musk is interested in preserving the political values and systems that keep him on top as a revered member of culture. It’s a philosophy that the writer John Ganz has described as “bossism” or “bosses on top.” For Musk, right-wing activism serves that role. Musk’s tweets—like his dismissive tweet this morning, or his concerning insinuations that, perhaps, his former trust-and-safety employees did not stop child-exploitation posts for motivated reasons—are cruel for the shallowest reasons: because they are likely to draw engagement to the platform that Musk has plunged into financial uncertainty, due to both his piling on of debt and his alienation of advertisers. But even as a far-right shitposter, Musk is hapless. Unlike somebody such as Donald Trump, who remains the Twitter troll template, Musk is a try-hard. And although the Twitter shock jocks will happily lap him up because he triggers the libs and serves their purposes, Musk is still seen as a dilettante by the inveterate shitposters and bigots. Over on 4chan, the far-right message board, Musk’s Fauci tweet barely merited discussion. “Elon is just being controversial to drive traffic to his website,” one poster mused. Even in his thirsty attempts to be an edgelord, Musk is failing to be anything other than cringey."

Twitter banned several journalists for talking about an account that let you track Elon Musk's jet. Since then, Musk has been trying to ...","By  Mitchell Clark,  Alex Heath, and  Elizabeth Lopatto Twitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent reporters who cover Elon Musk, including Ryan Mac of The New York Times, CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan, The Washington Post’s Drew Harwell, The Intercept’s Micah Lee, and Mashable’s Matt Binder, Aaron Rupar, and Tony Webster. This evening, Musk logged in to a Twitter Space to try to explain why and ran a poll asking when the journalists should be unbanned — in both instances, things didn’t exactly go his way. The reporters who have been banned all seem to have recently tweeted about Musk’s attempts to crack down on the sharing of the whereabouts of his private jet. Apparently, though, accounts that can’t post can still join a Twitter Spaces live audio chat. In a Space that included Harwell, Binder, and the ElonJet account, Musk eventually tried to explain himself. “You dox, you get suspended. End of story, that’s it.” In that conversation, Musk accused the journalists of “ban evasion.” Once the ElonJet account had been banned from Twitter, its owner set up accounts on Facebook and Mastodon. By posting links to those accounts, he argued, the journalists were trying to get around his ban. The Washington Post’s Harwell asked Musk how Musk’s decision to ban accounts sharing the other ElonJet sites — as well as journalists reporting on the incident — was different from Twitter’s earlier treatment of a New York Post story about a laptop containing Hunter Biden’s personal information. In 2020, Twitter made a moderation decision to block links to The New York Post story. Details on that moderation decision were released on Twitter earlier this month — with Musk’s support. (In April, he tweeted that suspending The New York Post’s account because of the story “was obviously incredibly inappropriate.”) Musk even teased the release of the information by saying “this will be awesome” and tweeting popcorn emoji. In the course of the release, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s email address was revealed.  Musk replied to Harwell by saying, “You dox, you get suspended. End of story, that’s it.” He then left the Space. In an email to The Verge, Twitter head of trust and safety Ella Irwin pointed to a policy update the company made yesterday prohibiting the sharing of “live location information, including information shared on Twitter directly or links to 3rd-party URL(s) of travel routes.” “Without commenting on any specific accounts, I can confirm that we will suspend any accounts that violate our privacy policies and put other users at risk,” Irwin said in the email. “We don’t make exceptions to this policy for journalists or any other accounts.” “We don’t make exceptions to this policy for journalists or any other accounts.” In a tweet earlier in the evening, Musk said of the bans: “They posted my exact real-time location, basically assassination coordinates, in (obvious) direct violation of Twitter terms of service.” The ElonJet account in the links he objected to automatically shares publicly available information on the flight path for Musk’s private jet. (It does not list the passenger manifest.)  Accounts like ElonJet — and the similarly suspended CelebJet and RUOligarchJets — are frequently used by climate activists to highlight the egregious effect private jets have on the environment. Musk, Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Taylor Swift have all come under fire this year for using jets when alternative means of transportation could be used with less deleterious effects on the environment. Musk has long had issue with the location of his private jet being shared in real time. At one point, he went so far as to offer thousands of dollars to the manager of the @ElonJet account to take it offline. On Wednesday, he implied in a tweet that the account had been used by a “crazy stalker” to find and climb on the hood of a car carrying one of his children. (It is unclear how the location of the jet led to a car.) He then tweeted a video of the alleged stalker and his license plate with the caption: “Anyone recognize this person or car?” That same day, Twitter suspended the @ElonJet account, the account belonging to its owner Jack Sweeney, and other accounts he managed that were tracking the locations of private jets using publicly accessible data. Today, the enforcement was ratcheted up to include journalists tweeting about the situation. Musk also ran a poll asking when he should unsuspend the journalists who tweeted about “ElonJet.” “Now” won with 43 percent of the vote. (“Longer” was runner-up with 38.1 percent.) In response, Musk said he’d redo the poll because the original had too many options. He then posted a second poll, which will run for 24 hours. As of this writing, “now” is still winning. Musk’s polls supposedly have weight in his moderation decisions. Previously, he has said he unbanned Trump as well as other previously suspended accounts based on poll results.  It also appears that Twitter is not letting people post links to some instances of the competing decentralized social network Mastodon. Specifically, our tests showed an error saying “we can’t complete this request because this link has been identified by Twitter or our partners as being potentially harmful” when trying to tweet links to Mastodon.social, Mastodon.lol, Mastodon.xyz, Mastodon.au, Mastodon.ie, Mastodon.scot, Mastodonapp.uk, Mastodon.world, and others. Earlier today, Mastodon’s Twitter account was suspended after it tweeted a link to the ElonJet Mastodon account. “I have not received any communications from Twitter whatsoever, other than a notice at the top of my feed that I am permanently banned and in read-only mode,” said Rupar, one of the reporters who was suspended, in an email to The Verge. “I have no idea what could have prompted this.” In a story on his Substack, he said that yesterday he posted a tweet “noting that the ElonJet account that was suspended from Twitter was still active on Facebook, with a link to the Facebook page.” A statement from The New York Times spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander echoes the sentiment, saying that “neither The Times nor Ryan have received any explanation about why this occurred. We hope that all of the journalists’ accounts are reinstated and that Twitter provides a satisfying explanation for this action.” CNN posted a statement calling O’Sullivan’s suspension “concerning but not surprising” and said that it will “reevaluate” its relationship with Twitter based on the explanation it gets for the ban. The suspensions don’t appear to be entirely limited to journalists. Commentator Keith Olbermann has been suspended, as has the Twitter account for ADS-B Exchange, which describes itself as “the world’s largest source of open unblocked unfiltered flight data for enthusiasts.” The account recently quote-retweeted someone trying to track Musk’s jet, according to a WayBack Machine archive. Musk has previously promised to make Twitter a hub for “free speech” and held up the @ElonJet account as the type of thing he would permit on the platform, even though it could cause him harm. “My commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane, even though that is a direct personal safety risk,” he tweeted on November 6th. Update December 15th, 9:40PM ET: Added information that Twitter appears to be blocking links to certain Mastodon instances. Update December 15th, 9:49PM ET: Added statement from CNN and additional examples of blocked Mastodon links. Update December 15, 10:48PM ET: Added Musk’s tweet calling the link of public information sourced by the ElonJet account “assassination coordinates.” Update December 16th, 12:33AM ET: Added context about Musk joining a Twitter Space to discuss the suspensions and running a poll asking when he should unsuspend the journalists. Correction December 16th, 12:14PM ET: A previous version of this article misspelled Micah Lee’s name.

Musk has always been unpredictable and freewheeling with his public persona, but with Twitter, his actions have directly affected the business, ...","Elon Musk was speechless. The Twitter CEO was on a live audio chat Tuesday night with software engineers when one user started quizzing him about the internal workings of the company’s systems. Musk, who hours earlier said he would keep control of Twitter’s software systems even though he plans to relinquish the CEO role, said the company’s code needed a complete rewrite. One of the participants asked what he meant — pushing for him to explain it from top to bottom. “Amazing, wow,” Musk said after hesitations and pauses. “You’re a jackass. … What a moron.” The incident highlights the new reality facing Musk, who also runs Tesla and SpaceX: a crisis of confidence in his once-unquestioned brilliance. That crisis accelerated as Tesla stock prices plunged nearly 20 percent this week to $123 per share on Friday, largely due to concerns about Musk. Also this week, roughly 58 percent of 17 million Twitter accounts that responded to an unscientific poll from Musk said he should step down as Twitter CEO, after helping create, then reverse new policies that proved controversial last weekend. “Historically he’s been a pendulum between genius and reckless,” said Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures. “He’s on reckless right now. He’s way over recklessness.” Munster added, “It leaves people to view him … as slightly less of a genius.” The key moments that define Musk’s leadership of Twitter Musk has built his reputation on having a Midas touch with the companies he runs — something many investors and experts thought he would bring to Twitter when he purchased it for $44 billion in October, paying nearly twice as much as it was worth by some analyst estimates. He is known for sleeping on the factory floor at Tesla, demanding long hours and quick turnarounds from his workers. He is seen as an engineering genius, propelling promises of cars that can drive themselves and rockets that can take humans to Mars. But that image is unraveling. Some Twitter employees who worked with Musk are doubtful his management style will allow him to turn the company around. And some investors in Tesla, by far the biggest source of his wealth, have begun to see him as a liability. Musk’s distraction has prompted questions about leadership of SpaceX as well, though it is much less reliant on his active involvement. Meanwhile, Neuralink and Boring Co., two companies he founded, continue to lag on promises. Musk’s net worth — largely fueled by his stake in Tesla, which has fallen by more than half this year — has plunged this year from roughly $270 billion to below $140 billion on Friday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That fall has relieved him of the title of the world’s richest man and called into question his ability to keep up with his billions of dollars in loans. Musk is repeatedly described as a man obsessed with Twitter in all the wrong ways, who is failing both at protecting his new investment and his previous ones, according to interviews with a half-dozen former Twitter employees and people in Musk’s orbit, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution or because they were not authorized to speak publicly about company matters. Musk this week said Twitter is in a financial hole and facing a cash crunch — even as it slashed more than half of the workforce and closed offices. “We have an emergency fire drill on our hands,” Musk said on Twitter Spaces. “Aspirationally, I’m not naturally capricious.” From Jared Kushner to Salt Bae: Here’s who Elon Musk was spotted with at the World Cup Musk has always been unpredictable and freewheeling with his public persona, but with Twitter, his actions have directly affected the business, turning off some of the company’s users and pushing away advertisers, said Jo-Ellen Pozner, a management professor at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business. “It really feels destabilizing for the whole Twitter community,” she said, adding that the reputation of a CEO does affect businesses and their stock prices — and could even prompt consumers to choose another vehicle. Musk and Twitter — which has disbanded most of its public relations team — did not respond to requests for comment. Musk, who is South African and migrated to North America as a teenager, first forged his image as a tech wizard by founding the company that became PayPal. He funneled much of his around $165 million in gains from the sale of PayPal into two ventures: Tesla and SpaceX. SpaceX went on to become the most successful private spaceflight company in history, pioneering reusable rockets and launching astronauts to the International Space Station. Tesla, meanwhile, brought electric vehicles to the mainstream with sleek, fast and competitively priced sedans and SUVs that shattered the frumpy image of eco-conscious cars. His closest allies have held out faith even as he has missed major deadlines for selling new vehicle models and rolling out self-driving technology. Musk has been focused almost solely on Twitter since he bought it, planning to reinvent the company as an engineering-driven operation. He immediately ousted Twitter’s previous executives and embarked on a campaign of harsh layoffs that cut the company in half. Many of Musk’s supporters, who had followed his rise at Tesla, gave him the benefit of the doubt that he had a plan to transform Twitter. But he immediately spooked advertisers by engaging in a baseless accusation and dialed back Twitter’s content moderation, prompting calls from civil rights groups for advertisers to suspend their marketing on the site. And he had to pull back his first major product launch — Twitter Blue Verified — after a day, when a swarm of impersonators wreaked havoc. A fake tweet sparked panic at Eli Lilly and may have cost Twitter millions Musk appears to be struggling to grasp Twitter’s business, the people said, and he demands a stance from his employees that stifles discussion of problems. “He doesn’t see from the zoom-out view at all,” one of the people close to Musk and his team said, describing him as “uncovering and solving and programming all night.” He has been holed up in a 10th-floor conference area with a staging room for visitors — where they often remain for more than an hour before being called in. They are instructed not to speak until Musk does. And when they do finally meet with him, he’s sometimes watching YouTube videos. Many staffers have quickly learned they can’t rely on the erratic and unpredictable Musk, even as he makes assurances about the various facets of the company they have raised as concerns. The driving team behind Project Eraser — which carries out functions such as deleting the user data of those who ask, part of compliance with federal requirements — has been gutted. Musk has brought in a new roster of leaders, many who are loyalists. When one executive met with Musk and voiced concerns about the Federal Trade Commission’s consent decree, Musk assured that person there was nothing to worry about. He said Tesla had plenty of experience on privacy matters, and pointed to his deep knowledge and awareness of the constraints Twitter was under. Minutes after the meeting concluded, a subordinate of Musk emailed: Would the executive be willing to send over a copy of the consent decree they had just discussed? Instead of focusing on plans to make the site a competitor to YouTube with video and rolling out other new features that will earn revenue, he instead got sucked into the culture wars, the people said. That took the form of the Twitter Files, an examination by some journalists of many of the company’s actions before Musk’s arrival, such as the blocking of a New York Post story that dug into the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop and the ban on former president Donald Trump. Musk chose Bari Weiss, a former New York Times columnist, as one of the writers invited inside the company to go through documents. “Please give Bari full access to everything at Twitter,” Musk wrote to a subordinate in a Signal message viewed by The Washington Post. “No limits at all.” Journalists who won’t delete tweets remain locked out of Twitter That was concerning to many inside Twitter — particularly those familiar with the 2011 FTC settlement after hacks of high-profile accounts, including that of then-President Barack Obama. Staffers responsible for her onboarding pushed back and refused to grant Weiss the full access Musk had requested, believing it would violate the settlement. One former employee described that step as “super unprecedented” and “highly inappropriate,” saying Twitter would never have granted that level of access to an outside party who might suddenly be able to read direct messages, for example. The pushback, however, was not taken as seriously at senior levels. Days later, Musk announced deputy general counsel Jim Baker had been “exited” from the company, as the CEO cited what he called his “possible role in suppression of information important to the public dialogue.” Former employees said it would have been normal for an attorney to review documents for release. That same day, Alan Rosa, Twitter’s chief information security officer in charge of access matters, was fired from the company as well. Employees that week found Weiss’s name searchable in Slack, the company’s internal messaging service. But her access was overseen by a chaperone, new Twitter Trust and Safety chief Ella Irwin. Irwin’s name appeared in a watermark on the Twitter Files. When Twitter suspended more than half a dozen journalists last week over alleged violations of its rules on doxing — the sharing of private information — the suspensions were labeled in internal systems “direction of Ella.” Wachtell & Twitter board deliberately hid this evidence from the court. Stay tuned, more to come … pic.twitter.com/CifaNvtRtt Musk had also publicized an old message from his previous Trust and Safety head and taken  aim at Twitter executives, unleashing a swarm of criticism on employees — sometimes while they were still working for the company. “These guys did amazing damage,” one former employee said of Musk’s circle at Twitter, which included employees of his other companies and friends who lacked expertise on Twitter. “They are basically bullying their way to getting ‘super god’ access to these things. All they’re doing is they’re witch hunting for Elon, so they can find people talking [about him] so they can fire them.” Musk is running the newly private company largely on his instincts — mirroring the workflows of his other major technology company: Tesla. The electric car company, the world’s most valuable automaker, has eschewed market research in its dominance of the electric vehicle space, seeding the automotive industry with a raw and authentic expressions of Musk’s id. Tesla’s stainless steel Cybertruck pickup, which shocked automotive analysts with its angular sci-fi looks, has served as a key example of that ethos. At Tesla, employees often find out about deadlines and major product changes through tweeted edicts. But they have also grown used to the CEO’s shoot-from-the-hip attitude, his reliance on his gut instincts rather than the research and development arms typical of multibillion-dollar corporations. But Tesla’s stock price has plummeted — which Musk frequently attributes to economic trends. “As bank savings account interest rates, which are guaranteed, start to approach stock market returns, which are *not* guaranteed, people will increasingly move their money out of stocks into cash, thus causing stocks to drop,” he said in a tweet Tuesday. But analysts have pointed to problems more specific to Tesla and concern with Musk’s time at Twitter, suggesting in essence that the sheen has worn off a company whose value was not rooted in its fundamentals. “I felt for a while he was given a pass,” said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at the website iSeeCars. “‘Oh, it’s Elon. He’s Midas: If he’s touching it, it’s going to be successful.’ Now a certain number of people have stopped giving him a pass on things that probably should have been looked at a little more critically or acknowledged as potential downside.” The crisis in confidence in his leadership accelerated when Musk began making changes to Twitter to address his personal problems and concerns. Last week, he reneged on a previous commitment to allow  an account on Twitter that published the location of his private jet, which he held up as an example of his free speech principles. After abruptly suspending @ElonJet, Twitter suspended journalists who tweeted about it, drawing ire from both sides of the political spectrum. He launched a poll, which directed Musk to allow them back on the site. “The people have spoken,” he tweeted that Friday. Elon Musk’s private jet is tracked with public data. Is it doxing? Musk jetted around the globe to Qatar for the World Cup final on Sunday, where he was spotted alongside former president Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Qatari leaders. That day, Twitter announced a new policy: It was banning the promotion of outside social media sites on its platform, including Facebook, Instagram and Trump-backed Truth Social. Users would no longer be able to promote outside links to those sites and others, including Mastodon, Tribel, Post and Nostr. Twitter said cross-posting of content would be allowed, but it would no longer permit “free promotion.” The criticism was swift, and even loyalists expressed concern. Musk apologized. “Going forward, there will be a vote for major policy changes,” he tweeted. “My apologies. Won’t happen again.” Then Musk launched a new poll. “Should I step down as head of Twitter?” he wrote in a tweet. “I will abide by the results of this poll.” By Monday morning, the result was clear that Musk should step down. He went silent on the platform for much of the day — one of his longer stretches as a prolific tweeter to his more than 120 million followers. He responded to a few tweets later in the day calling the results into question. On Tuesday, he said he would resign — with caveats. “I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!” he wrote in a tweet. “After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.” Gerrit De Vynck and Cat Zakrzewski contributed to this report."

The social media platform's new owner, Elon Musk, has been trying to prove through giving selected journalists access to some of the ...","The social media platform’s new owner, Elon Musk, has been trying to prove through giving selected journalists access to some of the company’s internal communications dubbed “The Twitter Files” that officials from the previous leadership team allegedly suppressed right-wing voices. This week, Musk disbanded a key advisory group, the Trust and Safety Council, made up of dozens of independent civil, human rights and other organizations. The company formed the council in 2016 to address hate speech, harassment, child exploitation, suicide, self-harm and other problems on the platform. What do the developments mean for what shows up in your feed every day? For one, the moves show that Musk is prioritizing improving Twitter’s perception on the US political right. He’s not promising unfettered free speech as much as a shift in what messages get amplified or hidden. Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in late October and since then has partnered with a group of handpicked journalists including former Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi and opinion columnist Bari Weiss. Earlier this month, they began publishing – in the form of a series of tweets – about actions that Twitter previously took against accounts thought to have violated its content rules. They’ve included screenshots of emails and messaging board comments reflecting internal conversations within Twitter about those decisions. Weiss wrote on December 8 that the “authors have broad and expanding access to Twitter’s files. The only condition we agreed to was that the material would first be published on Twitter.” Weiss published the fifth and most recent installment Monday about the conversations leading up to Twitter’s Jan. 8, 2021 decision to permanently suspend then-President Donald Trump’s account “due to the risk of further incitement of violence” following the deadly US Capitol insurrection two days earlier. The internal communications show at least one unnamed staffer doubting that one of the tweets was an incitement of violence; it also reveals executives’ reaction to an advocacy campaign from some employees pushing for tougher action on Trump. Musk’s Twitter Files reveal some of the internal decision-making process affecting mostly right-wing Twitter accounts that the company decided broke its rules against hateful conduct, as well as those that violated the platform’s rules against spreading harmful misinformation about Covid-19. But the reports are largely based on anecdotes about a handful of high-profile accounts and the tweets don’t reveal numbers about the scale of suspensions and which views were more likely to be affected. The journalists appear to have unfettered access to the company’s Slack messaging board – visible to all employees – but have relied on Twitter executives to deliver other documents. In 2018, after then-CEO Jack Dorsey said Twitter would focus on the “health” of conversations on the platform, the company outlined a new approach intended to reduce the impact of disruptive users, or trolls, by reading “behavioral signals” that tend to indicate when users are more interested in blowing up conversations than in contributing. Twitter has long said it used a technique described internally as “visibility filtering” to reduce the reach of some accounts that might violate its rules but don’t rise to the level of being suspended. But it rejected allegations it was secretly “shadowbanning” conservative viewpoints.Screenshots showing an employee’s view of prominent user accounts disclosed through the Twitter Files show how that filtering works in practice. It’s also led Musk to call for changes to make that more transparent. “Twitter is working on a software update that will show your true account status, so you know clearly if you’ve been shadowbanned, the reason why and how to appeal,” he tweeted. Musk laid off about half of Twitter’s staff after he bought the platform and later eliminated an unknown number of contract workers who had focused on content moderation. Some workers who were kept on soon quit, including Yoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety.The departure of so many employees raised questions about how the platform could enforce its policies against harmful misinformation, hate speech and threats of violence, both within the US and across the globe. Automated tools can help detect spam and some suspicious accounts, but others take more careful human review. It’s likely the reductions will force Twitter to concentrate content moderation efforts on regions with stronger regulations governing social media platforms like Europe, where tech companies could face big fines under the new Digital Services Act if they don’t make an effort to combat misinformation and hate speech, according to Bhaskar Chakravorti, dean of global business at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.“The staff has been decimated,” Chakravorti said. “The few content moderators left are going to be focused on Europe, because Europe is the squeakiest wheel.” Since Musk bought Twitter a number of researchers and advocacy groups have pointed to an increase in posts containing racial epithets or attacks on Jewish people, gays, lesbians and transgender people. In many cases, the posts were written by users who said they were trying to test Twitter’s new boundaries.According to Musk, Twitter acted quickly to reduce the overall visibility of the posts, and that overall engagement with hate speech is down since he purchased the company, a finding disputed by researchers. The most obvious sign of change at Twitter are the formerly banned users whose accounts have been reinstated, a list that includes Trump, satire site The Babylon Bee, the comedian Kathy Griffin, Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson and, before he was kicked off again, Ye. Twitter has also reinstated accounts of neo-Nazis white supremacists including Andrew Anglin, the creator of the white supremacist website Daily Stormer — along with QAnon supporters whom Twitter’s old guard had been removing in masses to prevent hate and misinformation from spreading on the platform. In addition, some high-profile tweeters like Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene who were previously banned for spreading misinformation about Covid-19 have resumed posting misleading claims about vaccine safety and sham cures. Musk, who has spread false claims about Covid-19 himself, returned to the topic this with a tweet this week that mocked transgender pronouns while calling for criminal charges against Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert and one of the leaders of the country’s COVID response. Calling himself a “free-speech absolutist,” Musk has said he wants to allow all content that’s legally permissible on Twitter but also that he wants to downgrade negative and hateful posts. Instead of removing toxic content, Musk’s call for “freedom of speech, not freedom of reach” suggests Twitter may leave such content up without recommending it or amplifying it to other users. But after cutting out most of Twitter’s policy-making executives and outside advisers, Musk often appears to be the arbiter of what crosses the line. Last month, Musk himself announced that he was booting Ye after the rapper formerly known as Kanye West posted an image of a swastika merged with a Star of David, a post that was not illegal but deeply offensive. The move led to questions about what rules govern what can and can’t be posted on the platform. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News          Elon Musk’s wealth destruction has become historic.
   
      The CEO of Tesla
            
                (TSLA), SpaceX and Twitter is worth $137 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, good enough for second place on the list of the world’s richest behind LVMH
            
                (LVMHF) Chairman Bernard Arnault. But at its peak in November 2021, Musk’s net worth was $340 billion. 
   
      That makes Musk the first person ever to lose $200 billion in wealth, Bloomberg reported last week.
   
      The bulk of Musk’s wealth is tied up in Tesla
            
                (TSLA), whose stock plunged 65% in 2022. Demand for Tesla
            
                (TSLA)s weakened as competition in electric vehicles from established automakers surged last year. The company missed its growth targets and scaled back production in China. Its fourth-quarter deliveries, announced Monday, missed Wall Street’s estimates.
   
      Evidence of car buyers’ sinking interest in Teslas became apparent last month after the company announced a rare sale in a bid to clear out inventory. Tesla offered two rebates for buyers taking delivery of a vehicle before the end of the year, initially offering a $3,750 discount then doubling the rebate to $7,500 with two weeks left in 2022.
   
      Investors were rattled by the rebates, sending the stock plunging 37% in December. 
   
      Critics have long questioned whether Tesla was ever worth the trillion-dollar valuation it had at the start of 2022.  At its peak, Tesla was worth more than the 12 largest automakers on the planet combined, despite having a fraction of their sales. Tesla ended the year worth $386 billion — still much larger than its automaker rivals but far smaller than the tech titans — Apple

                (AMZN) — with which it was being compared a year ago.
   
      Musk’s $44 billion purchase of Twitter hasn’t helped Tesla’s stock or Musk’s personal wealth, either. Musk, Tesla’s largest shareholder, has sold $23 billion worth of Tesla shares since his interest in Twitter became public in April.
   
      His constant tweeting and increasingly erratic behavior, particularly after taking over as CEO at Twitter, has angered Tesla investors who want Musk to pay more attention to his significantly larger and more valuable company. Musk has defended himself against critics, saying he hasn’t missed a major Tesla meeting since taking on responsibility for Twitter. 
   
      Tesla’s stock may rebound, and Musk could once again become the world’s richest person. But Musk’s reputation as a genius took some serious damage in 2022 — almost as much damage as his personal wealth.

On November 16, Musk emailed his remaining 2,900 employees an ultimatum. He was building Twitter 2.0, he said, and workers would need to be “ ...","By  Zoe Schiffer,  Casey Newton, and  Alex Heath Illustrations by Jason Allen Lee for The Verge This article is a collaboration between New York Magazine and The Verge. It was reported by Zoe Schiffer and Casey Newton, who write Platformer, and Alex Heath, who writes Command Line. In April 2022, Elon Musk acquired a 9.2 ­percent stake in Twitter, making him the company’s largest shareholder, and was offered a seat on the board. Luke Simon, a senior engineering director at Twitter, was ecstatic. “Elon Musk is a brilliant engineer and scientist, and he has a track record of having a Midas touch, when it comes to growing the companies he’s helped lead,” he wrote in Slack. Twitter had been defined by the catatonic leadership of Jack Dorsey, a co-founder who simultaneously served as CEO of the payments business Block (formerly Square). Dorsey, who was known for going on long meditation retreats, fasting 22 hours a day, and walking five miles to the office, acted as an absentee landlord, leaving Twitter’s strategy and daily operations to a handful of trusted deputies. When he spoke about Twitter, it was often as if someone else were running the company. To Simon and those like him, it was hard to see Twitter as anything other than wasted potential.  In its early days, when Twitter was at its most Twittery, circa 2012, executives called the company “the free-speech wing of the free-speech party.” That was the era when the platform was credited for amplifying the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Arab Spring, when it seemed like ­giving everyone a microphone might ­actually bring down dictatorships and right the wrongs of neoliberal capitalism. That moment, which coincided with the rise of Facebook and YouTube, inspired ­utopian visions of how social networks could ­promote democracy and human rights around the world. Twitter rode this momentum to become one of the most important companies in tech: an all-consuming obsession for those working or merely interested in politics, sports, and journalism around the world. Frequently, the platform set the news agenda and transformed nobodies into Main Characters. What it lacked in profits it more than made up for in influence. Rumors were swirling that Musk planned to cut 75 percent of the company. People were audibly sobbing in the bathrooms. No one understood how to weaponize that influence better than Donald Trump, who in 2016 propelled himself into the White House in part by harnessing hate and vitriol via his @realDonaldTrump feed. A new consensus that the site was a sewer made it worth a lot less money. ­Disney CEO Bob Iger pulled out of a bid to acquire Twitter, saying the “nastiness” on the platform was extraordinary. After the election and the blown deal, Twitter overhauled its ­content-moderation policies, staffed up its trust and safety team, and committed itself to ­fostering “healthy conversations.” Never again would it let itself be used by a tyrant to sow discord and increase polarization. Two days after the January 6 insurrection, the platform banned Trump; the company had seen the toll of unfettered speech and decided it wasn’t worth it. This was the Twitter that irked Elon Musk so much that he became convinced he had to buy it. In his view, by 2022 the company had been corrupted — beholden to the whims of governments and the ­liberal media elite. It shadow-banned ­conservatives, suppressed legitimate discourse about covid, and selectively kicked elected officials off the platform. Who better to restore Twitter to its former glory than its wealthiest poster?  Like Trump, Musk knew how to use Twitter to make himself the center of the conversation. His incessant, irreverent tweeting violated every norm of corporate America, endearing his fans, pissing off his haters, and making him the second-most-followed active account on the site. “At least 50% of my tweets were made on a porcelain throne,” he tweeted one evening in late 2021. “It gives me solace.” Musk offered to buy the company for the absurdly inflated price of $44 billion. The move thrilled employees like Simon who chafed at Twitter’s laid-back atmosphere and reputation for shipping new features at a glacial pace. Simon, who owned a ­portrait of himself dressed as a 19th-century French general, told his team, which managed advertising services, that he wanted to build an “impact-focused, egalitarian and empirical culture, where any team member, with a strong data-driven justification, gets the metaphorical center stage.” Other employees noted the darker motifs of Musk’s career — the disregard he brought to labor relations, the many lawsuits alleging sexual harassment and racial discrimination at his companies — and found his interest in Twitter ominous. On Slack, a product manager responded to Simon’s enthusiasm for Musk with skepticism: “I take your point, but as a childhood Greek mythology nerd, I feel it is important to point out that story behind the idea of the Midas touch is not a positive one. It’s a cautionary tale about what is lost when you only focus on wealth.” The comment would prove to be ­prophetic. According to more than two dozen current and former Twitter staffers, since buying the company in October 2022, Musk has shown a remarkable lack of interest in the people and processes that make his new toy tick. He has purged thousands of employees, implemented ill-advised policies, and angered even some of his most loyal supporters. Those who remain at the company mostly fall into two camps: people trapped by the need for health care and visas or cold-eyed mercenaries hoping to ascend through a power vacuum. Today, Musk has become notorious for the speech he suppresses, rather than the speech he allows, from ­suspending ­journalists for tweeting links to his jet tracker to briefly restricting users from linking to their accounts on Instagram and Mastodon. In three months, Musk has also largely destroyed the equity value of Twitter and much of his personal wealth. He has ­indicated that the company could declare bankruptcy, and the distraction of running it has caused Tesla stock to ­crater, costing him $200 billion. If “free speech” was his mandate for ­Twitter the platform, it has been the opposite for Twitter the workplace. Dissenting opinion or criticism has led to swift dismissals. Musk replaced Twitter’s old culture with one of his own, but it’s unclear, with so few workers and plummeting revenues, if this new version will survive. As one employee said in December, “Place is done for.” On October 26, an engineer and mother of two — let’s call her Alicia — sat in a glass conference room in San Francisco trying to explain the details of Twitter’s tech stack to Elon Musk. He was supposed to officially buy the company in two days, and Alicia and a small group of trusted colleagues were tasked with outlining how its core infrastructure worked. But Musk, who was sitting two seats away from Alicia with his elbows propped on the table, looked sleepy. When he did talk, it was to ask questions about cost. How much does Twitter spend on data centers? Why was everything so expensive? Alicia was already tired of Musk’s antics. For months, he had gone back and forth about buying the company where she had worked for more than a decade. He’d tried to back out of the deal, but Twitter sued, and the chief judge of Delaware’s Chancery Court said a trial would move forward if the acquisition wasn’t complete by October 28. Facing what many legal observers called an easy case for Twitter, Musk caved. So here they were, trying to show Musk what he was about to buy, and all he wanted to talk about was money.  Fine, she thought. If Musk wants to know about money, I’ll tell him. She launched into a technical explanation of the ­company’s data-center efficiency, curious to see if he would follow along. Instead, he interrupted. “I was writing C programs in the ’90s,” he said dismissively. “I understand how ­computers work.” Alicia knew Twitter had problems; when prospective employees asked her why she’d stayed there so long, she would tell them, honestly, that the company was incredibly inefficient. It took a long time to get buy-in on projects, and communication across teams was generally poor. But it operated with a “benevolent anarchy” through which anyone could influence the direction of the product. “You didn’t need someone in a position of power to explicitly grant you permission,” Alicia says. “It was very much a bottom-up organization.” Unlike some of her colleagues, Alicia wasn’t reflexively anti-Musk. She respected what he had done at his companies and felt hopeful that, as someone who thought of himself as an engineer, he would support her highly technical work. But Musk had a different interest that day. Twitter, he said, should immediately get into video. “Please be ready to show your recent code (within last 30-60 preferably) on your computer. If you have already printed, please shred in the bins on SF-Tenth. Thank you!” “We really should be able to do longform video and attract the best content creators by giving them a better cut than YouTube,” he said, according to Alicia’s recollection. The infrastructure engineers in the room agreed that adding support for longform video was technically possible, but their job was building stuff — not strategy or marketing. It seemed as though Musk didn’t understand the basic organizational structure of a social-media company; it was as if a rich guy had bought a restaurant and started telling the cooks he wanted to add a new dining room. Might he want to speak with the media product team instead?  Just then, David Sacks, a venture capitalist and friend of Musk’s who had advised him on the acquisition, walked into the room. A fellow native of South Africa, Sacks had worked with Musk at PayPal and later led the enterprise social-networking company Yammer to a $1.2 billion sale to Microsoft. “David, this meeting is too technical for you,” Musk said, waving his hand to ­dismiss Sacks. Wordlessly, Sacks turned and walked out, leaving the engineers — who had gotten ­little engagement from Musk on anything technical — slack-jawed. His imperiousness in the middle of a session he appeared to be botching was something to behold. (Musk did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) The next day, Alicia and her colleagues gathered in the cafeteria of Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters for a long-planned Halloween party. The room was decorated with miniature pumpkins and fake spider­webs. Employees tried to get in the holiday spirit, but rumors were swirling that Musk planned to cut 75 percent of the company. People were audibly sobbing in the bathrooms. One company leader recalled the surreal moment of crying about the end of Twitter as they knew it, only to look up and see a person in a Jack Sparrow costume amble by. Outside on the balcony, one entertainer blew bubbles for staffers’ children. Another figure, dressed as a scarecrow, seemed to have a handler ­following him. There were whispers: Could it be Musk himself in costume? It turned out to be a hired performer. As Alicia walked out of the office that evening, she passed Twitter’s head of ­product, Jay Sullivan, who was standing alone, looking solemn. “It’s done,” he said. The deal had closed during the party.  It took only a few hours before news broke that Twitter’s executive team had walked the plank. Parag Agrawal, the CEO, was out, along with Vijaya Gadde, the head of policy, and Ned Segal, the chief finance officer. They had known what was ­coming and stayed away from the office. Sean Edgett, the general counsel, was also fired; he had been present for the handover and was unceremoniously escorted out of the building during the Halloween party.  The days surrounding the acquisition passed in a blur of ominous, unlikely scenes. Musk posing as the world’s richest prop comic, announcing his takeover by lugging a kitchen sink into the office: “Entering ­Twitter HQ—let that sink in!” (181.2K retweets, 43.6K quote tweets, 1.3M likes.) A fleet of Teslas in the parking lot. Musk’s intimidating security detail standing outside his glass conference room as if guarding the leader of a developing nation. Musk’s 2-year-old son, X Æ A-Xii, toddling around the second floor, occasionally crying.  Employees braced for layoffs, but no word came from Musk. People hunted for information on their unofficial Slacks, Discords, and Signal chats while glued to Musk’s Twitter feed for news like everyone else. “Hey all don’t forget to complete your q3 goals!” one employee wrote darkly on Slack. “Writes, ‘stay employed,’ ” responded a colleague.  Even Twitter executives were clueless. Chief marketing officer Leslie Berland sent an email encouraging employees to say hi to Musk if they saw him in the office and promised an all-hands meeting would happen that Friday. An invitation for a company­wide assembly appeared on people’s calendars, then disappeared. When employees followed up on Slack, the head of internal communications cryptically said she would “send out a communication when there are further details.”  Musk brought in a cadre of close ­advisers, including Sacks and his fellow venture capitalist and podcast co-host Jason ­Calacanis; Musk’s celebrity lawyer, Alex Spiro; Steve Davis, the head of his ­tunneling start-up, the Boring Company; and Sriram ­Krishnan, who had previously been a consumer-­product director at Twitter. To employees, this crew would be known by only one name: the Goons. On Musk’s first full day in charge, October 28, the executive assistants sent Twitter engineers a Slack message at the behest of the Goons: The boss wanted to see their code. Employees were instructed to “print out 50 pages of code you’ve done in the last 30 days” and get ready to show it to Musk in person. Panicked engineers started ­hunting around the office for printers. Many of the devices weren’t functional, having sat unused for two years during the pandemic. Eventually, a group of executive assistants offered to print some engineers’ code for them if they would send the file as a PDF. Within a couple of hours, the Goons’ assistants sent out a new missive to the team: “update: Stop printing,” it read. “Please be ready to show your recent code (within last 30-60 preferably) on your computer. If you have already printed, please shred in the bins on SF-Tenth. Thank you!” Alicia was scheduled to meet with Musk around 11 a.m. She felt bad about the anxiety coursing through the office, even if she was sanguine about the process. As a back-end engineer, she was used to being woken up in the middle of the night because something on the platform was breaking — a ­crisis that could impact millions of Twitter users. It took more than a code review to faze her.  She had printed out a few lines of Python rather than her actual code repository. (“Python is more at Musk’s level,” she says.) The mandate had felt like a stunt, and she’d doubted he would really engage: “I’m not gonna explain the project I’ve spent ten years working on in a fraction of an hour competing with ten other people — I’m just not.”  She never had to. The meeting was pushed back, then canceled. “We didn’t actually get to show our code to Elon,” she says, laughing. “Which is a shame. I was very much looking forward to it.” The botched code review did little to deter the Goons, who still needed to figure out which of Twitter’s 7,500 employees were needed to keep the site running — and who could be jettisoned. At ten that same night, they told managers they should “stack rank” their teams, a common but cold method of evaluation that forces managers to designate their lowest performers. Amir Shevat, who managed Twitter’s developer platform and had led large teams at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, was perplexed. Every company did stack ­ranking differently. Should they sort ­workers by seniority? Impact? Revenue generated? No one had an answer. “They said, ‘We don’t know. Elon wants a stack rank,’ ” Shevat says.  The project succeeded in generating large lists of names, but because different managers had ranked employees ­according to their own methods, the results were incoherent. “If I were to get that list, I would probably throw it in the garbage because it’s completely useless,” Shevat says. In the meantime, managers and other senior employees began receiving calls late at night from the Goons. “Who are the best people on your team?” they would ask. “Who’s critical? Who’s technical?” The questions reflected Musk’s certainty that Twitter could be run with a relatively small number of top ­engineers — and almost no one else. Meanwhile, ­managers were fielding worried questions from ­workers, but the only one that mattered — “Will I still have a job here?” — no one could answer. The New York Times reported that one engineering manager puked in a trash can after being told to cut ­hundreds of workers. Even Shevat didn’t know if his position was safe. Soon another new directive came from above: Large meetings were banned. Musk and the Goons were wary of sabotage from soon-to-be-fired workers and didn’t want to risk any of them getting a ­warning before they were cut. The ­message was “group meetings are no longer a thing,” Shevat recalls. “And if you do that, you risk getting fired.” “When your team is pushing round the clock to make deadlines sometimes you #SleepWhereYouWork,” she said.  Shevat had been scheduled to meet with Sacks at 1 p.m. to walk him through the developer platform’s product road map. (Musk was technically Shevat’s direct manager, but the two never met one-on-one.) Every hour, an assistant messaged Shevat to say the meeting was delayed. When it finally began, around 8 p.m., ­Shevat explained what his team did — they ran the services that allowed outside developers to create apps that connected to Twitter, a feature of any major platform. It would be a crucial component if Musk pursued his publicly stated aspiration to make Twitter a “super-app” like WeChat, which has a thriving economy of mini-apps made by outside engineers. Shevat thought Sacks seemed bored — he spent most of the meeting checking his phone. “He didn’t want to understand anything,” Shevat says. It made him want to cry, especially since he had actually been eager to work with Musk. “I would have worked really hard for him,” he says. Similar meetings were taking place across the company. Musk had imported dozens of engineers from his other ­organizations — including Tesla, ­Neuralink, and the Boring Company — to help run Twitter and cull its staff. Two of his cousins, Andrew and James Musk, were added to the employee directory. Twitter employees were soon either ­sitting around waiting to be fired or placed on Musk projects, pulling all-nighters at the office and trying to meet arbitrary deadlines, even as product plans changed by the day (and were often announced on Musk’s Twitter feed). If they didn’t meet their deadlines, they were told, they’d be fired — a fate that, to some, looked ­increasingly desirable. The following week, on November 3, employees received an unsigned email from “Twitter” relaying that the time for layoffs had started. By 9 a.m. the following day, everyone would receive a note telling them whether they still had a job. “From ‘Twitter’ looool what fucking cowards,” a former employee said by text. “Your people are Twitter you shits.”  That night, hundreds of employees gathered in a Slack channel called #social-watercooler, which had become the company’s de facto town square since Musk took over. They posted salute emoji and blue hearts — solidarity for those who were being cut and for those who deeply wanted to be shown the door but were somehow asked to stay. One person posted a meme of Thanos from Avengers: Infinity War, the super­villain who exterminates half the ­living beings in the universe with a snap. By morning, 50 percent of the workforce had lost their jobs, well over 3,000 people. “The alternation between relief about being done, sadness about [waves at gaps and fires where there was cool people / hope], anxiety that Musk might fuck with severance, and exhaustion at thought of interviewing is a bit much,” wrote the same former employee, “but veering towards relief.” The worker left a message for Twitter leadership in a main Slack channel before their access was cut: “news articles aren’t comms. Tweets from an account associated with half-baked rants, copy pasted memes, and the occasional misinfo aren’t comms. Secondhand internal sharing and employee sleuthing aren’t comms … I also hope failure of this past week hangs heavy on you to remind you to do better.” To avoid violating federal labor law, Musk said employees would be paid for the next two months, though they would lose access to Twitter’s systems immediately. But even this played out haphazardly; some workers lost access on schedule, while others lingered in Twitter’s critical systems for months.  The layoffs wiped out Shevat and his entire team. Alicia kept her position, as she’d expected, but was left with survivor’s guilt. She started quietly encouraging her workers to prepare an exit strategy. Moments of institutional chaos are always someone’s opportunity, and at Twitter, that person was a product manager named Esther Crawford. Before the takeover, Crawford had been focused on products that let creators make money from their Twitter accounts and one that allowed users to show NFTs on their profiles. When Musk arrived, she began angling for a bigger role. She introduced herself to him on the first day as he mingled with employees at headquarters and soon was pitching him on various ways Twitter could be improved. It worked: Crawford was tasked with relaunching Twitter’s subscription ­product, Twitter Blue. The feature would allow users to pay $8 to get verified and, Musk hoped, wean the company off its dependency on advertisers. The two people who once led the subscription effort were ousted, making Crawford one of the company’s most prominent product leaders. In early November, she posted a picture of herself in an eye mask and sleeping bag at the office: “When your team is pushing round the clock to make deadlines sometimes you #SleepWhereYouWork,” she said.  Even the mass layoffs didn’t deter her. “I feel heartbroken that this process has required many good people to leave ­Twitter, but the business was not profitable and drastic cuts were going to be required to survive, no matter who owned the company,” she wrote on Slack, further alienating herself from colleagues. (Crawford declined to comment.) Musk had made it clear he wanted to do away with Twitter’s old verification method, which he called a “lords & ­peasants system.” To be verified — a symbol that an account had been vetted as authentic — a user had to be approved by someone at Twitter. Blue check marks mostly went to brands, celebrities, and journalists, reinforcing Musk’s belief that the platform was tilted in favor of media elites. To correct this imbalance, Musk wanted to implement a crude pay-to-play scheme. After originally proposing to charge $20 a month for verification, he was talked down to $8 after Stephen King tweeted at his 7 million followers, “$20 a month to keep my blue check? Fuck that, they should pay me. If that gets instituted, I’m gone like Enron.” “The engineers I am bringing back are weak, lazy, unmotivated, and they may even be against an Elon Twitter. They were cut for a reason.” Twitter’s trust and safety team compiled a seven-page document outlining the dangers associated with paid verification. What would stop people from ­impersonating politicians or brands? They ranked the risk a “P0,” the highest possible. But Musk and his team refused to take any recommendations that would delay the launch. Twitter Blue’s paid verification system was unveiled on November 5. Almost immediately, fake verified accounts flooded the platform. An image of Mario giving the middle finger from what looked like the official Nintendo account stayed up for more than a day. An account masquerading as the drug manufacturer Eli Lilly tweeted that insulin would now be free; company executives begged Twitter to take down the tweet. The marketing team tried to do damage control. “You build trust by being transparent, predictable, and thoughtful,” one former employee says. “We were none of those with this launch.” Days after the subscription service debuted, Twitter canned it. Yoel Roth, the head of the team whose warnings had been ignored, resigned. In an all-hands meeting, Musk vowed not to relaunch Twitter Blue until the company had gotten a handle on impersonators. (Shortly after he did, in mid-December, ostensibly with defenses in place, a columnist for the Washington Post managed to get a fake account for a U.S. senator verified.)  Musk’s blundering left a deep scar. ­Twitter Blue was meant to begin shifting Twitter’s sales away from ads toward subscriptions. But while chasing a relatively paltry new cash stream, Musk torched the company’s ad business — the source of the vast majority of its billions in revenue. The Blue disaster accelerated a rush of advertisers abandoning the platform, including Eli Lilly, and by December, what was left of Twitter’s sales team began offering hundreds of thousands of dollars in free ad spend to lure back ­marketers. (It did not work.)  In a series of tweets, Musk blamed the company’s “massive drop in revenue” on “activist groups pressuring advertisers.” To Musk, it was anyone’s fault but his own. The layoffs had left teams in charge of ­Twitter’s most critical infrastructure and user experience with a skeletal staff. Many managers hadn’t been consulted about which of their employees would be fired; after the rapture, they used Google Docs to create lists of workers who still seemed to be active. Then they started angling to rehire some people who had been cut. A debate broke out in the company’s Slack channels. Luke Simon didn’t like the idea of bringing engineers back. Then he did an about-face, angling to bring four recently fired workers onto his team, but not without reservations he aired on Slack. “This is going to be the challenge,” he wrote. “The engineers I am bringing back are weak, lazy, unmotivated, and they may even be against an Elon Twitter. They were cut for a reason.” Ella Irwin, a vice-president, said she had discussed the issue with Musk and reported that he was a “hard no” on rehiring.  The weekend after the layoffs, Musk reversed himself. Twitter’s remaining employees were told they could ask anyone who was fired to come back — with approval from leadership. The directive was given on Saturday, and managers were given till Sunday afternoon to share their lists of whom they wanted to un–lay off. Irwin herself had been fired, but Musk brought her back after Roth resigned. When she’d talked to Musk about taking the job, she brought up her concerns that Twitter executives had historically displayed a relentless focus on juicing the numbers that mattered to Wall Street, often at the expense of making Twitter safer. Musk reassured her that trust and safety would be top priorities and later told her team he didn’t “care about the impact on revenue.” “He’s like, ‘I want you to make the platform safe,’ ” she said. “ ‘If there’s ten other things that come before trust and safety, you’re really not going to be effective as a team.’ ” Irwin believed him. “In my conversation with Elon, what became very clear was he actually really, really, really cares about this, more so than other executives have.” That commitment was immediately tested by being pitted against his other goal of “freeing” speech on Twitter. In the weeks after Musk took over, hate speech spiked across the platform. Slurs against gay men rose 58 percent, antisemitic language was up by 61 percent, and anti-Black slurs more than tripled, according to some estimates. Twitter claimed the rise in hate speech was temporary, but the basic situation was clear: Trolls were testing the boundaries of Musk’s commitment to open discourse. Musk said repeatedly that Twitter’s content-­moderation approach should “hew close to the law,” yet speech laws are different in every country. In the U.S., many forms of hate speech and harassment are legal. But Germany has well-known laws against Nazism and Holocaust denial, and the government of India has wide latitude to request the takedown of speech they don’t like. Musk promised he would leave major decisions, such as whether to reinstate Trump’s account, to a council of experts. Then, on November 19, he reneged and made the decision via public Twitter poll. “The speed at which he moves and expects people to move can be dizzying, for sure,” Irwin says. She still supports Musk. “It’s probably the fastest-moving organization right now that I’ve ever seen in my life.” A former employee saw the Trump ­decision differently: “It shattered the naïve illusion that moderation would be anything more than dancing to the whims of one man’s inflated ego.” On November 10, with just 20 minutes notice, Musk gathered his remaining employees to address them directly for the first time. He spoke frankly about the state of the business and suggested even more layoffs were to come. He also revoked a policy that had promised the entire staff the freedom to work remotely, forever, if they wished. “Basically, if you can show up in an office and you do not show up at the office, resignation accepted. End of story,” he said. Slack and Signal erupted. A lawyer pointed out that this would be a fundamental change to their employment contracts, and employees did not have “an obligation to return to office.” One person said, “That’s so low.” And later, “Ok I’m quitting tomorrow 😂” Alicia decided she too had had enough. She enjoyed working from the office but felt that forcing employees to do so, and on such short notice, was immoral. She told colleagues, first publicly in Slack, then on Twitter, not to resign. “Let him fire you,” she said. Why give Musk what he wanted? Five days later, she was fired. In her termination email, the HR department said her behavior had violated company policy. The next day, she went to the office to retrieve her belongings, sneaking in through the service elevator. She was surprised to feel more relieved than upset. She was free. Twitter might have had a reputation as a left-leaning workforce, but there had always been a faction that disapproved of its progressive ideals. On Slack, some of these workers had formed a channel called #i-dissent, where they asked questions like why deadnaming a trans colleague was considered “bad.” When Musk announced he was buying the company, one of the more active i-­dissenters was thrilled. “Elon’s my new boss and I’m stoked!” he wrote on Linked­In. “I decided to send him a slack message. I figured you miss 100% of the shots you don’t make 😅 🚀 🌕” This employee was cut during the first round of layoffs. Soon, all the prominent members of the #i-dissent Slack channel would be gone. The channel itself was archived, while bigger social channels like #social-watercooler were abandoned. On November 16, Musk emailed his remaining 2,900 employees an ultimatum. He was building Twitter 2.0, he said, and workers would need to be “extremely hardcore,” logging “long hours at high intensity.” The old way of doing business was out. Now, “only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade.” He asked employees to sign a pledge through Google Forms committing to the new standard by the end of the next workday. But who wanted that? Employees were still waiting to be given a coherent vision for what Twitter 2.0 could be. They lacked basic information about the new company, like how they would be compensated now that Twitter was no longer a public company with easily sellable stock. Employees knew what Musk didn’t want — content moderation, free gourmet lunches, people working from home — but had few clues as to what he did want. Besides, was being fired for not checking a box on a Google Form even legal? Word quickly spread that a significant number of employees were going to say no to being “extremely hardcore.” After weeks of trying to get rid of as many employees as possible, Musk and his advisers were suddenly in the awkward position of needing to convince a subset of them to stay. They met with small groups of senior engineers to hear their concerns. But to many, Musk’s handling of the initial layoffs, coupled with the lack of details about what staying for Twitter 2.0 would entail, had soured them for good. As one once-loyal engineer put it, “Fuck Elon Musk.” Hundreds of employees decided not to sign the pledge, effectively resigning. In Slack, they again posted the salute emoji, the unofficial symbol of Twitter 1.0: 🫡 Four days later, Musk took the stage at Twitter headquarters. He was dressed in black jeans and black boots with a black T-shirt that read “I Love Twitter” in barely legible black writing. Flanked by two bodyguards, he tried to articulate his vision for the company. “This is not a right-wing takeover of Twitter,” he told employees. “It is a ­moderate-wing takeover of Twitter.” As employees peppered him with questions, the billionaire free-associated, answering their concerns with smug dismissals and grandiose promises. What about his plan to turn Twitter from a mere social network into a super-app? “You’re not getting it, you’re not understanding,” he said, sounding frustrated. “I just used WeChat as an example. We can’t freakin’ clone WeChat; that would be absurd.” What about rival social platforms? “I don’t think about competitors … I don’t care what Facebook, YouTube, or what anyone else is doing. Couldn’t give a damn. We just need to make Twitter as goddamn amazing as possible.” What about rebuilding Twitter’s leadership team that he’d decimated in his first week? “Initially, there will be a lot of changes, and then over time you’ll see far fewer changes.”  Twitter employees were used to ­grilling their bosses about every detail of how the company ran, an openness that was common at major tech companies around Silicon Valley. Even employees who still believed in Musk’s vision of Twitter hoped for a similar dialogue with their leader. Some expected it, now that the slackers were gone. But over the course of half an hour, Musk made it clear that the two-way street between the CEO and staffers was now closed. By December, more than half the staff was gone, along with all of Twitter’s major perks, including reimbursements for wellness, classes, and day care. Remaining employees were warned not to take long Christmas vacations. Just when morale seemed to be bottoming out, Musk began doxxing their­ colleagues.  Only a small inner circle knew Musk had invited the journalist Matt Taibbi to comb through internal documents and publish what he called “the Twitter Files.” The intention seemed to be to give ­credence to the notion that Twitter is in bed with the deep state, beholden to the clandestine conspiracies of Democrats. “Twitter is both a social media company and a crime scene,” Musk tweeted. In an impossible-to-follow tweet thread that unfolded over several hours, Taibbi published the names and emails of rank-and-file ex-employees involved in communications with government officials, insinuating that Twitter had suppressed the New York Post story about Hunter Biden’s laptop. After it was pointed out that Taibbi had published the personal email of Jack Dorsey, that tweet was deleted, but not the tweets naming low-level employees or the personal email of a sitting congressman.  “What a shitty thing to do,” one worker wrote in a large Slack channel of former employees. “The names of rank and file members being revealed is fucked,” wrote another. Employees rushed to warn a Twitter operations analyst whom Taibbi had doxxed to privatize her social-media accounts, knowing she was about to face a deluge of abuse. It’s an open secret that many employees who remain at Musk’s “hardcore” Twitter are actively looking for other jobs. Soon after, Musk granted access to ­others, including Bari Weiss and Michael Shellenberger, two influential writers who had gained the approval of his social circle, including David Sacks. They published Twitter threads on the company’s handling of covid misinformation and shadow-banning. While the framing was intended to stoke outrage, the internal ­correspondence that was published was more banal. It mostly showed employees having nuanced discussions about complicated, thorny moderation topics and often resisting requests by government agencies to take action. What Musk saw as damning forms of censorship were actually thoughtful conversations about user safety. Musk followed this with a personal attack on Yoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety. After Musk suggested that Roth was sympathetic to pedophilia — a dog whistle harking back to QAnon and Pizzagate — Roth fled his home and went into hiding.  At the same time as he was putting Roth at risk, Musk bent the company’s free-speech policies to protect himself. After one of his children was allegedly stalked by a fan in South Pasadena, Musk blamed a Twitter account that tracked ­public data about the whereabouts of his ­private jet — his “assassination coordinates,” Musk said. He then had Irwin suspend the @ElonJet account, the account of its owner, and dozens of others that tracked celebrities’ planes. Several journalists from CNN, the New York Times, and elsewhere were suspended for tweeting the news. After she was publicly connected with the @ElonJet ban, a former employee says Irwin began insisting that instructions to restore accounts only be delivered verbally, so that the moves would not be linked back to her in Twitter’s systems. (Irwin denies this.) Even Musk’s new ally Weiss denounced the crackdown: “The old regime at Twitter governed by its own whims and biases and it sure looks like the new regime has the same problem. I oppose it in both cases.” Musk responded by unfollowing her. Twitter continues to hemorrhage money, so much so that Musk has stopped paying its bills. The landlords of one of its spaces in San Francisco are suing, ­seeking damages and threatening eviction ­proceedings. Twitter plans to auction off office furniture in January. On Christmas Eve, Twitter abruptly shut down a data center in Sacramento, one of the company’s three serving regions; it also announced it would significantly downsize a data center in Atlanta. Within hours, Twitter had to redirect a large amount of traffic to its remaining data centers, ­threatening the stability of the platform. Engineers struggled to keep the service running. Outages would happen sporadically, the worst one in January, when the site was down for over 12 hours for users in Australia and New Zealand. But it was nothing near the catastrophe Musk’s critics had predicted. Mostly, Twitter kept humming along. Meanwhile, more staff deemed non­essential were let go. In London, receptionists were fired just before the ­holiday. In San Francisco, the janitorial staff was laid off without severance. At one point, the San Francisco office got so low on office supplies that employees began bringing their own toilet paper.  Late in December, Twitter employees noticed a prominent face was gone from Slack: Luke Simon had left the company. No one knew why. Some joked darkly that kissing Musk’s ring wasn’t enough to keep anyone safe anymore. Simon’s ­Twitter account no longer exists. (He did not respond to a request for comment.) The repercussions for Musk’s handling of Twitter are now coming. According to his public-merger agreement and internal Twitter documents, Musk agreed to at least match the company’s existing severance package, which offered two months of pay as well as other valuable benefits. Instead, he laid off employees with the minimum notice required by federal and state law and refused to pay out certain awards. Now more than 500 employees, with Shevat among the highest ranking, are pursuing legal action against Musk for what they are owed, in addition to his alleged discrimination against minority groups in his handling of the layoffs. “I think leadership doesn’t end after you get fired,” says Shevat, adding that he was already paid out for the acquisition of his start-up and isn’t doing this for the money. “I still feel responsible for my team and for my PMs and for my engineers. So I think that this is my way of showing them what is the right thing to do.” Originally, laid-off employees were given a 60-day notice. Now that it is up, they are receiving severance agreements asking them to sign away their right to sue Twitter or say anything negative about the company or Musk for life. In exchange, they get one month of pay before they need to find another job during what is the most difficult hiring market in tech in years. It’s an open secret that many employees who remain at Musk’s “hardcore” Twitter are actively looking for other jobs. Even the most publicly cheerful Twitter workers can’t fully mask the despair. On December 29, one tweeted a selfie, smiling in front of an empty office, with the hashtags #solowork, #productivity, and #findingperspective. Musk himself is starting to appear defeated. Tesla shares started 2022 trading at nearly $400. By September, Tesla’s stock price had dropped by 25 percent. It plummeted again after Musk bought Twitter and ended the year at $123. Investors are begging Musk to step away; Tesla employees are too. As one person on Musk’s transition team put it, “What the fuck does this have to do with cars?” Musk claims he always intended to be Twitter’s CEO only temporarily. With the damage he has done in three months — to the company and to his own wealth — those watching the nosedive, whether with ­horror or Schadenfreude, can’t help but wonder how much longer he can wait. His failures at Twitter have already damaged his reputation as a genius.

We accept credit card, Apple Pay and Google Pay. While both companies flail, Musk remains glued to his feed. It was an outcome Alicia predicted back in April when Musk first floated the idea of buying the company. “He’s too interested in seeking attention,” she said. “Twitter is a very, a very dangerous drug for anybody who has that personality.” As the year came to a close, Musk’s public statements about Twitter veered from pride in the site’s usage metrics (all-time highs, he regularly assured followers) to what might have been more sober self-assessments of his predicament. “Don’t be the clown on the clown car!” he tweeted on December 27. “Too late haha.” If he seemed certain of anything, it was the steadily improving technical architecture of Twitter itself. The staff might be vastly diminished, but what it lacked in size it more than made up for in growing technical competence. Bit by bit, Musk said, Twitter’s notoriously fragile infrastructure was improving.  In some ways, Musk was vindicated. Twitter was less stable now, but the platform survived and mostly functioned even with the majority of employees gone. He had promised to rightsize a bloated company, and now it operated on minimal head count. But Musk appears unaware of what he’s actually broken: the company culture that built Twitter into one of the world’s most influential social networks, the policies that attempted to keep that platform safe, and the trust of users who populate it every day with their conversations, breaking news, and weird jokes — Twitter’s true value and contributions to the world. “Fractal of Rube Goldberg machines … is what it feels like understanding how ­Twitter works,” Musk wrote in a short thread on Christmas Eve. “And yet work it does … Even after I disconnected one of the more sensitive server racks.” Four days later, Twitter crashed. More than 10,000 users, many of them international, submitted reports of problems accessing the site. Some got an error message reading, “Something went wrong, but don’t fret — it’s not your fault.” “Can anyone see this or is Twitter broken,” one user tweeted into the apparent void. But in that moment, Musk found that whatever might be happening in the world at large — to his site, his other companies, his reputation and legacy — that tweet, at least, appeared on his screen as intended. “Works for me,” he replied.

Twitter
1355 Market St #900
San Francisco, CA 94103, Dear Mr. Musk, We write as Jewish organizations concerned about the proliferation of hate speech on Twitter, including antisemitism, and to strongly urge you to act swiftly to address it. Both reports and our own experiences demonstrate an increase in antisemitic and white supremacist posts and images on the platform. The recent disbanding of the Trust and Safety advisory group compounds our concern. A commitment to principles of free speech does not preclude shunning those who traffic in hate. Everyone is entitled to speak, however they are not entitled to a global megaphone to make their vitriol heard. Twitter can be a place for a robust exchange of ideas while refusing to amplify voices that attack others because of their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability. We are equally concerned by several of your own posts that suggest sympathy for white supremacists. This includes your tweets of a photo of a Nazi soldier and Pepe the Frog, which has become a popular meme among the alt-right. No matter your intent, we unequivocally condemn anything that affirms those who espouse hate, including against Jews. History and recent experience demonstrate that online hate inspires real life violence. Perpetrators of the Tree of Life massacre in Squirrel Hill, PA, the Poway, CA synagogue attack, and the hostage taking at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, TX, among others, were all motivated to violence by the online communities of which they were a part. Twitter has shown that it can be a force for good in the world. To continue to be so requires your intentional leadership and unequivocal rejection of antisemitism and all forms of hate. As Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel famously said, ""The opposite of good is not evil; the opposite of good is indifference.” Do not be indifferent to antisemitism spread on the platform you own. We urge you to immediately take meaningful, quantifiable steps to reduce hate on Twitter. Sincerely,   Union for Reform Judaism

In the three months since Musk bought Twitter for £44bn, thousands have been sacked and the company has nosedived.","In the three months since Musk bought Twitter for £44bn, thousands have been sacked and the company has nosedived. Here, staff tell of a firm in disarray and an owner whose reputation is also plummeting  In April 2022, Elon Musk acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter, making him the company’s largest shareholder, and was offered a seat on the board. Luke Simon, a senior engineering director at Twitter, was ecstatic. “Elon Musk is a brilliant engineer and scientist, and he has a track record of having a Midas touch when it comes to growing the companies he’s helped lead,” he wrote on the workplace messaging platform Slack. Twitter had been defined by the leadership of Jack Dorsey – a co-founder who was known for going on long meditation retreats, fasting 22 hours a day, and walking five miles to the office – who was seen by some as an absentee landlord, leaving Twitter’s strategy and daily operations to a handful of trusted deputies. To Simon and those like him, it was hard to see Twitter as anything other than wasted potential. In its early days, when Twitter was at its most Twittery, circa 2012, executives called the company “the free-speech wing of the free-speech party”. That was the era when the platform was credited for amplifying the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Arab spring, when it seemed like giving everyone a microphone might actually bring down dictatorships and right the wrongs of neoliberal capitalism. Frequently, the platform set the news agenda. What it lacked in profits it more than made up for in influence. No one understood how to weaponise that influence better than Donald Trump, who in 2016 propelled himself into the White House in part by harnessing hate and vitriol via his @realDonaldTrump feed. A new consensus that the site was a sewer made it worth a lot less money. Musk had offered to buy the company for the absurdly inflated price of $44bn. The move thrilled employees like Simon who chafed at Twitter’s laidback atmosphere and reputation for developing new features at a glacial pace. Other employees noted the darker motifs of Musk’s career – the disregard for labour relations, the many current lawsuits alleging sexual harassment and racial discrimination at his companies – and found his interest in Twitter ominous. On Slack, a product manager responded to Simon’s enthusiasm for Musk with scepticism: “I take your point, but as a childhood Greek mythology nerd, I feel it is important to point out that the story behind the idea of the Midas touch is not a positive one. It’s a cautionary tale about what is lost when you only focus on wealth.” The comment would prove to be prophetic. According to more than two dozen current and former Twitter staffers, Musk has, since buying the company in October 2022, shown a remarkable lack of interest in the people and processes that make his new toy tick. He has purged thousands of employees, implemented ill-advised policies, and angered even some of his most loyal supporters. If “free speech” was his mandate for Twitter the platform, it has been the opposite for Twitter the workplace. Dissenting opinion or criticism has led to swift dismissals. Musk replaced Twitter’s old culture with one of his own, but it’s unclear, with so few workers and plummeting revenues, whether or not this new version will survive. On 26 October 2022, an engineer – let’s call her Alicia – sat in a glass conference room in San Francisco trying to explain the details of Twitter’s tech stack to Elon Musk. He was supposed to officially buy the company in two days, and Alicia and a small group of trusted colleagues were tasked with outlining how its core infrastructure worked. But Musk, who was sitting two seats away from Alicia with his elbows propped on the table, looked sleepy. When he did talk, it was to ask questions about cost. How much does Twitter spend on data centres? Why was everything so expensive? Fine, she thought. If Musk wants to know about money, I’ll tell him. She launched into a technical explanation of the company’s data-centre efficiency, curious to see if he would follow. Instead, he interrupted. “I was writing C programs in the 90s,” he said dismissively. “I understand how computers work.” David Sacks, a venture capitalist and friend of Musk’s who had advised him on the acquisition, walked into the room. “David, this meeting is too technical for you,” Musk said, waving his hand to dismiss Sacks. Wordlessly, Sacks turned and walked out, leaving the engineers in the room – who had received little engagement from Musk on anything technical – slack-jawed. His imperiousness in the middle of a session he appeared to be botching was something to behold. (Sacks disputes this account of the meeting.) The next day, Alicia and her colleagues gathered in the cafeteria of Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters for a long-planned Halloween party. The room was decorated with miniature pumpkins and fake spiderwebs. Employees tried to get in the holiday spirit, but rumours were swirling that Musk planned to cut 75% of the company. People were sobbing in the bathrooms. One company leader recalled the surreal moment of crying about the end of Twitter as they knew it, only to look up and see a person in a Jack Sparrow costume amble by. The days surrounding the acquisition passed in a blur of ominous, unlikely scenes. Musk posing as the world’s richest prop comic, announcing his takeover by lugging a kitchen sink into the office: “Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!” (181.2k retweets, 43.6k quote tweets, 1.3m likes). A fleet of Teslas in the parking lot. Musk’s intimidating security detail standing outside his glass conference room as if guarding the leader of a developing nation. Musk’s two-year-old son, X Æ A-Xii, toddling around the second floor, occasionally crying. Employees braced for layoffs, but no word came from Musk. People hunted for information on their unofficial chats while glued, like everyone else, to Musk’s Twitter feed for news. “Hey all don’t forget to complete your q3 goals!” one employee wrote darkly on Slack. “Writes, ‘stay employed,’” responded a colleague. Musk brought in a cadre of close advisers, including Sacks – to employees, this crew would be known by only one name: the Goons. On Musk’s first full day in charge, 28 October, the executive assistants sent Twitter engineers a Slack message at the behest of the Goons: the boss wanted to see their code. Employees were instructed to “print out 50 pages of code you’ve done in the last 30 days” and get ready to show it to Musk in person. Panicked engineers started hunting around the office for printers. Within a couple of hours, the Goons’ assistants sent out a new missive to the team: “UPDATE: Stop printing,” it read. “Please be ready to show your recent code (within last 30-60 [days] preferably) on your computer. If you have already printed, please shred in the bins on SF-Tenth. Thank you!” The botched code review did little to deter the Goons, who still needed to figure out which of Twitter’s 7,500 employees were needed to keep the site running – and who could be jettisoned. At 10 that same night, they told managers they should “stack rank” their teams, a common but cold method of evaluation that forces managers to designate their lowest performers. Amir Shevat, who managed Twitter’s developer platform and had led large teams at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, was perplexed. Every company did stack ranking differently. Should they sort workers by seniority? Impact? Revenue generated? No one had an answer. “They said, ‘We don’t know. Elon wants a stack rank,’” Shevat says. The project succeeded in generating large lists of names, but because different managers had ranked employees according to their own methods, the results were incoherent. Meanwhile, managers were fielding worried questions from workers, but the only one that mattered – “Will I still have a job here?” – no one could answer. Even Shevat didn’t know if his position was safe. The following week, on 3 November, employees received an unsigned email from “Twitter” relaying that the time for layoffs had started. By 9am the following day, everyone would receive a note telling them whether they still had a job. That night, hundreds of employees gathered in a Slack channel called #social-watercooler, which had become the company’s de facto town square since Musk took over. They posted salute emoji and blue hearts – solidarity for those who were being cut and for those who deeply wanted to be shown the door but were somehow asked to stay. One person posted a meme of Thanos from Avengers: Infinity War, the supervillain who exterminates half the living beings in the universe with a snap. By morning, half the workforce had lost their jobs, well over 3,000 people. The layoffs wiped out Shevat and his entire team. Alicia kept her position, but was left with survivor’s guilt. She started quietly encouraging her workers to prepare an exit strategy. Moments of institutional chaos are always someone’s opportunity, and at Twitter, that person was a product manager named Esther Crawford. Before the takeover, Crawford had been focused on products that let creators make money from their Twitter accounts. When Musk arrived, she began angling for a bigger role and soon was pitching him on various ways Twitter could be improved. It worked: Crawford was tasked with relaunching Twitter’s subscription product, Twitter Blue. Musk had made it clear he wanted to do away with Twitter’s old verification method, which he called a “lords and peasants system”. To be verified – a symbol that an account had been vetted as authentic – a user had to be approved by someone at Twitter. Blue check marks mostly went to brands, celebrities, and journalists, reinforcing Musk’s belief that the platform was tilted in favour of media elites. To correct this imbalance, Musk wanted to implement a crude pay-to-play scheme. After originally proposing to charge $20 a month for verification, he was talked down to $8 after Stephen King tweeted at his 7 million followers: “$20 a month to keep my blue check? Fuck that, they should pay me. If that gets instituted, I’m gone like Enron.” Twitter’s trust and safety team compiled a seven-page document outlining the dangers associated with paid verification. What would stop people from impersonating politicians or brands? They ranked the risk a “P0”, the highest possible. But Musk and his team refused to take any recommendations that would delay the launch. In early November, Crawford posted a picture of herself in an eye mask and sleeping bag at the office: “When your team is pushing round the clock to make deadlines sometimes you #SleepWhereYouWork,” she said. When your team is pushing round the clock to make deadlines sometimes you #SleepWhereYouWork https://t.co/UBGKYPilbD Twitter Blue’s paid verification system was unveiled on 5 November. Almost immediately, fake verified accounts flooded the platform. An image of Mario giving the middle finger from what looked like the official Nintendo account stayed up for more than a day. An account masquerading as the drug manufacturer Eli Lilly tweeted that insulin would now be free; company executives begged Twitter to take down the tweet. The marketing team tried to do damage control. “You build trust by being transparent, predictable, and thoughtful,” one former employee says. “We were none of those with this launch.” Days after the subscription service debuted, Twitter canned it. Yoel Roth, the head of the team whose warnings had been ignored, resigned. Musk’s blundering left a deep scar. Twitter Blue was meant to begin shifting Twitter’s revenue away from ads toward subscriptions. But while chasing a relatively paltry new cash stream, Musk torched the company’s ad business – the source of the vast majority of its billions in revenue. The Blue disaster accelerated a rush of advertisers abandoning the platform, including pharmaceuticals giant Eli Lilly, and by December, what was left of Twitter’s sales team began offering hundreds of thousands of dollars in free ad spend to lure back marketers. Sign up to TechScape Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion In a series of tweets, Musk blamed the company’s “massive drop in revenue” on “activist groups pressuring advertisers”. To Musk, it was anyone’s fault but his own. On 10 November, with just 20 minutes’ notice, Musk gathered his remaining employees to address them directly for the first time. He spoke frankly about the state of the business and suggested even more layoffs were to come. He also revoked a policy that had promised the entire staff the freedom to work remotely, forever, if they wished. “Basically, if you can show up in an office and you do not show up at the office, resignation accepted. End of story,” he said. Slack and Signal erupted. A lawyer pointed out that this would be a fundamental change to their employment contracts, and employees did not have “an obligation to return to office”. Alicia decided she had had enough. She enjoyed working from the office but felt that forcing employees to do so, and on such short notice, was immoral. She told colleagues not to resign. “Let him fire you,” she said. Why give Musk what he wanted? Five days later, she was fired. On 16 November, Musk emailed his remaining 2,900 employees an ultimatum. He was building Twitter 2.0, he said, and workers would need to be “extremely hardcore”, logging “long hours at high intensity”. The old way of doing business was out. Now, “only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade”. He asked employees to sign a pledge through Google Forms committing to the new standard by the end of the next workday. But who wanted that? Employees were still waiting to be given a coherent vision for what Twitter 2.0 could be. Employees knew what Musk didn’t want – content moderation, free gourmet lunches, people working from home – but had few clues as to what he did want. Besides, was being fired for not checking a box on a Google Form even legal? By December, more than half the staff was gone. Remaining employees were warned not to take long Christmas vacations. Just when morale seemed to be bottoming out, Musk began doxing [publishing private information online] their colleagues. Only a small inner circle knew Musk had invited the journalist Matt Taibbi to comb through internal documents and publish what he called “the Twitter Files”. The intention seemed to be to give credence to the notion that Twitter is in bed with the deep state, beholden to the clandestine conspiracies of Democrats. “Twitter is both a social media company and a crime scene,” Musk tweeted. In an impossible-to-follow tweet thread that unfolded over several hours, Taibbi published the names and emails of rank and file ex-employees involved in communications with government officials, insinuating that Twitter had suppressed the New York Post story about Hunter Biden’s laptop. After it was pointed out that Taibbi had published the personal email of Jack Dorsey, that tweet was deleted, but not the tweets naming low-level employees or the personal email of a sitting congressman. Employees rushed to warn a Twitter operations analyst whom Taibbi had doxed to privatise her social media accounts, knowing she was about to face a deluge of abuse. While his journalists were putting former employees at risk, Musk bent the company’s free speech policies to protect himself. After one of his children was allegedly stalked by a fan in South Pasadena, Musk blamed a Twitter account that tracked public data about the whereabouts of his private jet – his “assassination coordinates”, Musk said. He then suspended @ElonJet account, the account of its owner, and dozens of others that tracked celebrities’ planes. Several journalists from CNN, the New York Times and elsewhere were suspended for tweeting the news. One of Musk’s other Twitter Files journalists, Bari Weiss, denounced the crackdown: “The old regime at Twitter governed by its own whims and biases and it sure looks like the new regime has the same problem. I oppose it in both cases.” Musk responded by unfollowing her. Twitter continues to haemorrhage money, so much so that Musk has stopped paying its bills. The landlords of Twitter offices in San Francisco and London are suing over unpaid rent. And this month Twitter has been auctioning office furniture. On Christmas Eve, Twitter abruptly shut down a data centre in Sacramento, California; it also announced it would significantly downsize a data centre in Atlanta, Georgia. Engineers struggled to keep the service running. Outages would happen sporadically, the worst one in January, when the site was down for more than 12 hours for users in Australia and New Zealand. But it was nothing near the catastrophe Musk’s critics had predicted. Twitter Blue was relaunched and mostly, the platform kept humming along. Late in December, Twitter employees noticed a prominent face was gone from Slack: Luke Simon had left the company. No one knew why. Some joked darkly that kissing Musk’s ring wasn’t enough to keep anyone safe any more. Simon’s Twitter account no longer exists. The repercussions for Musk’s handling of Twitter are now coming. According to his public-merger agreement and internal Twitter documents, Musk agreed to at least match the company’s existing severance package, which offered two months’ pay as well as other valuable benefits. Instead, he laid off employees with the minimum notice required by federal and state law and refused to pay out certain awards. Now more than 500 employees, with Shevat among the highest-ranking, are pursuing legal action against Musk for what they are owed, in addition to his alleged discrimination against minority groups in his handling of the layoffs. “I think leadership doesn’t end after you get fired,” says Shevat, adding that he was already paid out for the acquisition of his startup and isn’t doing this for the money. Musk himself is starting to appear defeated. Tesla shares started 2022 trading at nearly $400. By September, Tesla’s stock price had dropped by 25%. It plummeted again after Musk bought Twitter and ended the year at $123. Investors are begging Musk to step away; Tesla employees are too. As one person on Musk’s transition team put it, “What the fuck does this have to do with cars?” Musk claims he always intended to be Twitter’s CEO only temporarily. With the damage he has done in three months – to the company and to his own wealth – those watching the nosedive, whether with horror or schadenfreude, can’t help but wonder how much longer he can wait. His failures at Twitter have already damaged his reputation as a genius. How smart could he really be, the guy who purchased a company for far more than it was worth, then drove what remained of it into the ground? As the year came to a close, Musk’s public statements about Twitter veered from pride in the site’s usage metrics (all-time highs, he regularly assured followers) to what might have been more sober self-assessments of his predicament. “Don’t be the clown on the clown car!” he tweeted on 27 December. “Too late haha.” If he seemed certain of anything, it was the steadily improving technical architecture of Twitter itself. The staff might be vastly diminished, but what it lacked in size it more than made up for in growing technical competence. Bit by bit, Musk said, Twitter’s notoriously fragile infrastructure was improving. In some ways, Musk was vindicated. Twitter was less stable now, but the platform survived and mostly functioned even with the majority of employees gone. He had promised to rightsize a bloated company, and now it operated on minimal headcount. But Musk appears unaware of what he’s actually broken: the company culture that built Twitter into one of the world’s most influential social networks, the policies that attempted to keep that platform safe, and the trust of users who populate it every day with their conversations, breaking news, and weird jokes – Twitter’s true value and contributions to the world. “Fractal of Rube Goldberg machines… is what it feels like understanding how Twitter works,” Musk wrote in a short thread on Christmas Eve. “And yet work it does… Even after I disconnected one of the more sensitive server racks.” Four days later, Twitter crashed. More than 10,000 users, many of them international, submitted reports of problems accessing the site. Some got an error message reading: “Something went wrong, but don’t fret – it’s not your fault.” “Can anyone see this or is Twitter broken,” one user tweeted into the apparent void. But in that moment, Musk found that whatever might be happening in the world at large – to his site, his other companies, his reputation and legacy – that tweet, at least, appeared on his screen as intended. “Works for me,” he replied. This is an edited extract of an article that first appeared in New York magazine and The Verge."

Twitter will discontinue offering free access to the Twitter API starting February 9 and will launch a paid version.","Twitter will discontinue offering free access to the Twitter API starting February 9 and will launch a paid version, the Elon Musk-owned microblogging website said as it looks for more avenues to monetize the platform. In a series of tweets, the Twitter Developer account said the firm will be ending support for both legacy v1.1 and the new v2 of its Twitter APIs. It did not immediately say how much it plans to charge for API usage. The move follows Twitter abruptly changing the terms of its API in recent weeks; the API was used by many popular Twitter clients, such as Tweetbot and Twitterrific. Most third-party Twitter apps have shut down their mobile apps. “Twitter data are among the world’s most powerful data sets. We’re committed to enabling fast & comprehensive access so you can continue to build with us,” Twitter Dev account said Thursday. “Over the years, hundreds of millions of people have sent over a trillion Tweets, with billions more every week.” “we cut everyone off with no notice but now we would like you to pay us instead” 😂 https://t.co/VMtTAJYxNY — Owen Williams ⚡ (@ow) February 2, 2023  In the aftermath of the recent changes that saw Twitter shutter third-party clients, many other app developers had grown cautious about the ways they advanced development atop of the Twitter API. This new move might leave some developers to either abandon their products or pass on the cost to their customers. Thousands of developers use the Twitter API for scores of things such as tracking changes among Twitter accounts and offering alerts. These are fun side projects for people who might not be willing to pay fees for something that they themselves are not monetizing. Then there is another specific user base of the Twitter API: Researchers. Twitter’s new announcement might impact research in different areas, including hate speech and online abuse. Universities often use Twitter to study human behavior in different regions. Putting a cap on free API usage could also stop firms working around detecting the spread of misinformation on Twitter. Twitter has had a strange relationship with developers since its inception. But the relationship, however inconvenient, was benign for both parties. Third-party firms were often the ones shipping new products and features for Twitter and the social network did its part by not charging them for the API usage. In recent years, Twitter even attempted to repair relationships with developers by launching new programs like the Twitter toolbox for app discovery. Several of such initiatives have been shut down under the new management. Under Musk’s helm, Twitter is scrambling to control how users around the globe access the platform as it broadens its attempts to monetize the service. Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion in late October. He took a loan of about $12.5 billion to finance the deal. To keep Twitter alive, a service that is not profitable, Musk has to pay an additional $1.5 billion a year in interest alone. So naturally, Musk is pushing to make Twitter more self-sustainable. Twitter has revamped — and made more expensive — its subscription service and tweaked how tweets appear on a user’s timeline to make the platform more engaging, lucrative and an attractive destination for an otherwise increasingly dwindling advertiser base.

					Santa Monica's trusted source of essential news for 22 years				  MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Technology Writer While still grappling with the fallout from a company he did take private, beleaguered billionaire Elon Musk is now facing a trial over a company he didn’t. Long before Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion in October, he had set his sights on Tesla, the electric automaker where he continues to serve as CEO and from which he derives most of his wealth and fame. Musk claimed in a August 7, 2018 tweet that he had lined up the financing to pay for a $72 billion buyout of Tesla, which he then amplified with a follow-up statement that made a deal seem imminent. But the buyout never materialized and now Musk will have to explain his actions under oath in a federal court in San Francisco. The trial, which begins on Tuesday with jury selection, was triggered by a class-action lawsuit on behalf of investors who owned Tesla stock for a 10-day period in August 2018. Musk’s tweets back then fueled a rally in Tesla’s stock price that abruptly ended a week later, after it became apparent that he didn’t have the funding for a buyout after all. That resulted in him scrapping his plan to take the automaker private, culminating in a $40 million settlement with U.S. securities regulators that also required him to step down as the company’s chairman. Musk has since contended he entered that settlement under duress and maintained he believed he had locked up financial backing for a Tesla buyout during meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. Premium Santa Monica news in your inbox. It's free, cancel anytime. The trial’s outcome may hinge on the jury’s interpretation of Musk’s motive for tweets that U.S. District Judge Edward Chen has already decided were a falsehood. Chen dealt Musk another setback on Friday, when he rejected Musk’s bid to transfer the trial to a federal court in Texas, where Tesla moves its headquarters in 2021. Musk had argued that negative coverage of his Twitter purchase had poisoned the jury pool in the San Francisco Bay Area. Musk’s leadership of Twitter — where he has gutted the staff and alienated users and advertisers — has proven unpopular among Tesla’s current stockholders, who are worried he has been devoting less time steering the automaker at a time of intensifying competition. Those concerns contributed to a 65% percent decline in Tesla’s stock last year that wiped out more than $700 billion in shareholder wealth — far more than the $14 billion swing in fortune that occurred between the company’s high and low stock prices during the Aug. 7-17, 2018 period covered in the class-action lawsuit. The lawsuit is based on the premise that Tesla’s shares wouldn’t have traded at such a wide range if Musk hadn’t dangled the prospect of buying the company for $420 per share. Tesla’s stock has split twice since then, making that $420 price worth $28 on adjusted basis now. The shares closed last week at $122.40, down from its November 2021 split-adjusted peak of $414.50. After Musk dropped the idea of a Tesla buyout, the company overcame a production problem, resulting in a rapid upturn in car sales that caused its stock to soar and minted Musk as the world’s richest person until he bought Twitter. Musk dropped from the top spot on the wealth list after the stock market’s backlash to his handling of Twitter. The trial is likely to provide insights into Musk’s management style, given the witness list includes some of Tesla’s current and former top executives and board members, including luminaries such as Larry Ellison, Oracle co-founder, as well as James Murdoch, the son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The drama also may shed light on Musk’s relationship with his brother, Kimbal, who is also on the list of potential witnesses who may be called during a trial scheduled to continue through Feb. 1.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Elon Musk took the witness stand Friday to defend a 2018 tweet claiming he had lined up the financing to take Tesla ...","Sign In Register SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Elon Musk took the witness stand Friday to defend a 2018 tweet claiming he had lined up the financing to take Tesla private in a deal that never came close to happening. The tweet resulted in a $40 million settlement with securities regulators. It also led to a class-action lawsuit alleging he misled investors, pulling him into court for about a half hour Friday to deliver sworn testimony in front of a nine-person jury and a full room of media and other spectators. The trial was then adjourned for the weekend and Musk was told to return Monday to answer more questions. In his initial appearance on the stand, Musk defended his prolific tweeting as “the most democratic way” to distribute information even while acknowledging constraints of Twitter's 280-character limit can make it difficult to make everything as clear as possible. “I think you can absolutely be truthful (on Twitter),” Musk asserted on the stand. “But can you be comprehensive? Of course not,” Musk's latest headache stems from the inherent brevity on Twitter, a service that he has been running since completing his $44 billion purchase of it in October.  The trial hinges on the question of whether a pair of tweets that Musk posted on Aug. 7, 2018, damaged Tesla shareholders during a 10-day period leading up to a Musk admission that the buyout he had envisioned wasn’t going to happen. In the first of those those two 2018 tweets, Musk stated “funding secured” for a what would have been a $72 billion buyout of Tesla at a time when the electric automaker was still grapping with production problems and was worth far less than it is now. Musk followed up a few hours later with another tweet suggesting a deal was imminent.  After it became apparent that the money wasn't in place to take Tesla private, Musk stepped down as Tesla’s chairman while remaining CEO as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission settlement, without acknowledging any wrongdoing. The impulsive billionaire came into court wearing a dark suit and tie on the third day of the civil trial in San Francisco that his lawyer unsuccessfully tried to move to Texas, where Tesla is now headquartered, on the premise that media coverage of his tumultuous takeover of Twitter had tainted the jury pool. The jury that was assembled earlier this week focused intently on Musk while he answered questions posed by Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer representing Tesla shareholders. At one point, Musk asked Porritt if he would speak closer to the microphone so he could hear him better. At other times, Musk craned his neck as he gazed around the courtroom. Musk, 51, said he cares “a great deal” about investors and also railed against short sellers who make investments that reward them when a company's stock price falls. He called short selling an “evil” practice that should be outlawed, denigrating those who profit from it as “a bunch of sharks."" When shown communications from Tesla investors urging him to curtail or completely stop his Twitter habit before the 2018 buyout tweet, Musk said he couldn't remember all those interactions from years ago, especially since he gets a “Niagara Falls"" of emails. Even before Musk took the stand, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen had declared that the jurors can consider those two tweets to be false, leaving them to decide whether Musk deliberately deceived investors and whether his statements saddled them with losses. Musk has previously contended he entered into the SEC settlement under duress and maintained he believed he had locked up financial backing for a Tesla buyout during meetings with representatives from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. An expert on corporate buyouts hired by shareholder lawyers to study the events surrounding Musk's proposal to take Tesla private spent the bulk of his three hours on the stand Friday deriding the plan as an ill-conceived concept. “This proposal was an extreme outlier,” said Guhan Subramanian, a Harvard University business and law professor for more than 20 years. “It was incoherent. It was illusory.” In a lengthy cross examination that delayed Musk's appearance, a lawyer for Tesla's board of directors tried to undermine Subramanian's testimony by pointing out that it relied on graduate student assistance to review some of the material related to the August 2018 tweets. The lawyer, William Price, also noted Subramanian's $1,900-per-hour fee for compiling his report for the case. The trial over his Tesla tweets come at a time when Musk has been focusing on Twitter while also serving as the automaker's CEO and also remaining deeply involved in SpaceX, the rocket ship company he founded.  Musk’s leadership of Twitter — where he has gutted the staff and alienated users and advertisers — has proven unpopular among Tesla’s current stockholders, who are worried he has been devoting less time steering the automaker at a time of intensifying competition. Those concerns contributed to a 65% decline in Tesla’s stock last year that wiped out more than $700 billion in shareholder wealth — far more than the $14 billion swing in fortune that occurred between the company’s high and low stock prices during the Aug. 7-17, 2018 period covered in the class-action lawsuit.  Tesla’s stock has split twice since then, making the $420 buyout price cited in his 2018 tweet worth $28 on adjusted basis now. The company's shares were trading around $133.42 Friday, down from the company’s November 2021 split-adjusted peak of $414.50. After Musk dropped the idea of a Tesla buyout, the company overcame its production problems, resulting in a rapid upturn in car sales that caused its stock to soar and minted Musk as the world’s richest person until he bought Twitter. Musk dropped from the top spot on the wealth list after the stock market’s backlash to his handling of Twitter. When asked Friday about the challenges that Tesla faced in 2018, he recalled spending many nights sleeping at the automaker's California factory as he tried to keep the company afloat.  “The sheer level of pain to make Tesla successful during that 2017, 2018 period was excruciating,"" he recalled.  ___ This story has been updated to correct that Twitter’s character limit is 280 characters, not 240.

Elon Musk was depicted Wednesday as either a liar who callously jeopardized the savings of “regular people” or a well-intentioned visionary ...","Advertisement FILE - Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, attends the opening of the Tesla factory Berlin Brandenburg in Gruenheide, Germany, March 22, 2022. (Patrick Pleul/Pool via AP, File)  
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Elon Musk was depicted Wednesday as either a liar who callously jeopardized the savings of “regular people” or a well-intentioned visionary as attorneys delivered opening statements at a trial focused on a Tesla buyout that never happened. 
	Lawyers on opposing sides drew the starkly different portraits of Musk for a nine-person jury that will hear the three-week trial. The case is focused on two August 2018 tweets that the billionaire posted on Twitter, which he now owns. 
	The tweets indicated that Musk had lined up the financing to take Tesla private at a time when the automaker's stock was slumping amid production problems. 
	The prospect of a $72 billion buyout fueled a rally in the company's stock price that abruptly ended a week later after it became apparent that he did not have the funding to pull off the deal after all. Tesla shareholders then sued him, saying that Tesla shares would not have swung so widely in value if he had not dangled the idea of buying the company for $420 per share. 
	Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer representing Glen Littleton and other Tesla shareholders in the class-action case, promptly vilified Musk as he addressed jurors. 
	“Why are we here?” Porritt asked. “We are here because Elon Musk, chairman and chief executive of Tesla, lied. His lies caused regular people like Glen Littleton to lose millions and millions of dollars.” He also asserted that Musk's tweet also hurt pension funds and other organizations that owned Tesla stock at the time. 
	Musk's lawyer, Alex Spiro, countered that the run-up in Tesla's stock after the tweet mostly reflected investors' belief in Musk's ability to pull off stunning feats, including building the world's largest electric automaker while also running SpaceX, a maker of rocket ships. 
	“Mr. Musk tries to do things that have never been done before. Everyone knows that,” Spiro told the jury. 
	Spiro added that Musk had been in advanced talks with representatives from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund to take Tesla private. 
	“He didn't plan to tweet this,” Spiro said of Musk's Aug. 7, 2018, statement at the heart of the trial. “It was a split-second decision” aimed at being as transparent as possible about the discussions with the Saudi fund about a potential deal. 
	After saying “funding secured” for the buyout, Musk followed up with another tweet that suggested a deal was imminent. 
	Littleton, a 71-year-old investor from Kansas City, Missouri, was the first witness called to the stand. He said Musk's claim about the financing alarmed him because he had purchased Tesla investments designed to reward him for his belief that the automaker's stock would eventually be worth far more than the $420. 
	He said he sold most of his holdings to cut his losses but still saw the value of his Tesla portfolio plunge by 75%. 
	“The damage was done,” Littleton lamented. “I was in a state of shock.” 
	Littleton's frustration escalated in October 2018, when he lashed out at Tesla for late deliveries on vehicles for some of his nieces and nephews. That led him to become a lead investor in the lawsuit. 
	“I still believe in Tesla to this day. I do,” Littleton said. 
	During cross-examination, a lawyer for Tesla's board of directors repeatedly questioned whether Littleton had legitimate reason to believe a buyout was inevitable, but the investor remained steadfast even while seeming confused at times. 
	“'Funding secured' was the only thing that mattered to me,” Littleton testified. “That was such a defining statement.” 
	Musk's 2018 tweets attracted the attention of securities regulators, who concluded that they were improper and that he was lying. In a settlement, they forced him to pay $40 million and required him to step down as Tesla chairman. 
	U.S. District Judge Edward Chen, who is presiding over the trial, ruled that the shareholders' lawyers can't mention that settlement in the case. 
	But Chen has already ruled that Musk's tweet was false, a finding that can be alluded to during the trial without specifically mentioning the determination made by the judge. Pollitt seized on that opportunity during his opening statement, informing jurors that they are to assume Musk's tweet was false, as the judge allowed. Spiro shook his head as he listened. 
	The trial's outcome may turn on the jury's interpretation of Musk's motive for the tweets. And Musk will have his chance to make his case to the jury. 
	After the trial adjourned Wednesday, Porritt told The Associated Press he hopes to call Musk to the stand when the proceedings resume Friday after two other witnesses testify. If the allotted time runs out Friday, Musk will likely testify Monday, Porritt said. 
	Musk's leadership of Twitter - where he has gutted the staff and alienated users and advertisers - has proven unpopular among Tesla's current stockholders, who are worried that he has been devoting less time to automaker at a time of intensifying competition. 
	Those concerns contributed to a 65% percent decline in Tesla's stock last year that wiped out more than $700 billion in shareholder wealth - far more than the $14 billion swing that occurred between the company's high and low stock prices from Aug. 7 to Aug. 17, 2018, the period covered in the lawsuit. 
	Tesla's stock has split twice since then, making the $420 price cited in his 2018 tweet worth $28 on adjusted basis now. The shares closed Wednesday at $128.78, down from the company's November 2021 split-adjusted peak of $414.50. 
	After Musk dropped the idea of a Tesla buyout, the company overcame a production problem, resulting in a rapid upturn in car sales that caused its stock to soar and made Musk the world's richest person until he bought Twitter. Musk dropped from the top spot on the wealth list after a stock market backlash to his handling of Twitter.

Amb un patrimoni net estimat en uns 139.000 ...","Elon Reeve Musk FRS (Pretòria, 28 de juny de 1971) és un empresari, inversor i magnat dels negocis sud-africà.  Amb un patrimoni net estimat en uns 139.000 milions de dòlars el desembre de 2022,[1] Musk és la segona persona més rica del món segons l'Índex de Multimilionaris de Bloomberg i la llista de multimilionaris en temps real de Forbes.[2][3] El 2021 va ser proclamat ""persona més influent de l'any"" per la revista de prestigi TIME. 
Entre els seus càrrecs executius més destacats hi figuren els següents:  
Musk es va convertir el 2022 en el primer multimilionari en perdre més de 200.000 milions de dòlars, després d'haver estat dos anys abans el primer que els havia superat. Amb la caiguda de la seva fortuna fins a 140.000 milions de dòlars des dels 340.000 milions, aquest any el va acabar perdent la posició de persona més rica del món. El motiu principal fou sobretot la caiguda del valor de Tesla en un 68% durant l'any.[4] 
Musk va néixer de mare canadenca i pare sudafricà blanc, i es va criar a Pretòria (Sud-àfrica). Va estudiar breument a la Universitat de Pretòria abans de traslladar-se al Canadà als 17 anys. Es va matricular a la Queen's University i es va traslladar a la Universitat de Pennsilvània dos anys després, on es va llicenciar en economia i física. El 1995 es va traslladar a Califòrnia per assistir a la Universitat de Stanford, però al seu lloc va començar la seva carrera com a empresari, cofundant l'empresa de programari web Zip2 amb el seu germà Kimbal. L'empresa va ser adquirida per Compaq per 307 milions de dòlars el 1999. Aquest mateix any, Musk va cofundar el banc en línia X.com, que es va fusionar amb Confinity el 2000 per formar PayPal. L'empresa va ser comprada per eBay el 2002 per 1.500 milions de dòlars. 
El 2002, Musk va fundar SpaceX, un fabricant aeroespacial i empresa de serveis de transport espacial, de la qual és conseller delegat i enginyer en cap. El 2004, es va unir al fabricant de vehicles elèctrics Tesla Motors, Inc. (ara Tesla, Inc.) com a president i arquitecte de productes, convertint-se en el seu executiu en cap el 2008. El 2006, va ajudar a crear SolarCity, una empresa de serveis de energia solar que posteriorment va ser adquirida per Tesla i es va convertir en Tesla Energy. El 2015, va cofundar OpenAI, una empresa de recerca sense ànim de lucre que promou la intel·ligència artificial amigable. El 2016, va cofundar Neuralink, una empresa de neurotecnologia centrada en el desenvolupament d'interfícies cervell-ordinador, i va fundar The Boring Company, una empresa de construcció de túnels. També va acordar la compra de la important xarxa social nord-americana Twitter el 2022 per 44.000 milions de dòlars. Musk ha proposat Hyperloop, un sistema de transport d'alta velocitat en el buit. 
Elon Reeve Musk va néixer el 28 de juny de 1971 a Pretòria, Transvaal, Sud-àfrica.[5][6] La seva mare és Maye Musk (el seu cognom de soltera era Haldeman), una model i dietista nascuda a Saskatchewan, Canadà, si bé va créixer a Sud-àfrica.[7][8][9] El seu pare és Errol Musk, un enginyer electromecànic sudafricà, pilot i mariner.[10] Té un germà més jove, Kimbal (nascut l'any 1972), i una germana més jove, Tosca (nascuda el 1974).[9][11] El seu avi matern, Joshua Haldeman, va néixer als Estats Units, però era d'origen canadenc.[12] La seva àvia paterna tenia avantpassats britànics i holandesos de Pennsilvània.[13][14] 
Després del divorci dels seus pares el 1980, Musk va viure majoritàriament amb el seu pare en una zona residencial de Pretòria.[15][16] Amb el temps, Musk s'ha allunyat del seu pare, a qui considera ""una persona terrible... qualsevol cosa maligna que puguis imaginar, ell l'ha feta."" [16] Té una mig-germana i un mig-germà de la banda del seu pare .[17][18] 
Amb 10 anys, es va interessar per la programació, mentre utilitzava un Commodore VIC-20.[19] Va aprendre programació informàtica mitjançant un manual i, als 12 anys, va vendre el codi d'un videojoc basat en BASIC anomenat Blastar a la revista PC and Office Technology per aproximadament 500$.[20][21] Musk era un nen introvertit i va patir assetjament escolar fins al punt d'haver de ser hospitalitzat quan uns nens el van tirar daltabaix d'unes escales.[22][16][23] Va assistir a l'escola Waterkloof abans de graduar-se a l'Institut de Nois de Pretòria.[24] 
Tot i que el seu pare va insistir perquè assistís a la universitat a Pretòria, Musk va decidir anar als Estats Units.[25] Conscient el seria més fàcil d'entrar als Estats Units des del Canadà, va sol·licitar un passaport canadenc a través de la seva mare, nascuda allà.[26][27][28] 
Mentre esperava la documentació canadenca, Musk va assistir a la Universitat de Pretòria durant cinc mesos. Així va evitar haver de fer el servei militar a sud-Àfrica.[29] El juny de 1989 va arribar a Canadà, però no va aconseguir posar-se en contacte amb el seu familiar a Montreal, així que va viure en un hostal. Aleshores va viatjar cap a l'oest per tal de viure amb un cosí llunyà a Saskatchewan.[30] Va residir allà durant un any, treballant en feines esporàdiques com ara en una granja o en un molí.[31] L'any 1990, Musk va entrar a la Universitat de Queen's, a Kingston, Ontario.[32][33] Dos anys més tard, va traslladar-se a la Universitat de Pennsilvània on l'any 1997 es va graduar en econòmiques i física.[34][35][36] 
L'any 1994, Musk va fer dues èpoques de pràctiques a Silicon Valley: en una empresa d'emmagatzematge d'energia anomenada Pinnacle Research Institute, que investigava supercondensadors per a emmagatzematge d'energia, i a l'empresa de Palo Alto Rocket Science Games.[37] Bruce Leak, antic enginyer en cap de QuickTime per a Apple que havia contractat Musk, va assegurar: ""tenia energia il·limitada. Els joves d'avui en dia no tenen ni idea de com funciona el maquinari, però ell tenia un passat com a modificador de programes d'ordinador i no li feia por de trobar solucions a problemes.""[38] L'any 1995, Musk va ser acceptat per a un doctorat en ciències dels materials i física d'energia a la Universitat d'Stanford, a Califòrnia.[39] Musk va intentar trobar feina dins de Netscape però mai va rebre resposta a les seves sol·licituds de feina.[27] En dos dies, va deixar Stanford, decidint en comptes d'això unir-se a la bombolla puntcom i llançar una empresa d'internet.[40] 
L'any 1995 va fundar, juntament amb el seu germà Kimbal i Greg Kouri l'empresa de programari Zip2, amb finançament d'un grup d'àngels inversors.[16] Van situar l'empresa en una petita oficina de lloguer a Palo Alto.[41] La companyia va desenvolupar i publicitar una guia de la ciutat a internet amb mapes, adreces i pàgines grogues.[42] Musk no es podia permetre el lloguer d’un apartament, així que dormia a l’oficina i es dutxava al gimnàs. A més, només tenien un ordinador, així que durant les hores del dia actuava com a servidor i a la nit Musk el feia servir per programar els canvis.[41] 
Els seus esforços van tenir recompensa quan van aconseguir un contracte amb The New York Times i el Chicago Tribune.[43] Compaq va comprar Zip2 el febrer de 1999 per 307 milions de dòlars, dels quals 22 milions van ser per a Musk, atès que tenia un 7 per cent de la companyia.[43][44] 
El març de 1999, Musk va cofundar X.com, una empresa de serveis financers en línia amb 10 dels milions que havia obtingut per la venta de Zip2.[43][45] Un any més tard, l'empresa es va fusionar amb Confinity,[41][46] que tenia un servei de transferència de diners anomenat PayPal.[43] La nova empresa es va enfocar en aquest servei i va passar a anomenar-se PayPal l’any 2001.[47] Musk va haver d’abandonar la seva posició com a director general degut a desavinences amb els executius.[48] L’octubre de l’any 2002, PayPal va ser adquirit per eBay per 1.500 milions en accions, dels quals Musk va rebre 165 milions.[49] Abans de la venda, Elon Musk n’era el principal accionista, amb un 11.7% del total.[50] 
L'any 2017, Musk va recomprar el domini X.com a PayPal per una quantitat que no es va fer pública. Segons ell, el domini tenia valor sentimental per a ell.[51][52] 
L'any 2001, Musk va concebre Mars Oasis, una idea d'hivernacle en miniatura que permetria fer créixer collites a Mart i va tornar a despertar l'interès del públic per l'exploració espacial.[53][54] A l'octubre del 2001, Musk va anar a Moscou per tal de comprar uns míssils balístics intercontinentals Dnepr reacondicionats, que podrien enviar els hivernacles a l'espai. Es va trobar amb empreses com ara NPO Lavochkin i Kosmotras; tanmateix, el van considerar un inexpert. El grup va tornar als Estats Units sense èxit. El febrer de 2002, van tornar a Rússia buscant tres míssils. Es van trobar de nou amb Kosmotras i els va oferir un coet per 8 milions de dòlars, però no el van acceptar. En comptes d'això, Musk va decidir començar una empresa que pogués construir coets.[55] Amb 100 milions de dòlars,[56] el maig de 2002 Musk va fundar Space Exploration Technologies Corp., conegut amb el nom comercial d' SpaceX[57] 
L'any 2006, la NASA va anunciar que SpaceX era una de les dues seleccionades per tal de fer el transport dels tripulants i la càrrega de l'Estació Espacial Internacional (ISS, per les seves sigles en anglès).[58] El 23 de desembre de 2008 van signar un contracte de 1.600 milions de dòlars 12 vols cap a la ISS amb les naus Falcon 9 i Dragon, per tal de substituir el Transbordador espacial, que seria retirat l'any 2011.[59] El 25 de maig de 2012 el vehicle Dragon d'SpaceX es va convertir en la primera nau d'una empresa no estatal en ser llançada i enganxar-se amb l'ISS.[60] 
A partir de l'any 2011, SpaceX va començar a rebre finançament del programa de la NASA per tal de desenvolupar la càpsula Dragon 2, sota el Programa de Desenvolupament de Tripulació[61] L'empresa també va rebre un contracte per tal de fer el transport dels tripulants cap a la ISS l'any 2014.[62][63] El desembre de l'any 2015, SpaceX va aconseguir aterrar per primera vegada la primera etapa del seu Falcon 9 a la Terra, dins el seu objectiu de fabricar coets reutilitzables.[64] Amb el temps, aquests aterratges es van començar a dur a terme dins el port espacial autònom, una plataforma de recuperació dins l'oceà.[65] A partir de l'any 2017, els motors van començar a ser reutilitzats en missions successives.[66] El febrer de l'any 2018, SpaceX va llançar el Falcon Heavy, el coet operatiu més potent.[67] La missió inaugural transportava un Tesla Roadster que pertanyia a Musk, a mode de model aeroespacial.[68][69] 
El 2015, SpaceX va començar a desenvolupar Starlink, una constel·lació de satèl·lits de baixa òrbita per proporcionar accés d'Internet per satèl·lit, i els dos primers prototips van ser llançats el febrer de 2018. Un segon conjunt de satèl·lits de prova i el primer desplegament d'una part de la constel·lació es va donar el maig del 2019, quan el primers 60 satèl·lits operatius van ser llançats.[70][71] El cost total del projecte per dissenyar i desplegar la constel·lació es calcula que serà d'uns 10.000 milions de dòlars, incloent gairebé 900 milions en subvencions de la Comissió de Comunicacions Federals.[72][73][74] 
A finals de l'any 2017, SpaceX va mostrar el seu vehicle de nova generació, el Big Falcon Rocket (BFR)En tardà 2017, SpaceX descobert el disseny pel seu vehicle de llançament de generació pròxima i sistema d'aeronau, Coet de Falcó Gran (BFR), que donaria suport com a proveïdor de servei de llançament a un gran rang de vehicles: òrbita terrestre, òrbita llunar, missions interplanetàries i fins i tot transport de passatger intercontinental a la Terra, pensat per a substituir, doncs, els anteriors models de l'empresa al llarg dels anys 20.[75] L'any 2018, SpaceX va anunciar una missió de circumnavegació llunar, un vol privat anomenat Projecte dearMoon.[76] 
El maig de l'any 2020, SpaceX va llançar el seu primer vol tripulat, el Demo-2, esdevenint la primera empresa privada en col·locar una persona en òrbita i en atracar una nau a l'ISS.[77] 
Tesla, Inc. (al principi Tesla Motors) va ser fundada el juliol 2003 per Martin Eberhard i Marc Tarpenning, que van llançar una ronda de finançament.[78] Ambdós homes van tenir funcions actives en el desenvolupament primerenc de l'empresa abans de l'arribada de Musk.[79] Musk va dirigir la ronda de finançament de l'any 2004, entrant a l'empresa com a directiu.[80][81][82] Musk va agafar una funció activa dins l'empresa i va supervisar el disseny del Roadster, si bé no es va implicar en el dia a dia de l'empresa.[83] Després de la crisi financera global del 2008, Eberhard va sortir de l'empresa.[84][85] Musk va esdevenir el director general i arquitecte de producte l'any 2008, càrrecs que encara ocupa avui en dia. Des de l'any 2019, Musk ha esdevingut el director general més longeu de qualsevol empresa automotriu.[86] 
Tesla va començar un cotxe esportiu elèctric, el Tesla Roadster, l'any 2008. Amb unes vendes d'aproximadament 2,500 vehicles, es va convertir en el primer cotxe totalment elèctric amb bateries de ió-liti en ser produït en sèrie.[87] L'any 2012, Tesla va començar a entregar el seu sedan de quatre portes Model S; el crossover Model X va ser llançat l'any 2015.[88][89] Un sedan orientat al públic general, el Model 3 va començar a vendre's l'any 2017.[90][91] Es tracta de cotxe elèctric més venut del món, amb més de 500.000 unitats venudes.[92] El Cybertruck, una camioneta elèctrica, va ser mostrada l'any 2019.[93][94] Amb Musk, Tesla també ha construit vàries fàbriques de muntatge de bateries, com Gigafactory 1, a Nevada i Gigafactory 3 a la Xina.[95][96][97] 
L'estiu de l'any 2020, Tesla es va convertir en el fabricant de cotxes més valuós del món.[98][99] 
Musk va proveir la idea inicial i el finançament per a SolarCity, cofundat amb els seus cosins Lyndon i Peter Rive l'any 2006.[100][101] L'any 2013, SolarCity ja era el segon proveïdor de sistemes d'energia solar dels Estats Units.[102] L'any 2014, Musk es va comprometre a construir una planta de SolarCity a Buffalo, Nova York, la planta solar més gran dels Estats Units.[103] La construcció va començar l'any 2014 i va acabar el 2017.[104] Va ser operat conjuntament amb Panasonic fins a principis de l'any 2020.[105] 
Tesla va adquirir SolarCity per més de 2.000 milions de dòlars l'any 2016 i el va convertir en la seva divisió solar; l'anunci de l'adquisició va comportar una caiguda del 10% en el preu de les accions de Tesla, ja que aleshores SolarCity s'estava enfrontant a problemes de liquiditat dels quals els accionistes de Tesla no van ser informats. Degut a això, es van emprendre accions legals contra Musk i SolarCity, ja que consideraven que la compra només es va dur a terme per a benefici de Musk.[106][107] El juny de 2019, Musk va reconèixer en els tribunals que havia reempleat tots els treballadors de SolarCity no essencials en la producció del Model 3. El tribunal també ha demostrat que Musk coneixia els problemes de l'empresa.[108] 
L'any 2016, Musk va cofundar Neuralink, una empresa de neurotecnologia que té com a objectiu la integració el cervell humà amb intel·ligència artificial. L'empresa se centra en la creació de dispositius implantats dins el cervell, amb l'objectiu final d'ajudar l'ésser humà a unir-se amb programari i poder així seguir el pas als avenços en intel·ligència artificial. Aquestes millores podrien millorar la memòria o permetre un ús més directe dels dispositius informàtics.[109][110] 
Durant una presentació en directe l'agost del 2020, Musk va descriure un dels dispositius primerencs com una mena de ""Fitbit per al crani"" que podria, en breu, curar la paràlisis, la ceguesa i la sordesa, entre d'altres. Molts neurocientífics i publicacions han criticat aquestes afirmacions.;[111][112] Ha estat considerat com a ""altament especulatiu"" i ""espectackle neurocientífic"".[113] 
L'any 2016, Musk va fundar The Boring Company (TBC), centrada en la construcció de túnels.[114] A principis de l'any següent, van començar les negociacions amb les agències reguladores i es va començar la construcció d'un túnel de proves, amb unes dimensions de 9.1m d'ample, 15m de llarg i 4.6 metres de profunditat. Com que es va dur a terme a les instal·lacions d' SpaceX, no requeria permisos[115][116][117] A principis de l'any 2020 es va finalitzar la construcció d'un túnel sota el Convention Center de Las Vegas.[118] 
Com a campanya publicitària, The Boring Company va vendre, l'any 2018, 2.000 llançaflames.[119][120] La idea se li va acudir a Musk inspirat per la pel·lícula Spaceballs de Mel Brooks, una de les seves favorites.[121][122] 
Musk és un usuari actiu de la plataforma de mitjans socials Twitter, on té més de 80 milions de seguidors.[123] Musk va fer el primer tuit al seu compte personal el juny de 2010.[124][125] Publica mems, promociona els seus interessos empresarials i de vegades comenta temes polítics i culturals d'actualitat.[126] 
Musk va piular ja el 2017 expressant el seu interès a comprar la plataforma.[127] El 31 de gener de 2022, Musk va començar a comprar de forma constant quantitats significatives d'accions de la companyia, aconseguint una participació del 5% en l'empresa el 14 de març de 2022.[128] Musk va assolir un total de 73.115.038 accions l'1 d'abril, el 9,13% del total d'accions de Twitter, valorades en aquell moment en 2.640 milions de dòlars, fet que el va convertir en el accionista més gran de la companyia. Musk no va presentar la documentació per notificar a la SEC en el termini de 10 dies des que la seva participació a l'empresa va superar el 5%, fet que suposa una violació de les lleis de valors dels EUA.[129] Quan Musk va revelar públicament la seva inversió en un document 13G a la Comissió de Valors i Borsa el 4 d'abril de 2022, les accions de Twitter van experimentar la pujada més gran en un dia des de la sortida a borsa el 2013, ja que una onada d'activitat comercial va fer que el preu de l'acció augmentés fins a un 27%.[123] La revelació que Musk havia adquirit una participació significativa a Twitter es va produir després dels tuits de Musk del 25 i 26 de març en què qüestionava el compromís de Twitter amb la llibertat d'expressió[130] i deia que estava considerant desenvolupar un lloc de mitjans socials rival,[131][132][133] encara que els comentaris es van fer després que ja hagués adquirit el 7,5% de la companyia.[128][134] 
El 4 d'abril, Musk va acceptar un acord pel qual se'l nomenaria membre del consell d'administració de Twitter i se li prohibiria adquirir més del 14,9% de la companyia,[135][136] però Musk va decidir no unir-se al consell abans que el seu nomenament es fes efectiu el 9 d'abril.[137] El 13 d'abril, Musk va fer una oferta de compra de Twitter per valor de 43.000 milions de dòlars i va llançar una OPA per comprar el 100% de les accions de Twitter a 54,20 dòlars per acció. En una carta al consell d'administració de Twitter, va indicar el desig de portar l'empresa a l'esfera privada: ""[Twitter] no prosperarà ni servirà l'imperatiu social [de la llibertat d'expressió] en la seva forma actual. Twitter s'ha de transformar en una empresa privada.""[138][139][140] En resposta, el consell d'administració de Twitter va adoptar un pla de drets dels accionistes per fer molt més costós que un sol inversor posseeixi més del 15% de l'empresa sense l'aprovació del consell.[141][142] En una entrevista de TED, Musk va mostrar poc interès en la lluita contra la censura a Internet a tot el món, dient que ""Twitter ha de coincidir amb les lleis del país"". En canvi, la preocupació de Musk per la llibertat d'expressió s'ha dirigit gairebé exclusivament a les polítiques de moderació de Twitter.[143][144] 
El 20 d'abril, Musk va aconseguir finançament per valor de 46.500 milions de dòlars.[145] El finançament incloïa 12.500 milions de dòlars en préstecs contra les accions de Musk a Tesla, i 21.000 milions de dòlars en finançament de capital, com ara la venda d'accions de Tesla.[146][147] El 25 d'abril, es va informar que Twitter estava preparada per acceptar l'oferta de Musk.[148] Més tard, aquell mateix dia, Elon Musk va concloure amb èxit la seva oferta per comprar Twitter i portar a la companyia a un mercat privat per aproximadament 44.000 milions de dòlars.[149][150][151] 
Les accions de Tesla es van enfonsar en més de 125.000 milions de dòlars l'endemà com a reacció a l'acord, fent que Musk perdés al voltant de 30.000 milions de dòlars del seu patrimoni net.[152][153] 
Finalment, el dijous 27 d'octubre del 2022 Elon Musk va veure realitzada amb èxit la seva gran ambició de comprar Twitter. 
L'any 2011 Musk va tenir la idea d'un sistema de transport dins d'un tub per tal de tenir una pressió reduïda, fent servir per a tal coixins d'aire i conduït per motors d'inducció lineal i compressors d'aire. Aleshores va dedicar una dotzena d'enginyers d'SpaceX i Tesla per tal d'establir els conceptes i els dissenys inicials.[154] L'agost del 2013, Musk va fer públic el concepte, el qual va batejar amb el nom d'Hyperloop.[155] El disseny inicial va ser publicat en un ""llibre blanc"", penjat als blocs de Tesla i SpaceX.[156][157][158] Fora de l'àmbit teòric, es plantejava un concepte de sistema de transport per a tota la Badia de San Francisco amb un cost total estimat de 6.000 milions de dòlars.[159][160] La proposta, si fos tecnològicament factible als costos citats, faria d'Hyperloop, el mitjà de transport més barat per a distàncies d'aquesta llargària.[161] 
El juny de l'any 2015, Musk va anunciar una competició de disseny per a estudiants que consistia en dissenyar les càpsules per al transport d'una línia d'Hyperloop d'una milla de llargària, dins les instal·lacions d'SpaceX. La línia es va inaugurar el gener de 2017, i Musk va anunciar que l'empresa començaria un projecte de túnel amb l'aeroport de Hawthorne com a destinació.[162] El juliol de 2017, Musk va anunciar haver rebut ""autorització verbal"" per tal de construir un sistema d'Hyperloop que connectés les ciutats de Nova York i Washington DC, aturant-se a Filadèlfia i Baltimore.[163] 
Musk ha estat criticat per fer declaracions poc científiques i controvertides. El 2018, va ser demandat per la Comissió de Borsa i Valors dels Estats Units (SEC, per les seves sigles en anglès) per tuitejar falsament que havia aconseguit finançament per a una adquisició privada de Tesla. Va arribar a un acord amb la SEC però no va admetre la culpabilitat, renunciant temporalment a la seva presidència i acceptant limitacions en el seu ús de Twitter. El 2019, va guanyar un judici per difamació presentat contra ell per un espeleòleg britànic que va assessorar en el rescat de la cova de Tham Luang. Musk també ha estat criticat per difondre informació errònia sobre la pandèmia de COVID-19 i per les seves altres opinions sobre assumptes com la intel·ligència artificial, les criptomonedes i el transport públic. En tot cas s'ha abanderat de ser un amant absolut de la llibertat d'expressió, fins al punt de ser conegut popularment com a ""absolutista del lliure discurs"". 
Precisament per aquest motiu s'ha engrandit la controvèrsia per la seva adquisició de la xarxa social Twitter a octubre de 2022. Com s'ha explicat amb anterioritat en aquest article, l'adquisició ha format part d'un procés molt llarg de guerra verbal i ha estat molt cobert mediàticament. Les preocupacions actuals rauen en les seves intencions declarades de fer d'aquesta plataforma un nou univers de la llibertat d'expressió absoluta. 
Musk va ser escollit membre de la Royal Society el 2018.[164] El 2015, va rebre un doctorat honorari en enginyeria i tecnologia a Yale[165] i membre honorari de l'IEEE.[166] Els premis per les seves contribucions al desenvolupament dels coets Falcon inclouen el George Low Transportation Award de l'Institut Americà d'Aeronàutica el 2008,[167] la Medalla d'Or de l'Espai de la Fédération Aéronautique Internationale el 2010[168] i la Medalla d'Or de la Royal Aeronautical Society a 2012.[169] Va ser inclòs entre les 100 persones més influents de la revista Time el 2010,[170] 2013,[171] 2018,[172] i 2021.[173] El 2021, Musk va ser seleccionat com a ""Persona de l'any"" de la revista Time. L'editor en cap de Time, Edward Felsenthal, va escriure que ""la Persona de l'Any és un marcador d'influència, i pocs individus han tingut més influència que Musk sobre la vida a la Terra, i potencialment també sobre la vida fora de la Terra"".[174][175] 
Musk va guanyar 175,8 milions de dòlars quan PayPal es va vendre a eBay el 2002.[176] Va aparèixer per primera vegada a la llista de multimilionaris de Forbes el 2012, amb un patrimoni net de 2.000 milions de dòlars.[177] 
A principis del 2020, Musk comptava amb un patrimoni net de 27.000 milions de dòlars.[178] A finals d'any, el seu patrimoni net havia augmentat en 150.000 milions de dòlars, principalment pel fet que posseïa al voltant del 20% de les accions de Tesla.[179] Per exemple, va caure 16.300 milions de dòlars al setembre, la caiguda més gran en un sol dia en la història de l'Índex de Multimilionaris de Bloomberg.[180] El novembre d'aquell any, Musk va superar el cofundador de Facebook Mark Zuckerberg per convertir-se en la tercera persona més rica del món; una setmana més tard va superar el cofundador de Microsoft Bill Gates per convertir-se en el segon més ric.[181] El gener del 2021, Musk, amb un patrimoni net de 185.000 milions de dòlars, va superar el fundador d'Amazon Jeff Bezos per convertir-se en la persona més rica del món.[182] El 27 de setembre de 2021, després que les accions de Tesla pugessin, Forbes va anunciar que Musk tenia un patrimoni net de més de 200.000 milions de dòlars i era la persona més rica del món.[182] Al novembre de 2021, Musk es va convertir en la primera persona amb un patrimoni net de més de 300.000 milions de dòlars.[183] El 30 de desembre de 2022, es va informar que Musk havia perdut 200.000 milions de dòlars del seu patrimoni net a causa de la caiguda del valor de les accions de Tesla, convertint-se en la primera persona en la història a perdre una suma tan gran de diners.[184][185] 
Al voltant del 75% de la riquesa de Musk procedia d'accions de Tesla el novembre del 2020,[181] una proporció que es va reduir al voltant del 37% el desembre del 2022, després de vendre gairebé 40.000 milions de dòlars en accions de la companyia des de finals de 2021.[186] Musk no rep un salari de Tesla; va acordar amb el consell el 2018 un pla de compensació que vincula els seus guanys personals a la valoració i els ingressos de Tesla.[179] L'acord estipulava que Musk només rebria la compensació si Tesla aconseguia certs valors de mercat.[187] Va ser l'acord més gran d'aquest tipus mai realitzat entre un executiu en cap i la junta d'una empresa.[188] A la primera recompensa, atorgada el maig del 2020, tenia dret a comprar 1,69 milions d'accions de Tesla (al voltant de l'1% de la companyia) a preus per sota del mercat, cosa que valia al voltant de 800 milions de dòlars.[188][187]

""One of the biggest risks to the future of civilization is AI,"" Musk told attendees at the World Government Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, shortly after mentioning the development of ChatGPT. ""It's both positive or negative and has great, great promise, great capability,"" Musk said. But, he stressed that ""with that comes great danger."" The Tesla, SpaceX and Twitter boss was asked about how he sees technology developing 10 years from now. Musk is co-founder of OpenAI, the U.S. startup that developed ChatGPT — a so-called generative AI tool which returns human-like responses to user prompts. ChatGPT is an advanced form of AI powered by a large language model called GPT-3. It is programmed to understand human language and generate responses based on huge bodies of data. ChatGPT ""has illustrated to people just how advanced AI has become,"" according to Musk. ""The AI has been advanced for a while. It just didn't have a user interface that was accessible to most people."" Whereas cars, airplanes and medicine must abide by regulatory safety standards, AI does not yet have any rules or regulations keeping its development under control, he added. ""I think we need to regulate AI safety, frankly,"" Musk said. ""It is, I think, actually a bigger risk to society than cars or planes or medicine."" Regulation ""may slow down AI a little bit, but I think that that might also be a good thing,"" Musk added. The billionaire has long warned of the perils of unfettered AI development. He once said artificial intelligence is ""far more dangerous"" than nuclear warheads. His words have more gravity today, as the rise of ChatGPT threatens to upend the job market with more advanced, human-like writing. Musk left OpenAI's board in 2018 and no longer holds a stake in the company. ""Initially it was created as an open-source nonprofit. Now it is closed-source and for profit. I don't have an open stake in OpenAI, nor am I on the board, nor do I control it in any way."" Part of the reason for Musk's decision to establish OpenAI was because ""Google was not paying enough attention to AI safety,"" he said. ChatGPT has led to a heated battle between Google, a titan of internet search, and Microsoft, which has invested in OpenAI and integrated its software into its Bing web browser. Google fired back at ChatGPT with its own rival tool, called Bard. The company is playing catch-up, as investors question whether ChatGPT will pose a threat to its dominance in web search.

This story is based on interviews with people familiar with the ...","This story is based on interviews with people familiar with the events involved and supported by documents obtained by Platformer. At 2:36 on Monday morning, James Musk sent an urgent message to Twitter engineers.  “We are debugging an issue with engagement across the platform,” wrote Musk, a cousin of the Twitter CEO, tagging “@here” in Slack to ensure that anyone online would see it. “Any people who can make dashboards and write software please can you help solve this problem. This is high urgency. If you are willing to help out please thumbs up this post.” When bleary-eyed engineers began to log on to their laptops, the nature of the emergency became clear: Elon Musk’s tweet about the Super Bowl got less engagement than President Joe Biden’s. Biden’s tweet, in which he said he would be supporting his wife in rooting for the Philadelphia Eagles, generated nearly 29 million impressions. Musk, who also tweeted his support for the Eagles, generated a little more than 9.1 million impressions before deleting the tweet in apparent frustration. In the wake of those losses — the Eagles to the Kansas City Chiefs, and Musk to the president of the United States — Twitter’s CEO flew his private jet back to the Bay Area on Sunday night to demand answers from his team. Within a day, the consequences of that meeting would reverberate around the world, as Twitter users opened the app to find that Musk’s posts overwhelmed their ranked timeline. This was no accident, Platformer can confirm: after Musk threatened to fire his remaining engineers, they built a system designed to ensure that Musk — and Musk alone — benefits from previously unheard-of promotion of his tweets to the entire user base.  In recent weeks, Musk has been obsessed with the amount of engagement his posts are receiving. Last week, Platformer broke the news that he fired one of two remaining principal engineers at the company after the engineer told him that views on his tweets are declining in part because interest in Musk has declined in general. His deputies told the rest of the engineering team this weekend that if the engagement issue wasn’t “fixed,” they would all lose their jobs as well.  Late Sunday night, Musk addressed his team in-person. Roughly 80 people were pulled in to work on the project, which had quickly become priority number one at the company. Employees worked through the night investigating various hypotheses about why Musk’s tweets weren’t reaching as many people as he thought they should and testing out possible solutions. One possibility, engineers said, was that Musk’s reach might have been reduced because he’d been blocked and muted by so many people in recent months. Even before the events of this weekend, Musk’s long stint as Twitter’s main character, both in the run-up to and aftermath of his $44 billion takeover of the company, had led huge numbers of people to filter him out of their feeds.  But there were also legitimate technical reasons the CEO’s tweets weren’t performing. Twitter’s system has historically promoted tweets from users whose posts perform better to both followers and non-followers in the For You Tab; Musk’s tweets should have fit that model but showed up less only about half the time that some engineers thought they should, according to some internal estimates.  By Monday afternoon, “the problem” had been “fixed.” Twitter deployed code to automatically “greenlight” all of Musk’s tweets, meaning his tweets will bypass Twitter’s filters designed to show people the best content possible. The algorithm now artificially boosted Musk’s tweets by a factor of 1,000 – a constant score that ensured his tweets rank higher than anyone else’s in the feed.  Internally, this is called a “power user multiplier,” although it only applies to Elon Musk, we’re told. The code also allows Musk’s account to bypass Twitter heuristics that would otherwise prevent a single account from flooding the core ranked feed, now known as “For You.” That explains why people opening the app Monday found that Musk dominated the feed, with a dozen or more Musk tweets and replies visible to anyone who followed him and millions more who did not. Over 90 percent of Musk’s followers now see his tweets, according to one internal estimate.  Musk acknowledged his bombardment of the timeline on Tuesday afternoon, posting a version of the popular “forced to drink milk” meme in which one woman labeled “Elon’s tweets” forcibly bottle-feeds another woman labeled “Twitter” while pulling her hair back.  Some of his tweets Monday were sent while he was on calls with Twitter engineers, to test out whether the solutions they’d designed were working as well as he thought they should. After Musk’s timeline takeover caused an uproar Monday, he seemed to suggest that the changes would be walked back, at least in part. “Please stay tuned while we make adjustments to the uh .… “algorithm,” he tweeted.  The artificial boosts applied to his account remain in place, although the factor is now lower than 1,000, we’re told. Musk’s handful of tweets Tuesday reported around 43 million impressions, which are on the high end of his recent average. Absurd as Musk’s antics are, they do highlight a tension familiar to almost anyone who has ever used a social network: why are some posts more popular than others? Why am I seeing this thing, and not that one?  Engineers for services like TikTok and Instagram can offer partial, high-level answers to these questions. But ranking algorithms make predictions based on hundreds or thousands of signals, and deliver posts to millions of users, making it almost impossible for anyone to say with any degree of accuracy who sees what. For better and for worse, that answer hasn’t been good enough for Musk. As Twitter’s most prominent user, with nearly 129 million followers, his posts often get 10 million or more impressions, as counted by Twitter. (There are good reasons to doubt the accuracy of these counts, but better data is not readily available.) But Musk’s view counts still fluctuate widely. The bottle-feeding tweet got a reported 118.4 million impressions; his next one, a joke observation previously posted to Reddit and satirically attributed to Abraham Lincoln, got 49.9 million. Some of his tweets from earlier this month had fewer than 8 million.  The most obvious reason for this discrepancy is that people think some tweets are better than others. But it doesn’t have to work like that: you could also change the ranking algorithms so that they show your posts no matter what.  Terrified of losing their jobs, this is the system that Twitter engineers are now building.   “He bought the company, made a point of showcasing what he believed was broken and manipulated under previous management, then turns around and manipulates the platform to force engagement on all users to hear only his voice,” said a current employee. “I think we’re past the point of believing that he actually wants what’s best for everyone here.” US regulators are taking a harder line on crypto and pushing banks to pull back on their crypto relationships in the wake of FTX’s collapse.

Last week, the Twitter CEO took his Twitter account private for a day to test whether that might boost the size of his audience. The move came after several prominent right-wing accounts that Musk interacts with complained that recent changes to Twitter had reduced their reach. On Tuesday, Musk gathered a group of engineers and advisors into a room at Twitter’s headquarters looking for answers. Why are his engagement numbers tanking? “This is ridiculous,” he said, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the meeting. “I have more than 100 million followers, and I’m only getting tens of thousands of impressions.” One of the company’s two remaining principal engineers offered a possible explanation for Musk’s declining reach: just under a year after the Tesla CEO made his surprise offer to buy Twitter for $44 billion, public interest in his antics is waning.   Employees showed Musk internal data regarding engagement with his account, along with a Google Trends chart. Last April, they told him, Musk was at “peak” popularity in search rankings, indicated by a score of “100.” Today, he’s at a score of nine. Engineers had previously investigated whether Musk’s reach had somehow been artificially restricted, but found no evidence that the algorithm was biased against him. Musk did not take the news well.  “You’re fired, you’re fired,” Musk told the engineer. (Platformer is withholding the engineer’s name in light of the harassment Musk has directed at former Twitter employees.) Dissatisfied with engineers’ work so far, Musk has instructed employees to track how many times each of his tweets are recommended, according to one current worker. It has now been seven weeks since Twitter added public view counts for every tweet. At the time, Musk promised that the feature would give the world a better sense of how vibrant the platform is.  “Shows how much more alive Twitter is than it may seem, as over 90% of Twitter users read, but don’t tweet, reply or like, as those are public actions,” he tweeted. Almost two months later, though, view counts have had the opposite effect, emphasizing how little engagement most posts get relative to their audience size. At the same time, Twitter usage in the United States has declined almost 9 percent since Musk’s takeover, according to one recent study. Twitter sources say the view count feature itself may be contributing to the decline in engagement, and therefore views. The like and retweet buttons were made smaller to accommodate the display of views, making them harder to easily tap. An even more obvious reason for the decline in engagement is Twitter’s increasingly glitchy product, which has baffled users with its disappearing mentions, shifting algorithmic priorities, and tweets inserted seemingly at random from accounts they don’t follow. On Wednesday, the company suffered one of its first major outages since Musk took over, with users being told, inexplicably, “You are over the daily limit for sending tweets.” It turns out that an employee had inadvertently deleted data for an internal service that sets rate limits for using Twitter. The team that worked on that service left the company in November. “As the adage goes, ‘you ship your org chart,’” said one current employee. “It’s chaos here right now, so we’re shipping chaos.” Interviews with current Twitter employees paint a picture of a deeply troubled workplace, where Musk’s whim-based approach to product management leaves workers scrambling to implement new features even as the core service falls apart. The disarray makes it less likely that Musk will ever recoup the $44 billion he spent to buy Twitter, and may hasten its decline into insolvency.  “We haven’t seen much in the way of longer term, cogent strategy,” one employee said. “Most of our time is dedicated to three main areas: putting out fires (mostly caused by firing the wrong people and trying to recover from that), performing impossible tasks, and ‘improving efficiency’ without clear guidelines of what the expected end results are. We mostly move from dumpster fire to dumpster fire, from my perspective.” Musk’s product feedback, which comes largely from replies to his tweets, often baffles his workers.  “There’s times he’s just awake late at night and says all sorts of things that don’t make sense,” one employee said. “And then he’ll come to us and be like, ‘this one person says they can’t do this one thing on the platform,’ and then we have to run around chasing some outlier use case for one person. It doesn’t make any sense.” The San Francisco headquarters, whose landlord has sued Twitter for nonpayment of rent, has a melancholy air. When people pass each other in the halls, we’re told that the standard greeting is “where are you interviewing?” and “where do you have offers?” The 8th floor is still stocked with beds, and employees have to reserve them in advance.  “Most weeknights, they are fully booked,” another current employee said. The perks that made Twitter an attractive place to work pre-Musk have been eradicated. Food at the office? “Sucks – and now we have to pay for it. And, I know this sounds petty, but they appear to have obtained the absolute worst coffee vendors on earth.” Slack – once the epicenter of Twitter’s open culture, where employees discussed anything and everything – has gone dormant. One current employee described it as a “ghost town.”  “People don’t even chat about work things anymore,” the employee said. “It’s just heartbreaking. I have more conversations with my colleagues on Signal and WhatsApp than I do on Slack. Before the transition, it was not uncommon in the team channel to talk about what everybody did that weekend. There’s none of that anymore.”  When Musk or the goons ask questions, employees are torn between giving the right answer and the safe answer.  “When you’re asked a question, you run it through your head and say ‘what is the least fireable response I can have to this right now?’” one employee explained. (Of course, that’s not true for everyone at the company. “There are a handful of true believers that are obviously just ass-kissers and brown-nosers who are trying to take advantage of the clear vacuum that exists,” that same employee says.)  Despite the turmoil, remaining employees say that what they call “Twitter 2.0” has managed to improve on its predecessor in at least some ways.  “In the past, Twitter operated too often by committees that went nowhere,” one employee said. “I do appreciate the fact that if you want to do something that you think will improve something, you generally have license to do it. But that’s a double edged sword — moving that fast can lead to unintended consequences.”  The employee cited the disastrous relaunch of Twitter Blue, which resulted in brands being impersonated and dozens of top advertisers fleeing the platform. “If Elon can learn how to put a bit more thought into some of the decisions, and fire from the hip a bit less, it might do some good,” the employee said. “He needs to learn the areas where he just does not know things and let those that do know take over.”  At the same time, “he really doesn’t like to believe that there is anything in technology that he doesn’t know, and that’s frustrating,” the employee said. “You can’t be the smartest person in the room about everything, all the time.” With Musk continuing to fire people impulsively, entire teams have been wiped out, and their work is being handed to other, overstretched teams that often have little understanding of the new work that is being assigned to them.  “They have to become code archaeologists to dig through the repo and figure out what’s going on,” one employee said. Meanwhile, the recent wave of layoffs in the tech industry have contributed to a feeling of paralysis among those who remain at Twitter.  “I do think the recent vibe overall in tech, and fear of not being able to find something else, is the primary factor for most folks,” an employee said. “I know for a fact that most of my team is doing hardcore interview prep, and would jump at likely any opportunity to walk away.” There is also a sense of unease about how recent changes will be reviewed by regulators. As part of an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, Twitter committed to following a series of steps before pushing out changes, including creating a project proposal and conducting security and privacy reviews.  Since Musk took over, those steps have become an afterthought, employees said. “His stance is basically ‘fuck you regulators,’” we’re told.  The FTC plans to audit the company this quarter, we’re told, and employees have doubts that Twitter has the necessary documentation in place to pass inspection. “FTC compliance is concerning,” one says.  Last year, before Musk took over, the FTC fined Twitter $150 million for breaking its agreement. Another breach would almost certainly result in millions of dollars in additional fines, and a flurry of news coverage — just the thing, perhaps, to get the views on Musk’s tweets trending up again. Elsewhere in Twitter: Twitter sent EU regulators an incomplete report on how its tackling disinformation and failed to include commitments that it would empower fact-checkers. A congressional hearing on the Twitter Files offered plenty of heated exchanges but little new information. Musk reinstated the account of a Republican senator after it was blocked for a hunting photo flagged as “graphic violence.” Multiple senior employees left Twitter after their pre-takeover stock vested on February 1. Twitter rolled out its subscription service, Twitter Blue, to users in India, Brazil and Indonesia.

Nelson: No, Elon Musk has violated a lot of the social contract, and its basis of trust, with employees, with investors, suppliers, regulators, ...","Harvard Law expert says that Elon Musk and the tech industry risk gains when they engage in disreputable business practices Testifying recently at his trial for tweeting in 2018 that he had secured funding to take the electric car company Tesla private, Elon Musk suggested that people shouldn’t believe everything that he writes on the social network he now owns, telling the court that, “Just because I tweet something does not mean people believe it or will act accordingly.” Having already been fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the famous billionaire entrepreneur who also oversees SpaceX was being sued by shareholders who claim they lost billions when Tesla’s stock initially rose, then suddenly dropped when a deal failed to materialize. Although the jury ultimately did not impose liability on Musk for the tweet, questions about his business practices remain. According to business ethics expert J.S. Nelson ’01, Musk’s trial is just the latest example of how he has drawn attention for violating much of the “social contract with employees, investors, suppliers, regulators, and other parts of his ecosystem.” To learn more, Harvard Law Today recently spoke with Nelson, currently a visiting researcher at Harvard Law’s Program on Negotiation and a professor at Villanova University’s Charles Widger School of Law. She is the author, with the late Lynn Stout, of the 2022 book, “Business Ethics: What Everyone Needs to Know.” Nelson argues that Musk is beginning to pay the price in other ways for questionable business practices that have eroded trust, and she advises that, while unethical conduct can bring short-term gains, running an ethical business “pays better over the long term in dividends that are sustainable.” Harvard Law Today: What are business ethics and why do they matter? J.S. Nelson: Business ethics are how we behave in the business context, and the impacts that our behavior have on the business world around us. Behaving ethically is important to our lives, to our well-being, to society, and to how we make money. It’s not true that making money in any way, shape, or form is good. Adam Smith recognized that, for capitalism to make a society prosperous, exchanges of goods and services need to make both parties better off. If I promise to give you something in exchange for shoes, and you give me the shoes, and I run away with them — if I violate the terms of that exchange so that we’re no longer both gaining from the exchange — we don’t have a socially beneficial exchange. We’re talking about maintaining the core of how our market system works. In addition, there are massive benefits to businesses and people who behave ethically, and significant penalties in the long term against people who do not. “[T]here are massive benefits to businesses and people who behave ethically, and significant penalties in the long term against people who do not.” HLT: Is Elon Musk reaping those ethical benefits? Nelson: No, Elon Musk has violated a lot of the social contract, and its basis of trust, with employees, with investors, suppliers, regulators, and other parts of his ecosystem. He is starting to feel the repercussions of having destroyed the ethical assumptions that underlie many of those relationships. The Latin word for “trust,” for example, is the basis of our word for credit. If you do not trust someone, you do not extend credit to them on the same terms. Elon Musk is trying to renegotiate $3 billion of the high-interest-rate loans that he took out to buy Twitter. Can you imagine what terms he’s going to be offered now? Would you trust him after he’s tried to back out of that very contract? In addition, because of Musk’s actions, an estimated 83% of Twitter’s workforce has left, and the company is being sued for non-payment of rent in multiple jurisdictions. Would you be eager to work for him at a discount, or to rent office space to him for less than at a very high premium? Musk’s approach at Twitter has had terrible consequences for the company. From when he took over four months ago, merely 17% of Twitter’s workforce is still available. The company has lost 40% of its revenue, with advertisers jumping ship constantly. There is the very real possibility that it may have to file for bankruptcy soon. The trust deficit that Musk’s behavior fosters spreads across his different ventures. Part of his defense in the Tesla trial was even to tell us that we shouldn’t trust him. Musk has now broken a record for personally losing the most money of anyone in history — $182 billion since November of 2021. He doesn’t seem like a star you’d hitch your wagon to. By contrast, companies with a good ethical reputation can more easily hire employees, and they do so on better terms. Surveys show that, even during difficult economic times, 92% of employees would leave their current job to work for an employer with an excellent ethical reputation. There’s only so much high-caliber tech talent out there, and those people will have options, even amid layoffs. When Musk is hiring again, they will remember that he has a reputation for not treating his workforce well. Employees will be less likely to accept jobs at his companies, and more likely to demand monetary premiums to accept those jobs. Historically, employees are 77% less likely to take a job with an unethical company, and an unethical company has to offer employees a 57% pay premium for them to consider taking it.   “Surveys show that, even during difficult economic times, 92% of employees would leave their current job to work for an employer with an excellent ethical reputation.” HLT: Is the amount of criticism that Elon Musk and his companies receive relative to others a form of observation bias because they’re simply in the limelight more often? Nelson: I don’t think so. There are at least two reasons why this story and sector have gripped our attention. The first is that what’s going on at Tesla and Twitter, as two examples of Musk’s companies, is not the way that people at other companies are necessarily behaving or at the magnitude that other people are doing similar things. Elon Musk has already been fined over $20 million by the SEC for things that he’s tweeted and said to investors. But there’s also something to be said about why we are hearing so much about unrest in the tech sector generally. Even ahead of the rest of the economy, that sector is going through massive layoffs, which are happening because its management seems so little committed to employees. The layoffs stand in stark contrast to these companies’ recent profits. Jeff Bezos of Amazon, for example, could give roughly $110,000 to every person who works for Amazon around the world, and still retain more money than he had before the pandemic. The profits that these companies have made, especially over the last two or three years, are astonishing. But workers have not felt appreciated for contributing to company profits. Instead, there are many stories about the brutal experience of working in an Amazon warehouse and elsewhere, with employees under constant pressure to meet unrealistic performance goals, often getting injured, and ultimately feeling like robots. HLT: How does the tech industry ethos of ‘move fast and break things’ impact the way that CEOs think about business ethics? Nelson: There are a lot of innovative companies that don’t move fast and break things through not treating their employees well. You don’t want to break your people. If you make the terms of employment very mercenary, you receive mercenary behavior back. A reputation for bad ethics costs companies not only in salary, but in innovation, productivity, and turnover. Treating your people as disposable is leading to the spread of “quiet-quitting,” and other such disengaged phenomena. Only about a third of U.S. employees still report that they are actively engaged with their work — with not many differences between remote and non-remote workers. But treating people well matters, and good management increases employee engagement. Employees need to believe that the company will treat them well, and that they want to invest personally in its success. Engaged and motived employees spur innovation. Well-managed companies see that investment in their profitability numbers. Organizations with happy and engaged workers tend to be 22% more productive than organizations with lower satisfaction rates and less employee commitment. “Treating your people as disposable is leading to the spread of “quiet-quitting,” and other such disengaged phenomena.” HLT: What is the bigger impact of the ways Elon Musk and perhaps some other tech CEOs lead? Nelson: Elon Musk is a product of the system that we have created. He has been rewarded in the short term for a lot of really bad behavior, which would have greater repercussions for anybody else. That distortion sends a signal to other people to behave the way that he has. But too many people behaving that way destabilizes our system. We now realize that a purely transactional approach toward your people is dangerous for any business. Mercenary behavior and unethical conduct tend to cluster together. Ethical misconduct spreads and results in pervasive wrongdoing across organizations. Without an ethical environment, you can’t manage a company because you can trust your people to tell you the truth, and to give you the information that you need to run your organization. Poor management can also create misconduct through pushing people too hard. My research on managerial misuse of workplace surveillance systems shows what a threat, for example, they can be to business ethics and basic compliance. It’s dangerous for us and for investors to trust companies that behave unethically. Not so long ago in the 2007–2008 financial crisis, we lost 45% of the world’s wealth through mortgage fraud, among other things. These bubbles have consequences. Lies and displays of callous behavior have consequences. We, as a society, should be smarter about not allowing unethical excesses and the damage that it causes. We should even more consciously reward behavior that is more profitable for all of us in the long term. “Elon Musk is a product of the system that we have created. He has been rewarded in the short term for a lot of really bad behavior, which would have greater repercussions for anybody else.” HLT: Last question. Is the system up to it? In the recent suit brought by shareholders, Elon Musk was not found liable. And so, while he’s paid lots of fines, it is hard not to wonder if the system is strong enough to get to the place you’re talking about, where we’re not rewarding the bad behavior, and we are rewarding good behavior? And if not, what needs to change? Nelson: Engaging in business ethics and its benefits for our society cannot simply be a matter of law-enforcement cases or civil suits at the end of the line. By then, most of the damage has been done. At that point, you’re picking over the bodies, and trying to figure out how to compensate people as best you can for the harm that they allege they have already incurred. It’s particularly perverse for someone like Musk who lies to be able to say that he should escape liability because he lies so much. We need our culture and institutions to focus on encouraging and rewarding ethical behavior for market transactions to be mutually beneficial. And we do see that. There is a positive story here. The data show that you shouldn’t be a jerk to get ahead. We, as human beings, tend to reward pro-social behavior over the long term, and in normal conditions, we shun those who engage in behavior that is damaging to the rest of us. Being ethical pays, and it pays better over the long term in dividends that are sustainable. It may be less flashy, but you’re more likely to live a good life, to provide for the people around you, to build something that you are proud of, including a company that is solid, that contributes the goods and services that people need, and that adds value. It was Adam Smith’s great insight that the ethically bargained-for exchange would make both parties better off. An ethical exchange grows the pie for everyone. So, let’s get back to that. Let’s get back to Adam Smith and preserve the good things that capitalism can do when we keep healthy the core of business ethics upon which it depends.

NTB/Carina Johansen via REUTERS  Acquire Licensing Rights DETROIT, March 1 (Reuters) - Elon Musk has clashed often with securities regulators and highway safety authorities, but there's one area the Tesla and Twitter chief says the government should regulate now: Artificial Intelligence. ""AI stresses me out,"" Musk said near the end of a more than three-hour presentation to Tesla investors about company plans. Tesla's own ambitious artificial intelligence efforts had a featured role in the presentation of Musk's ""Master Plan 3"", the third part of a series of papers on how to expand Tesla and convert the world to clean energy. There was a video of a Optimus humanoid robot, being developed by Tesla, manipulating parts of other Optimus robots as if it intended to assemble replicas of itself. Executives gave detailed presentations about how Tesla is using artificial intelligence technology to train vehicles to drive themselves - an effort under scrutiny by federal and state authorities. But when asked by an analyst if AI could help Tesla build cars, Musk took a less optimistic line. ""I don't see AI helping us make cars any time soon,"" he said. ""At that point ... there's no point in any of us working."" Earlier this week, Musk appeared to confirm via Twitter reports that he is recruiting a team of AI technologists to build a competitor to OpenAI's text-based ChatGPT, backed by Microsoft Corp, (MSFT.O) and similar systems under development at Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and other large technology platforms. Musk tweeted last December that ChatGPT, a text-based chatbot developed by OpenAI that can draft prose, poetry or even computer code on command, ""is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI."" He amplified those concerns for the audience of Tesla analysts Wednesday. ""I'm a little worried about the AI stuff,"" Musk said from a stage where he was flanked by 16 Tesla executives, including Autopilot head. ""We need some kind of, like, regulatory authority or something overseeing AI development,"" Musk said. ""Make sure it's operating in the public interest. It's quite dangerous technology. I fear I may have done some things to accelerate it."" Tesla's effort to enable its cars to drive themselves safely is ""obviously useful"" AI, Musk said. ""I don't know. Tesla is doing good things in AI,"" he said. Musk paused, then sighed. ""This one stresses me out. I don't know what to say about it.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64520157,Elon Musk found not guilty of fraud over Tesla tweet - BBC News,20230201,"Feb 4, 2023 ... The Tesla boss is cleared of fraud charges over a tweet about taking the carmaker back into private ownership.","Tesla's Elon Musk has been cleared of wrongdoing for a tweet in which he said he had ""funding secured"" to take the electric carmaker back into private ownership. Shareholders argued he misled them with his posts in August 2018, and they had lost billions of dollars because of them. The proposed $72bn (£60bn) buyout never materialised. If found liable, Musk could have been ordered to pay out billions in damages. It took the nine jurors less than two hours to reach their verdict on the class-action lawsuit on Friday afternoon.  Mr Musk - who had wanted the trial moved to Texas, where Tesla is based, arguing he could not get a fair trial in San Francisco - welcomed the outcome. Taking to Twitter, the social media platform he bought for $44bn last October, he posted: ""Thank goodness, the wisdom of the people has prevailed! ""I am deeply appreciative of the jury's unanimous finding of innocence in the Tesla 420 take-private case."" Central to the lawsuit was Mr Musk's tweet on 7 August 2018: ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."" The plaintiffs also argued Mr Musk had lied when he tweeted later in the day that ""investor support is confirmed"". The stock price surged after the tweets, but fell back again within days as it became clear the deal would not go through. According to an economist hired by the shareholders, investor losses were calculated as high as $12bn, after many made decisions about buying and selling their shares based on the tweet.   The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Mr Musk over his tweets, accusing him of lying to investors. Mr Musk agreed to step aside as Tesla board chairman and settled for $20m. During the three-week trial, Mr Musk - who also leads SpaceX and Twitter - had argued he thought he had a verbal commitment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund for the deal. During his nearly nine hours on the witness stand, the world's second-richest man said: ""Just because I tweet something does not mean people believe it or will act accordingly."" Shareholders had argued that ""funding secured"" suggested more than a verbal agreement.  Although Tesla's share price shot up after the tweet was posted, Mr Musk also questioned whether his tweets had any effect on Tesla's share price.  ""At one point I tweeted that I thought that, in my opinion, the stock price was too high... and it went higher, which is counterintuitive,"" he said - arguing the effect his tweets have on the stock price can be unpredictable.  Mr Musk said he eventually scrapped the plan to take Tesla private after his discussions with smaller investors led him to believe they would prefer that the firm remain publicly traded. He was not in court when the verdict was read, but he was present during closing arguments earlier on Friday as duelling portraits were drawn of him by the rival legal teams. Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer for the Tesla shareholders, said: ""Our society is based on rules. We need rules to save us from anarchy. Rules should apply to Elon Musk like everyone else."" Mr Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, said: ""Just because it's a bad tweet doesn't make it a fraud."" After the verdict, Mr Porritt said: ""We are disappointed with the verdict and are considering next steps."" Mr Musk was generally calm during his testimony - though at times he appeared annoyed at the line of questioning.  There were also times of levity. After a lawyer representing shareholders accidentally called Elon Musk ""Mr Tweet"", Elon Musk promptly changed his name on Twitter to the same moniker.  Several Tesla directors also testified, including James Murdoch, son of Rupert Murdoch. They testified that Mr Musk did not need the Tesla board to review buyout tweets.  Securities fraud lawyer Reed Kathrein called the tweet about taking Tesla private ""as concrete a statement of taking a company private as there can be"", and said the not guilty verdict was ""a travesty to investors and the securities laws"".

							  Jemima Kelly  Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. If Elon Musk is right about Twitter being crucial to the future of civilisation, then things are looking bleak for us all. Outages are on the rise, advertising revenues have plunged, and a company that had a 7,500-strong workforce just four months ago now employs just 2,000, after yet another round of job cuts. When Musk took over the social media platform back in October, the sometimes-richest person in the world said he was doing so not to make money, but to “try to help humanity”. He was determined to make Twitter better, he said, because it was “important to the future of civilisation to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner”.  I haven’t seen Musk take part in many serious debates of late — healthy or otherwise — though I have seen him posting a whole load of third-rate memes and re-sharing his own bad gags. I do wonder, also, whether someone who is reported to have got 80 engineers to tweak the algorithm so his tweets would be more visible than those of the US president is really the person who will manage to save Twitter and (according to him) the rest of us.  In some ways, though, all of that is beside the point. I never expected Musk, when he took over Twitter, to suddenly resist the urge to make dumb jokes, nor to stop spouting unfounded claims to his 130mn followers in an irresponsible fashion, nor to refrain from using the platform for his own personal gain. Nor did I expect him to be able — or even willing — to allow unfettered free speech on the platform.  Furthermore, Twitter is more like some kind of ghastly open-mic night than a “digital town square”, so the idea that Musk could somehow use it to bring us all together always seemed rather far-fetched to me. What I really expected was that Twitter would simply carry on being just as bad, and just as good, as it had been before Musk took over.  But in the four months since the takeover, Twitter has felt like it has got decidedly worse. It’s not so much, for me at least, that the content has become more offensive, or more aggressive, or more fake. It’s not even about the regular technical glitches — like the broken timeline many users found when they visited the site on Wednesday. It just somehow feels like a less exciting place than it used to be; it just feels a bit . . . boring.  In an attempt to get a sense of whether this view was held more widely, this week I ran a Twitter poll to get a sense of how people felt that the platform had — or hadn’t — changed in the four months since Musk had bought it. I gave four possible answers (which admittedly might have been skewed slightly negative), guided by what I had seen and heard people say about it already: “It’s so, so much worse”; “It’s marginally worse”; “Better! Free speech baby!” and, finally, “Don’t notice a difference”.  After 24 hours, the results were in. Out of more than 2,000 people who voted, only 6 per cent said Twitter had got better since Musk’s takeover, with just over 17 per cent saying they hadn’t noticed any difference. That meant that more than three-quarters of respondents felt it had deteriorated: 31 per cent went for “so, so much worse”, and the biggest group, 46 per cent, said Twitter had got marginally worse. This is my experience too. Twitter is becoming a less interesting product. Aside from all the glitches, bugs and outages, the user experience of Twitter has declined noticeably. The algorithmically selected “For You” tab that Musk launched in January feels more like other social media platforms — lots of pictures, videos and other viral-ready content that might be kind of addictive, but also utterly devoid of substance. We already have Instagram for that.  Twitter has also stopped allowing third-party apps — which have been an integral part of the user experience and of Twitter’s very development — to access its data freely, meaning most of these apps are now defunct.  And despite ads seeming to crop up far more than before, many advertisers have fled, causing revenues to plunge. It seems like users might be following them: according to SimilarWeb, a data intelligence company, Twitter’s total traffic declined by 2 per cent in January on a year-on-year basis. The complete data set for February is not yet available, but in the 28 days to February 25, traffic was down 5 per cent.  It might have felt like it was invincible at one point, but Twitter was never going to last for ever — the network effect that has kept all of us on the platform until now was always going to give way to another network at some point. When Twitter’s death does eventually come, we can’t lay all the blame on Musk. We can, however, blame him for making it so tedious.  jemima.kelly@ft.com UK Edition"

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights Feb 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Transportation said on Thursday it is investigating Elon Musk's brain-implant company Neuralink over the potentially illegal movement of hazardous pathogens. A Department of Transportation spokesperson told Reuters about the probe after the Physicians Committee of Responsible Medicine (PCRM), an animal-welfare advocacy group,wrote to Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg earlier on Thursday to alert it of records it obtained on the matter. PCRM said it obtained emails and other documents that suggest unsafe packaging and movement of implants removed from the brains of monkeys. These implants may have carried infectious diseases in violation of federal law, PCRM said. The Department of Transportation spokesperson said the agency took PCRM's allegations ""very seriously."" ""We are conducting an investigation to ensure that Neuralink is in full compliance with federal regulations and keeping their workers and the public safe from potentially dangerous pathogens,"" the spokesperson said. Representatives for Neuralink, including Musk, did not respond to comment requests. The Department of Transportation probe adds to the scrutiny facing Neuralink, which is developing a brain implant it hopes will help paralyzed people walk again and cure other neurological ailments. In December, Reuters reported that Neuralink has been under a federal investigation over potential animal welfare violations and that some of its staff made internal complaints about experiments being rushed, causing needless suffering and deaths. The letter said records that the group obtained showed instances of pathogens, such as antibiotic-resistant staphylococcus and herpes B virus, that may have been transported without proper containment measures. The incidents that involved potential breaches of hazardous material transportation regulations happened in 2019, when Neuralink relied on University of California, Davis to help carry out its experiments on primates, according to the documents cited by PCRM. While Neuralink's partnership with UC Davis ended in 2020, PCRM said the company continues to employ the neurosurgeon who oversaw the experiments and other staff involved may also still be employed. Reuters reviewed the UC Davis records cited by PCRM in its letter. It is unclear whether further records exist that provide a different or fuller account of what happened. PCRM obtained the records from UC Davis through public information requests. Neuralink messages and records not shared with UC Davis are not subject to such information requests. A UC Davis spokesperson would only say that the university abides by all biohazard and lab safety regulations. PCRM's letter said pathogens were carried on removed implants from monkeys after improper sanitization and packaging. The group said those pathogens could cause serious health issues in infected humans, such as bloodstream infections, pneumonia and severe brain damage, among other problems. PCRM, which opposes the use of animals in medical research, did not identify any harm as a result of these incidents, but said Neuralink's actions ""may pose a serious and ongoing public health risk."" ""The company's documented track record of sloppy, unsafe laboratory practices compel DOT to investigate and levy appropriate fines,"" PCRM said in the letter. PCRM said it also found instances that appear to describe UC Davis employees urging immediate biohazard training for Neuralink employees following incidents that had caused contamination concerns. On one occasion in April 2019, a UC Davis employee wrote in an email that the university’s primate center is “at risk” for “monkey contaminated hardware.” ""This is an exposure to anyone coming in contact with the contaminated explanted hardware and we are making a big deal about this because we are concerned for human safety,"" wrote the employee, whose name was redacted from the records. PCRM has raised concerns about Neuralink in the past. Last year, it wrote to federal officials about alleged animal-welfare issues during Neuralink’s research partnership with UC Davis, citing another set of records it obtained. A federal prosecutor in the Northern District of California referred PCRM's complaint to the USDA Inspector General, which later launched the federal probe into Neuralink, Reuters previously reported. During its partnership with UC Davis, Neuralink grew frustrated with what it regarded as the slow pace of testing on primates, current and former company employees told Reuters, and has since built out extensive in-house animal testing facilities. The company has missed deadlines set by Musk to proceed to human trials, however. His pressure on Neuralink’s staff to make progress contributed to mistakes plaguing some experiments, Reuters reported. Reporting by Rachael Levy in Washington, D.C.

A national survey conducted by IPR political scientist James Druckman before and after Musk's takeover of Twitter shows that its use dipped ...","Discover IPR How IPR provides evidence that fuels better decisions and policies Democrats are significantly more likely than Republicans to distrust Musk  Subscribe to newsletter Democrats presumably believe the information from particular sources on Twitter will remain trustworthy even if the technology itself may not.” James DruckmanIPR political scientist  Twitter's headquarters in downtown San Francisco. Since Elon Musk bought Twitter in October, the platform has experienced several tumultuous months under his leadership. His controversial decisions to lay off a significant portion of the workforce, temporarily suspend several journalists’ accounts, and restore previously banned accounts has roiled Twitter. A national survey conducted before and after Musk’s takeover of Twitter shows that its use dipped from around 32% of Americans in October to 30% in December and January. The decrease was largely driven by Democrats who left the platform, with 38% reporting they used it before Musk bought Twitter but only 33% reporting that they used it after he bought it. Use by Republicans and Independents declined slightly after Musk became CEO, but not significantly.     Between June and October 2022, a team of researchers from Northwestern, Harvard, Rutgers, and Northeastern universities conducted three surveys of more than 21,000 American adults about how they use and perceive Twitter. Following Musk’s acquisition at the end of October, they launched a fourth survey between December 2022 and January 2023, asking nearly 25,000 Americans the same questions to track changes in attitudes. “It is not surprising that Democrats see Elon Musk and Twitter as untrustworthy,” Northwestern PhD student Jonathan Schulman said, who led the report. ""But it is especially noteworthy that this distrust in Twitter and Musk was strong enough to actually drive a significant number of Democrats off the app."" The survey also showed partisan differences in Americans’ trust of Musk. Most Democrats surveyed, or 76%, reported that they did not trust Musk and Twitter to do “what is right,” compared with 47% of Republicans. Independents were also less trusting of Musk, with 67% saying they did not trust him “at all” or “not much.” Before Musk bought Twitter in October, Democrats were 15% more likely than Republicans to trust that Twitter would “do what is right.” After October, trust levels evened out—dropping for Democrats and rising for Republicans—so that 34% of users in each party now trust Twitter to do what is right. Despite the decrease in Democrats’ Twitter use and trust since Musk’s takeover, they did not significantly stop using Twitter for political news. Republicans, on the other hand, reported that they were slightly more likely to use Twitter as a source of political news, rising from 10% to 14%. “Democrats presumably believe the information from particular sources on Twitter will remain trustworthy even if the technology itself may not,” IPR political scientist James Druckman said, who co-authored the report. Additionally, the researchers asked participants about which social media sites they viewed as politically biased in December and January, which they compared with the January 2021 survey results. Though the surveys were two years apart and the changes cannot be solely attributed to Musk’s purchase of the platform, they indicate that Republicans and Independents saw a significant reduction in bias towards conservatives on Twitter, while Democrats and Independents saw a significant increase in bias against liberals.

Elon Musk fires a top Twitter engineer over his declining view count · For weeks now, Elon Musk has been preoccupied with worries about how many ...","For weeks now, Elon Musk has been preoccupied with worries about how many people are seeing his tweets. Last week, the Twitter CEO took his Twitter account private for a day to test whether that might boost the size of his audience. The move came after several prominent right-wing accounts that Musk interacts with complained that recent changes to Twitter had reduced their reach. On Tuesday, Musk gathered a group of engineers and advisors into a room at Twitter’s headquarters looking for answers. Why are his engagement numbers tanking? “This is ridiculous,” he said, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the meeting. “I have more than 100 million followers, and I’m only getting tens of thousands of impressions.” One of the company’s two remaining principal engineers offered a possible explanation for Musk’s declining reach: just under a year after the Tesla CEO made his surprise offer to buy Twitter for $44 billion, public interest in his antics is waning.   Employees showed Musk internal data regarding engagement with his account, along with a Google Trends chart. Last April, they told him, Musk was at “peak” popularity in search rankings, indicated by a score of “100.” Today, he’s at a score of nine. Engineers had previously investigated whether Musk’s reach had somehow been artificially restricted, but found no evidence that the algorithm was biased against him. Musk did not take the news well.  “You’re fired, you’re fired,” Musk told the engineer. (Platformer is withholding the engineer’s name in light of the harassment Musk has directed at former Twitter employees.) Dissatisfied with engineers’ work so far, Musk has instructed employees to track how many times each of his tweets are recommended, according to one current worker. It has now been seven weeks since Twitter added public view counts for every tweet. At the time, Musk promised that the feature would give the world a better sense of how vibrant the platform is.  “Shows how much more alive Twitter is than it may seem, as over 90% of Twitter users read, but don’t tweet, reply or like, as those are public actions,” he tweeted. Almost two months later, though, view counts have had the opposite effect, emphasizing how little engagement most posts get relative to their audience size. At the same time, Twitter usage in the United States has declined almost 9 percent since Musk’s takeover, according to one recent study. Twitter sources say the view count feature itself may be contributing to the decline in engagement, and therefore views. The like and retweet buttons were made smaller to accommodate the display of views, making them harder to easily tap. An even more obvious reason for the decline in engagement is Twitter’s increasingly glitchy product, which has baffled users with its disappearing mentions, shifting algorithmic priorities, and tweets inserted seemingly at random from accounts they don’t follow. On Wednesday, the company suffered one of its first major outages since Musk took over, with users being told, inexplicably, “You are over the daily limit for sending tweets.” It turns out that an employee had inadvertently deleted data for an internal service that sets rate limits for using Twitter. The team that worked on that service left the company in November. “As the adage goes, ‘you ship your org chart,’” said one current employee. “It’s chaos here right now, so we’re shipping chaos.” Interviews with current Twitter employees paint a picture of a deeply troubled workplace, where Musk’s whim-based approach to product management leaves workers scrambling to implement new features even as the core service falls apart. The disarray makes it less likely that Musk will ever recoup the $44 billion he spent to buy Twitter, and may hasten its decline into insolvency.  “We haven’t seen much in the way of longer term, cogent strategy,” one employee said. “Most of our time is dedicated to three main areas: putting out fires (mostly caused by firing the wrong people and trying to recover from that), performing impossible tasks, and ‘improving efficiency’ without clear guidelines of what the expected end results are. We mostly move from dumpster fire to dumpster fire, from my perspective.” Musk’s product feedback, which comes largely from replies to his tweets, often baffles his workers.  “There’s times he’s just awake late at night and says all sorts of things that don’t make sense,” one employee said. “And then he’ll come to us and be like, ‘this one person says they can’t do this one thing on the platform,’ and then we have to run around chasing some outlier use case for one person. It doesn’t make any sense.” The San Francisco headquarters, whose landlord has sued Twitter for nonpayment of rent, has a melancholy air. When people pass each other in the halls, we’re told that the standard greeting is “where are you interviewing?” and “where do you have offers?” The 8th floor is still stocked with beds, and employees have to reserve them in advance.  “Most weeknights, they are fully booked,” another current employee said. The perks that made Twitter an attractive place to work pre-Musk have been eradicated. Food at the office? “Sucks – and now we have to pay for it. And, I know this sounds petty, but they appear to have obtained the absolute worst coffee vendors on earth.” Slack – once the epicenter of Twitter’s open culture, where employees discussed anything and everything – has gone dormant. One current employee described it as a “ghost town.”  “People don’t even chat about work things anymore,” the employee said. “It’s just heartbreaking. I have more conversations with my colleagues on Signal and WhatsApp than I do on Slack. Before the transition, it was not uncommon in the team channel to talk about what everybody did that weekend. There’s none of that anymore.”  When Musk or the goons ask questions, employees are torn between giving the right answer and the safe answer.  “When you’re asked a question, you run it through your head and say ‘what is the least fireable response I can have to this right now?’” one employee explained. (Of course, that’s not true for everyone at the company. “There are a handful of true believers that are obviously just ass-kissers and brown-nosers who are trying to take advantage of the clear vacuum that exists,” that same employee says.)  Despite the turmoil, remaining employees say that what they call “Twitter 2.0” has managed to improve on its predecessor in at least some ways.  “In the past, Twitter operated too often by committees that went nowhere,” one employee said. “I do appreciate the fact that if you want to do something that you think will improve something, you generally have license to do it. But that’s a double edged sword — moving that fast can lead to unintended consequences.”  The employee cited the disastrous relaunch of Twitter Blue, which resulted in brands being impersonated and dozens of top advertisers fleeing the platform. “If Elon can learn how to put a bit more thought into some of the decisions, and fire from the hip a bit less, it might do some good,” the employee said. “He needs to learn the areas where he just does not know things and let those that do know take over.”  At the same time, “he really doesn’t like to believe that there is anything in technology that he doesn’t know, and that’s frustrating,” the employee said. “You can’t be the smartest person in the room about everything, all the time.” With Musk continuing to fire people impulsively, entire teams have been wiped out, and their work is being handed to other, overstretched teams that often have little understanding of the new work that is being assigned to them.  “They have to become code archaeologists to dig through the repo and figure out what’s going on,” one employee said. Meanwhile, the recent wave of layoffs in the tech industry have contributed to a feeling of paralysis among those who remain at Twitter.  “I do think the recent vibe overall in tech, and fear of not being able to find something else, is the primary factor for most folks,” an employee said. “I know for a fact that most of my team is doing hardcore interview prep, and would jump at likely any opportunity to walk away.” There is also a sense of unease about how recent changes will be reviewed by regulators. As part of an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, Twitter committed to following a series of steps before pushing out changes, including creating a project proposal and conducting security and privacy reviews.  Since Musk took over, those steps have become an afterthought, employees said. “His stance is basically ‘fuck you regulators,’” we’re told.  The FTC plans to audit the company this quarter, we’re told, and employees have doubts that Twitter has the necessary documentation in place to pass inspection. “FTC compliance is concerning,” one says.  Last year, before Musk took over, the FTC fined Twitter $150 million for breaking its agreement. Another breach would almost certainly result in millions of dollars in additional fines, and a flurry of news coverage — just the thing, perhaps, to get the views on Musk’s tweets trending up again. Elsewhere in Twitter: Twitter sent EU regulators an incomplete report on how its tackling disinformation and failed to include commitments that it would empower fact-checkers. A congressional hearing on the Twitter Files offered plenty of heated exchanges but little new information. Musk reinstated the account of a Republican senator after it was blocked for a hunting photo flagged as “graphic violence.” Multiple senior employees left Twitter after their pre-takeover stock vested on February 1. Twitter rolled out its subscription service, Twitter Blue, to users in India, Brazil and Indonesia.

Despite the turmoil, remaining employees say that what they call “Twitter 2.0” has managed to improve on its predecessor in at least some ways.  “In the past, Twitter operated too often by committees that went nowhere,” one employee said. “I do appreciate the fact that if you want to do something that you think will improve something, you generally have license to do it. But that’s a double edged sword — moving that fast can lead to unintended consequences.”  The employee cited the disastrous relaunch of Twitter Blue, which resulted in brands being impersonated and dozens of top advertisers fleeing the platform. “If Elon can learn how to put a bit more thought into some of the decisions, and fire from the hip a bit less, it might do some good,” the employee said. “He needs to learn the areas where he just does not know things and let those that do know take over.”  At the same time, “he really doesn’t like to believe that there is anything in technology that he doesn’t know, and that’s frustrating,” the employee said. “You can’t be the smartest person in the room about everything, all the time.” “His stance is basically ‘fuck you, regulators.’” With Musk continuing to fire people impulsively, entire teams have been wiped out, and their work is being handed to other overstretched teams that often have little understanding of the new work that is being assigned to them.  “They have to become code archaeologists to dig through the repo and figure out what’s going on,” one employee said. Meanwhile, the recent wave of layoffs in the tech industry has contributed to a feeling of paralysis among those who remain at Twitter.  “I do think the recent vibe overall in tech, and fear of not being able to find something else, is the primary factor for most folks,” an employee said. “I know for a fact that most of my team is doing hardcore interview prep and would jump at likely any opportunity to walk away.” There is also a sense of unease about how recent changes will be reviewed by regulators. As part of an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, Twitter committed to following a series of steps before pushing out changes, including creating a project proposal and conducting security and privacy reviews.  Since Musk took over, those steps have become an afterthought, employees said. “His stance is basically ‘fuck you, regulators,’” we’re told.  The FTC plans to audit the company this quarter, we’re told, and employees have doubts that Twitter has the necessary documentation in place to pass inspection. “FTC compliance is concerning,” one says.  Last year, before Musk took over, the FTC fined Twitter $150 million for breaking its agreement. Another breach would almost certainly result in millions of dollars in additional fines and a flurry of news coverage — just the thing, perhaps, to get the views on Musk’s tweets trending up again.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

Twitter will discontinue offering free access to the Twitter API starting February 9 and will launch a paid version.","Twitter will discontinue offering free access to the Twitter API starting February 9 and will launch a paid version, the Elon Musk-owned microblogging website said as it looks for more avenues to monetize the platform. In a series of tweets, the Twitter Developer account said the firm will be ending support for both legacy v1.1 and the new v2 of its Twitter APIs. It did not immediately say how much it plans to charge for API usage. The move follows Twitter abruptly changing the terms of its API in recent weeks; the API was used by many popular Twitter clients, such as Tweetbot and Twitterrific. Most third-party Twitter apps have shut down their mobile apps. “Twitter data are among the world’s most powerful data sets. We’re committed to enabling fast & comprehensive access so you can continue to build with us,” Twitter Dev account said Thursday. “Over the years, hundreds of millions of people have sent over a trillion Tweets, with billions more every week.” “we cut everyone off with no notice but now we would like you to pay us instead” 😂 https://t.co/VMtTAJYxNY — Owen Williams ⚡ (@ow) February 2, 2023  In the aftermath of the recent changes that saw Twitter shutter third-party clients, many other app developers had grown cautious about the ways they advanced development atop of the Twitter API. This new move might leave some developers to either abandon their products or pass on the cost to their customers. Thousands of developers use the Twitter API for scores of things such as tracking changes among Twitter accounts and offering alerts. These are fun side projects for people who might not be willing to pay fees for something that they themselves are not monetizing. Then there is another specific user base of the Twitter API: Researchers. Twitter’s new announcement might impact research in different areas, including hate speech and online abuse. Universities often use Twitter to study human behavior in different regions. Putting a cap on free API usage could also stop firms working around detecting the spread of misinformation on Twitter. Twitter has had a strange relationship with developers since its inception. But the relationship, however inconvenient, was benign for both parties. Third-party firms were often the ones shipping new products and features for Twitter and the social network did its part by not charging them for the API usage. In recent years, Twitter even attempted to repair relationships with developers by launching new programs like the Twitter toolbox for app discovery. Several of such initiatives have been shut down under the new management. Under Musk’s helm, Twitter is scrambling to control how users around the globe access the platform as it broadens its attempts to monetize the service. Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion in late October. He took a loan of about $12.5 billion to finance the deal. To keep Twitter alive, a service that is not profitable, Musk has to pay an additional $1.5 billion a year in interest alone. So naturally, Musk is pushing to make Twitter more self-sustainable. Twitter has revamped — and made more expensive — its subscription service and tweaked how tweets appear on a user’s timeline to make the platform more engaging, lucrative and an attractive destination for an otherwise increasingly dwindling advertiser base. Developer platforms are all about trust, and Twitter lost it "

This comes just days after Musk complained ...","By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  For many of us, Twitter’s “For You” is full of tweets and replies to tweets from Elon Musk. Not everyone is getting the Musk-first feed, but on Monday afternoon, more than a few people noticed something was different. Several of us here at The Verge are seeing more Musk replies than usual, and I personally counted five at the very top of my feed, with many more sprinkled in between tweets from other users. The same is true for some accounts that don’t even follow Musk. In an apparent acknowledgment early Tuesday morning, Musk tweeted, “Please stay tuned while we make adjustments to the uh .… ‘algorithm.’”  This comes just days after Musk complained that his tweets weren’t getting enough views — and even fired an engineer over it.  As reported by Platformer’s Zoë Schiffer and Casey Newton, internal Twitter data indicates that while Musk’s account rose to peak popularity in search rankings in April 2022, engagement has since dropped significantly, and engineers found no issue with Twitter’s algorithm. Over the weekend, Musk said Twitter rolled out some sort of change to fix this “visibility” issue, with the billionaire CEO stating that 95 percent of his tweets weren’t “getting delivered.” I’m not sure if this is at all related to this Musk-filled feed, but I’m hoping Twitter fixes this issue soon — unless the new mandate is to get the boss more views by any means necessary.

The latest cuts come as Elon Musk has given the directive to make Twitter ads work like Google search ads, focusing on user's keyword ...","By  Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He’s covered the tech industry for over a decade at The Information and other outlets. On November 21st, Elon Musk gathered Twitter’s remaining employees at its San Francisco headquarters to tell them that, after forcing out roughly two-thirds of the workforce in a matter of weeks, layoffs were over. He keeps laying people off anyway. Dozens of Twitter employees across sales and engineering departments were laid off last week, including one of Musk’s direct reports who was managing engineering for Twitter’s ads business, according to company sources and social media posts from affected employees seen by The Verge. This means Musk has done at least three rounds of layoffs since his promise to stop doing them in November. Meanwhile, he has given a directive internally to revamp how ads are targeted in Twitter’s main feed within a week — part of his plan to fix what he has publically called “the worst ad relevance on Earth.” (The Information first reported that fresh cuts hit the sales team last week.) Musk’s plan is to change Twitter’s ad targeting to work like Google’s search ads, which target primarily by keywords that are searched for, rather than a user’s activity and profile data. It’s an approach that works well for a search engine — where people go to express specific intent for finding something — and has helped Google build one of the most profitable businesses of all time. But it hasn’t worked for a social media business to date. In a tweet on Saturday, Marcin Kadluczka, the laid-off engineering manager for monetization who reported directly to Musk, hinted at the infeasibility of the one-week deadline in a tweet: “I believe Twitter can really improve ads in 2-3 months (no necessarily in a week though).” I’ve confirmed that Musk gave the aggressive deadline just before Kadluczka and others in the ads, consumer, and sales orgs were laid off last Friday.  Here is where I’ll caveat that Musk gave a similar deadline to revamp Twitter Blue when he first bought the company that wasn’t met. He could also change his mind about how ads should work on Twitter. He didn’t respond to an email asking for comment. Improving Twitter’s ads has been a key focus of Musk’s since he bought the company. He has correctly pointed out that Twitter’s ads are less personalized and effective than its competitors. (As my colleague Nilay Patel likes to say, critiquing the Musk era of Twitter is by no means an endorsement of the previous regime.) But it’s unclear if changing targeting to be keyword-driven like Google ads will actually improve the quality of Twitter’s advertising, as others with a better understanding of the trade-offs than me have pointed out: Do you know more about what’s going on inside Twitter?

Entre as empresas que ...","Entrar Entrar  Entrar Seguros Agro IM Trader 15% de Investback na Black Friday Lucrando com o Medo Conheça a história do empreendedor que viabilizou a exploração espacial privada, a criação de uma montadora global de carros elétricos e um novo sistema de transporte urbano Elon Musk é um dos empreendedores mais ousados dos últimos tempos, viabilizando projetos inovadores e com tecnologia de última geração. Entre as empresas que fundou ou comandou, aparecem nomes como Paypal, Tesla, SpaceX e Neura Link. Sua trajetória chama a atenção pela diversidade de áreas de atuação; geolocalização, energia limpa, mobilidade, exploração espacial, inteligência artificial e neurociência são alguns dos campos em que Musk investiu. Elon Musk nasceu em uma família de classe alta em Pretória, na África do Sul, filho da nutricionista e modelo Maye Musk com Errol Musk, um engenheiro mecânico, piloto de aviões e empresário. O casal se separou em 1979 e os três filhos – Elon, Kimbal e Tosca – ficaram com Maye por dois anos até que ele, o mais velho, decidiu ir morar com o pai quando tinha dez anos. Musk achava injusto que sua mãe ficasse com os todos os filhos, enquanto o pai vivia sozinho. Então deixou a casa de Maye e se mudou para o subúrbio de Pretória – o que, muitos anos depois, consideraria como um grande erro. Isso porque, apesar de reconhecer que grande parte do que aprendeu de engenharia básica foi pela influência de seu pai, a relação entre os dois nunca foi boa. Elon já disse que Errol é “um péssimo ser humano”. Em entrevista à revista Rolling Stone, chegou a chorar ao dizer que seu pai era uma pessoa ruim, capaz até de cometer crimes. As razões para essa conclusão, Elon não explicou. Disse apenas que era comum que seu pai o chamasse de “idiota”. Seu pai ficou conhecido por algumas polêmicas, como ter engravidado sua enteada, 40 anos mais nova, que conheceu quando ela tinha quatro anos. Errol matou a tiros três homens que invadiram sua residência. Um “nerd” assumido, Elon Musk se refugiou na leitura de livros como o Guia do Mochileiro das Galáxias, de Douglas Adams, Senhor dos Anéis, de J. R. R. Tolkien, e a Série da Fundação, de Isaac Asimov. “Fui criado por livros. Livros, e depois meus pais”. Aos dez anos gostava de fazer experimentos com explosivos e pequenos foguetes e começou a se interessar por programação. Aos 12, fechou seu primeiro negócio ao escrever o código de videogame e o vender para a revista PC and Office Technology, por US$ 500. Apesar de prodigiosa, sua infância na África do Sul foi marcada por diversos episódios de bullying no colégio. Nascido no final de junho, Elon Musk era um dos mais novos – e menores – alunos da sala e foi alvo de atos violentos. No pior deles, foi derrubado da escada e seu rosto batido diversas vezes no chão até desmaiar.O suplício do colégio só acabou aos 16 anos, depois que decidiu aprender a se defender e entrou em aulas de caratê, judô e luta livre e passou a encarar seus desafetos. “Nerd” assumido, Elon Musk se refugiou na leitura de livros como “Guia do Mochileiro das Galáxias”, de Douglas Adams, e a trilogia “Senhor dos Anéis”, de J. R. R. Tolkien, e a série “Fundação”, de Isaac Asimov. “Fui criado por livros. Livros, e depois meus pais”, disse Musk. Aos dez anos, ele já gostava de fazer experimentos com explosivos e pequenos foguetes, além de começar a se interessar por programação. Aos 12 anos, fechou seu primeiro negócio ao escrever o código de programação de um jogo e o vender para a revista PC and Office Technology, por US$ 500. Apesar de prodigiosa, sua infância na África do Sul foi marcada por diversos episódios de bullying no colégio. Nascido no final de junho, Elon Musk era um dos mais novos – e menores – alunos de sua classe e era alvo constante de ataques. No pior deles, foi derrubado de uma escada e teve seu rosto batido diversas vezes no chão até desmaiar. O suplício no colégio só acabou aos 16 anos, após ele decidir aprender a se defender, entrando em aulas de caratê, judô e luta livre – e passou a encarar seus desafetos. Aos 17 anos, Musk decidiu sair da África do Sul. Ele queria ir para os Estados Unidos, país que acreditava ser o melhor lugar para fazer “coisas grandes”. As complicações com a imigração, no entanto, o fizeram aproveitar a cidadania canadense da mãe e se mudar primeiro para a província de Ontário, no Canadá. O início da vida canadense não foi fácil. Aos 17 anos, Musk precisou da ajuda de parentes e fez bicos como limpador de aquecedores e cortador de madeira para pagar as contas e se matricular na Queen’s University, em Kingston. Dois anos depois, ele conseguiu transferir seus estudos para a Universidade da Pensilvânia, nos EUA, onde formou-se em Economia e Física. Seus resultados acadêmicos lhe garantiram uma vaga no programa de PhD da Universidade de Stanford, onde se matriculou para cursar Física e Ciência de Materiais. Mas sua vida em Stanford durou pouco. Bem pouco, na verdade.  Apenas dois dias depois de começarem as aulas, Musk decidiu largar a famosa universidade californiana para montar a sua primeira empresa, em uma sociedade com seu irmão Kimbal. Elon e Kimbal viram uma oportunidade no boom da internet dos anos 1990 e criaram a Global Link, uma empresa de mapeamento de cidades que teria nos jornais seus principais clientes. Sem recursos próprios, os irmãos Musk levantam capital com um pequeno grupo de investidores-anjo e com seu sócio na empreitada, Greg Kouri, que aportou US$ 6 mil. Reunindo dados públicos de mapas e negócios, a empresa criou um banco de dados e serviços para comerciantes locais anunciarem e se conectarem a clientes. A solução inovadora atraiu clientes como o jornal The New York Times e outras 160 publicações. A empresa cresceu com o aporte de US$ 3 milhões de um investidor e foi rebatizada como Zip2. Em abril de 1998, a Zip2 entrou em negociação para se fundir com a sua principal concorrente, a CitySearch. Elon Musk, que inicialmente apoiou a ideia, foi uma das principais vozes para convencer os conselheiros a abandonarem o projeto. A decisão foi acertada. Em menos de um ano, em fevereiro de 1999, a fabricante de computadores Compaq pagou US$ 305 milhões para adquirir a Zip2 e, assim, alavancar seu buscador AltaVista. Nessa operação, Elon Musk embolsou US$ 22 milhões. Capitalizado, Musk criou a X.com em novembro do mesmo ano, um dos primeiros bancos online do mundo, em parceria com seu antigo sócio Greg Kouri. A empreitada durou pouco tempo. Já em março de 2000, o X.com se uniu a seu competidor, a Confinity. Como maior acionista, Musk virou o CEO da nova empresa. No comando da X.com fortificada com a fusão, Elon Musk acabou deixando de lado as iniciativas de seu negócio original e deu prioridade ao desenvolvimento do sistema de pagamentos que era desenvolvido pela Confinity desde 1999, o PayPal. Em questão de meses, ele abandonou a atuação como banco online, rebatizou a empresa como PayPal e a levou a abrir o capital. O IPO foi realizado em 2002, levantando US$ 61 milhões. A facilidade dos pagamentos pelo sistema do PayPal atraiu o interesse da gigante online eBay, que adquiriu a companhia meses depois, em outubro de 2002, por US$ 1,5 bilhão, 77% acima do preço do IPO. Na época, 70% de todas as transações realizadas no eBay utilizavam o PayPal como meio de pagamento. Com a venda, Musk decidiu se desfazer dos 11,7% que tinha no PayPal e embolsar mais US$ 165 milhões.Empreendedor serial, Musk não se aposentou após faturar com a venda de suas duas primeiras companhias.  Na verdade, antes mesmo da venda do PayPal, Musk já estava desenvolvendo o seu novo e – possivelmente – mais ambicioso projeto: a exploração espacial. Elon Musk é movido por grandes medos e não tem vergonha de compartilhá-los em suas palestras e entrevistas. Com o sucesso de seus empreendimentos online entre o final da década de 1990 e o início dos anos 2000, sobrevivendo à bolha da internet, Musk passou a focar seus esforços em grandes projetos que buscam diminuir seu medo sobre o fim da humanidade. Uma de suas apostas é expandir a presença humana pelo Sistema Solar, com o estabelecimento de colônias humanas em diversos planetas, a começar por Marte. Musk está cada vez mais próximo de seu objetivo de colocar uma expedição no planeta vermelho e iniciar a colonização. O que era um sonho impossível e parecia uma conversa excêntrica, hoje é visto por analistas como algo possível, depois de quase duas décadas de desenvolvimento de foguetes e soluções aeroespaciais. Tudo começou ainda em 2001, quando Musk idealizou o Mars Oasis (Oásis de Marte), o projeto de instalar uma estufa experimental em Marte e tentar cultivar alimentos no árido e tóxico solo marciano.Para chegar lá, ele queria adquirir um míssil balístico intercontinental russo por um preço acessível. Se possível, um modelo já usado. A ideia era excêntrica mesmo para os padrões do empreendedor. Um de seus melhores amigos desde a época da universidade, Adeo Ressi, acreditava que ele estava enlouquecendo. Ressi chegou a convidar amigos próximos para tentar uma intervenção e fazê-lo desistir da ideia. Não deu certo. Em outubro de 2001, Musk viajou para a Rússia com Jim Cantrell, que atuava na área aeroespacial, e com o próprio Ressi para reuniões com empresas como a Kosmotras e a NPO Lavochkin, que construíram sondas para o governo soviético explorar Vênus e Marte durante a corrida espacial. Após um almoço longo seguido de café com charutos, Musk e seus parceiros foram tratados com pouco respeito pelos russos, que os consideravam novatos. O fracasso da primeira tentativa, porém, não impediu Musk de ir aos russos novamente. Desta vez, para comprar não um, mas três mísseis. Poucos meses depois, em fevereiro de 2002, Musk pousou em Moscou com sua equipe para uma nova rodada de negociações. Dessa vez, levou alguém mais experiente para fazer parte da equipe: Mike Griffin, engenheiro renomado e que, anos depois, assumiria a administração da Nasa.  Depois de algumas doses de vodca, Musk perguntou diretamente aos representantes da Kosmotras quanto custaria cada foguete. Ele tentou negociar o preço inicial de US$ 8 milhões por unidade, mas novamente não foi levado a sério. A decepção da segunda tentativa fez Musk acreditar que não era possível negociar com os russos. Ele sabia que não tinha dinheiro para comprar de outro fornecedor. Nesse ponto, em que muitos desistiriam, Musk mostrou um lado de seu empreendedorismo que o acompanharia em futuros negócios: se não há uma solução disponível, ele criaria essa solução.A sacada veio no voo de volta de Moscou, quando disse aos seus parceiros que eles poderiam fazer um foguete próprio. Era a realização de um sonho de infância, quando brincava em construir foguetes no quintal da sua casa e lia ficção científica. Em suas contas, o custo do material para construir um foguete era relativamente pequeno e eles poderiam reduzir em 90% o custo de produção ao verticalizar o negócio. Enquanto maturava o projeto de exploração espacial comercial, Musk se reunia com uma organização de entusiastas que estuda tecnologias para explorar Marte. Ele não havia desistido da sua ideia de construir uma estufa no Planeta Vermelho para permitir que, no futuro, o ser humano possa colonizar o planeta e diminuir a possibilidade de extinção da espécie. Após doações generosas, passou a fazer rodadas de discussões com especialistas para reunir ideias de como levar até Marte um rato, plantar, colher – e trazer o rato de volta à Terra. Em maio de 2002, com US$ 100 milhões de sua fortuna pessoal, Musk criou a Space Exploration Technologies, ou SpaceX. O objetivo da empresa? Espalhar a civilização humana pelo espaço. A relação conturbada com os russos deu lugar aos contatos com empresas privadas americanas de engenharia.  Como um bom nerd, o primeiro foguete foi batizado de Falcon 1, em homenagem à Millenium Falcon, do filme Star Wars. O foguete foi lançado com sucesso em março de 2006. A SpaceX conquistou seguidos recordes de eficiência e o ineditismo de ser uma empresa privada, alcançando feitos que apenas estatais como a Nasa haviam conseguido. A agência americana, aliás, é um dos principais clientes da SpaceX, cujos foguetes abastecem a Estação Espacial Internacional, além de colocar em órbita satélites comerciais e militares. Em 2014, o governo dos EUA mostrou, em números, a eficiência da SpaceX: enquanto a Força Aérea do país pagava até US$ 400 milhões por um lançamento para a United Launch Alliance (ULA), a mesma operação era conduzida por menos de US$ 100 milhões pela empresa de Musk. Além do custo mais baixo, há também o espetáculo. Cada lançamento da SpaceX é um show transmitido ao vivo pela internet, com apresentadores, bom humor e funcionários da empresa torcendo e comemorando. Até um carro Tesla Roadster foi lançado no espaço pela SpaceX com um foguete Falcon Heavy. O veículo é “tripulado” por um manequim chamado Starman, vestido com trajes especiais. É possível acompanhar o trajeto do Roadster pelo site whereisroadster.com. View from SpaceX Launch Control. Apparently, there is a car in orbit around Earth. pic.twitter.com/QljN2VnL1O Além de alcançar o espaço, a SpaceX inovou ao conseguir reaproveitar peças. Parte dos queimadores de lançamento e o núcleo do foguete voltam e pousam suavemente na Terra. E quem comanda tudo é o CEO e diretor de tecnologia, Elon Musk, que detém 78% dos direitos de voto da companhia de mais de 7 mil funcionários. A preocupação de Musk com a extinção humana também fez com que ele agisse contra as mudanças climáticas. A solução foram os carros elétricos, que se tornaram quase sinônimo do nome da sua empresa: Tesla. Assim como ocorreu com o PayPal, Musk não fundou a Tesla, mas viu oportunidade no negócio logo no início da jornada, catapultando os resultados para uma operação global. A empresa foi criada em julho de 2003 pelos engenheiros Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, na Califórnia, após a GM fazer um recall e destruir seu modelo elétrico EV1. Na primeira rodada de financiamento Series A da Tesla, em fevereiro de 2004, Musk liderou os investidores com aporte de US$ 6,5 milhões do total de US$ 7,5 milhões arrecadados e passou a presidir o conselho de administração da companhia. Com o aporte, Musk passou a estar mais presente no dia a dia da empresa e acompanhou o lançamento do primeiro modelo, o Tesla Roadster. Nas rodadas Series B e C, Musk também foi um dos principais investidores, com aporte de US$ 9 milhões, de US$ 13 milhões, e depois, com mais US$ 12 milhões de US$ 40 milhões. Nesta última rodada, participaram investidores de peso como Sergey Brin e Larry Page, os fundadores do Google, Jeff Skoll, ex-presidente do eBay, e fundos geridos pelo JPMorgan. Após a crise de 2008, quando o fundador Martin Eberhard deixou a Tesla, Musk assumiu como CEO da companhia e se transformou no rosto da empresa, responsável pelas apresentações pirotécnicas de cada novo modelo. Com o dinheiro arrecadado nas vendas do Roadster, a Tesla passou a trabalhar no sedã Model S, lançado em 2012, seguido pelo SUV Model X, três anos depois. A chegada do Model 3 em 2017 marcou a primeira produção em grande escala global. A estratégia da Tesla se assemelha à da SpaceX na verticalização. A empresa produz cerca de 80% das peças, distanciando- se das montadoras tradicionais, que se apoiam em fornecedores e focam na engenharia e conclusão do veículo. Assim como no caso da irmã espacial, ao ser a pioneira de um mercado em formação, a Tesla precisou criar negócios para solucionar gargalos e barreiras ao seu crescimento. A montadora possui fábricas de baterias, redes de carregamento de carros elétricos e produz painéis solares para alimentar a rede de energia. Para financiar seu objetivo audacioso de ser uma montadora global, a empresa fez em 2010 seu IPO. Atualmente, é a companhia do setor mais valiosa dos EUA listada em bolsa, ao superar a tradicional GM. Apesar da liderança no setor, Musk se arrepende de ter listado a Tesla. Agora, a empresa enfrenta forte pressão de vendedores da ação, que amplificam problemas para prejudicar a companhia. Assim, a montadora fica constantemente entre as que têm mais posições vendidas, com bilhões de dólares apostando na queda dos papéis. O motivo para a volatilidade é até razoável: a Tesla ainda não conquistou a confiança de que consegue produzir veículos maciçamente, a um preço lucrativo e no prazo estabelecido. Mas não é só isso. A figura de Elon Musk também provoca controvérsias. Em um tuíte em setembro de 2018, por exemplo, Musk disse que tinha recursos assegurados para fechar o capital da empresa. Investigado pela SEC (o órgão regulador do mercado de capitais americano), Musk não provou que tinha os termos do negócio assegurados e correu o risco de ser afastado do posto de CEO da montadora. O caso foi encerrado após um acordo, no qual Musk e a Tesla pagariam US$ 20 milhões cada, ele deixaria o cargo de presidente do conselho e teria os seus tuítes revisados antes de serem publicados. Pouco tempo depois, em entrevista, Musk disse não ter se arrependido da polêmica e ainda afirmou que não tem nenhum respeito pela SEC. Ele provou isso meses depois, em fevereiro de 2019, quando voltou a fazer previsões para a Tesla em seu Twitter, provocando a reação do órgão regulador. Novamente, chegaram a uma solução negociada: o acordo inicial foi revisto para esclarecer assuntos que Musk não poderia publicar na rede social sem supervisão. Polêmico, Musk sempre volta às manchetes com aparições pouco usuais. Em resposta, o mercado derruba as ações da Tesla. Entre as atitudes que foram “castigadas” pelo mercado, está a infame participação de Musk em um episódio do podcast de Joe Rogan, um dos mais populares dos EUA. Na gravação, Musk aparece fumando maconha e chamando de “pedófilo” o mergulhador britânico Vernon Unsworth, que ajudava no resgate dos meninos presos em uma caverna inundada na Tailândia. O ataque de Musk foi uma resposta ao fato de Unsworth ter criticado e falado que era uma tentativa de atrair mídia a tentativa de ajuda de Musk às crianças tailandesas. Nos últimos anos, vivendo o sucesso da SpaceX e a escalada global da Tesla, Musk também passou a se dedicar em outros projetos – que, novamente, combatem seu medo de fim dos humanos. Além da tentativa de espalhar a espécie humana pelo Sistema Solar e reduzir a mudança climática, Musk tenta combater o seu temor de erradicação dos humanos pelas máquinas. Ele acredita que a inteligência artificial (IA) poderá dar superpoderes a corporações e governos, e até mesmo provocar uma ‘explosão de inteligência’, que colocaria máquinas no comando, um risco fatal à humanidade. O seu contra-ataque às máquinas vem em duas frentes. A primeira é a OpenAI, organização sem fins lucrativos que visa promover e inteligência artificial para beneficiar a população. A organização foi criada no final de 2015, e Musk permaneceu no conselho até 2018, quando renunciou para evitar conflitos de interesse com o desenvolvimento de IA da Tesla. Ele segue como um dos doadores, assim como a Microsoft, que aportou US$ 1 bilhão em 2019. Na outra frente, Musk criou a Neuralink em 2016, que tenta desenvolver uma conexão entre o cérebro e computadores. Contraditório? Não para Musk. A ideia é que a raça humana consiga, com apoio de computadores, acompanhar o desenvolvimento das máquinas e não ser dominado por elas. Para o projeto, Elon destinou US$ 100 milhões. Nos últimos anos, vivendo o sucesso da SpaceX e a escalada global da Tesla, Musk também passou a se dedicar a outros projetos – que, novamente, tentam aliviar seu medo da extinção humana. Além da tentativa de espalhar a espécie humana pelo Sistema Solar e reduzir a mudança climática, Musk tenta combater o seu temor de erradicação dos humanos pelas máquinas. Ele acredita que a inteligência artificial (IA) poderá dar superpoderes a corporações e governos e até mesmo provocar uma “explosão de inteligência” que colocaria máquinas no comando, um risco fatal à humanidade. Seu contra-ataque às máquinas vem em duas frentes. A primeira é a OpenAI, organização sem fins lucrativos que visa promover a inteligência artificial para beneficiar a população. A organização foi criada no final de 2015. Musk permaneceu no conselho até 2018, quando renunciou para evitar conflitos de interesse com o desenvolvimento de IA da Tesla. Ele segue como um dos financiadores, assim como a Microsoft, que aportou US$ 1 bilhão em 2019. Em outra frente, Musk criou a Neuralink em 2016, que tenta desenvolver uma conexão entre o cérebro e os computadores. Contraditório? Não para Musk. A ideia é que a espécie humana consiga, com o apoio de computadores, acompanhar o desenvolvimento das máquinas e não ser dominada por elas. Para o projeto, Elon já destinou US$ 100 milhões. Em seu projeto mais recente, Elon Musk criou a The Boring Company, ou TBC, em dezembro de 2016. O nome é um trocadilho com a palavra “boring” que, em inglês, pode significar tanto algo entediante como “tuneladora”, máquina usada na escavação de túneis. No caso da empresa de Musk, o tédio de ficar preso no trânsito de Los Angeles o fez pensar em como reduzir o custo de criar túneis para construir avenidas e acabar com os congestionamentos de veículos. A TBC surgiu como uma subsidiária da SpaceX, que emprestou engenheiros para os primeiros projetos conceituais e estudos de viabilidade da empresa. Ela era uma brincadeira para Musk. Tanto que, para financiar a TBC, vendeu 50 mil chapéus em janeiro de 2018, levantando US$ 1 milhão. Com o sucesso, colocou à venda 20 mil lança-chamas. “Uma péssima ideia”, lembra Musk. A empresa vendeu o estoque em poucos dias e arrecadou US$ 10 milhões. Apesar de a TBC ser praticamente um hobby, Musk não deixa de lado seu estilo de cobrança. Em reunião de sexta-feira na SpaceX, perguntou quanto tempo era necessário para esvaziar o estacionamento da empresa e começar a perfuração do primeiro túnel. Confrontado com a resposta de duas semanas, rebateu com a ideia de começar imediatamente, rodando por 48 horas até o domingo à tarde para medir o avanço. Isso provocou uma corrida dos funcionários para retirar os carros. Ainda em fase pré-operacional, mas já desligada da SpaceX desde 2018, a TBC possui diversos projetos em estudo em Los Angeles, além de outras cidades na Califórnia, Chicago, Las Vegas e uma audaciosa conexão de veículos em altíssima velocidade – batizada de Hyperloop – de Baltimore a Washington, parando em Nova York. Uma sacada, contudo, ajuda bastante seus negócios. Os túneis urbanos não têm ventilação e não são adequados para veículos que emitem gases de combustão. A solução seria liberar somente para carros elétricos, como… os da Tesla. Em 2017, Musk já havia manifestado interesse em comprar o Twitter, questionando o compromisso da plataforma em relação à liberdade de expressão. Mas em janeiro de 2022, o bilionário começou a comprar ações da empresa.  Em abril, ele se tornou o maior acionista ao controlar 9,2% da companhia. As ações dispararam, no maior salto dos papéis desde o IPO do Twitter, em 2013. Mas para Musk, não era o suficiente. Em 13 de abril, Musk fez uma oferta de US$ 43 bilhões para comprar 100% das ações do Twitter. O conselho da empresa não gostou da ideia, adotando a chamada “pílula de veneno”, que impede um acionista de ter mais de 15% das ações da empresa sem autorização prévia. Em resposta, Musk aumentou a proposta para US$ 44 bilhões. Dessa vez, não houve recusa do conselho. No negócio, foram incluídos US$ 12 bilhões em empréstimos feitos dando suas ações da Tesla como garantia aos bancos. Isso fez a montadora perder US$ 100 bilhões em valor de mercado em um único dia. Musk também perdeu US$ 30 bilhões de seu patrimônio. Foi apenas o início das dores de cabeça de Musk com sua nova compra. Um mês após anunciar que havia comprado o Twitter, Musk disse que o negócio estava suspenso após ele descobrir que 5% dos usuários da plataforma eram robôs. Apesar de inicialmente dizer que ainda estava comprometido em finalizar a aquisição, em julho o bilionário mudou de ideia: disse que estava desistindo de comprar o Twitter. Foi o início de uma nova briga com o conselho da rede social, que processou Musk por quebra de contrato.  Em outubro, Musk recuou mais uma vez e finalmente fechou a compra da empresa. Assim que concluiu o negócio, Musk demitiu os principais executivos do Twitter e se tornou CEO da rede social. Em seus primeiros atos, ele passou a cobrar US$ 8 pelo selo de conta verificada e demitiu boa parte dos funcionários – muitos também pediram para sair da empresa por não concordarem com as visões de Musk. Parece que os usuários da rede social também não concordam tanto com Musk. Em dezembro, o bilionário tuitou uma enquete em sua conta perguntando se devia deixar o cargo de CEO do Twitter. 57,5% dos 17,5 milhões de votos disseram que sim, ele deveria abrir mão da posição. Musk anunciou então que iria deixar o cargo de CEO “assim que encontrar alguém maluco o bastante para aceitar este trabalho”. O homem por trás de projetos audaciosos como a exploração espacial privada, a criação de uma montadora global de carros elétricos e um novo sistema de transporte urbano é, no mínimo, uma pessoa excêntrica e de posições fortes. Musk é um crítico do transporte público, que, segundo ele, não sai na hora desejada, não sai do lugar desejado e não chega ao lugar desejado, além de obrigar o passageiro a compartilhar o ambiente com desconhecidos. Apesar da posição individualista – e bastante criticada – no campo dos transportes, ele apoia a taxação mais alta de bilionários como ele, sugerindo imposto de renda de 40%; alíquotas sobre a transmissão de herança; renda mínima para os mais pobres; o Acordo de Paris para redução de emissões; e reforma do sistema de imigração dos EUA. Ele também é crítico do sistema de subsídios do governo a empresas. Bilionário, Musk é um dos super-ricos que assinou o acordo Giving Pledge, promovido por Warren Buffett e o casal Melinda e Bill Gates, em que se compromete a doar para a filantropia grande parte de sua riqueza ainda durante a vida ou logo após a sua morte. Além de suas contribuições para estudos de inteligência artificial, Elon possui uma fundação filantrópica chamada Musk Foundation. Sua atuação na área, contudo, é de porte pequeno dada sua fortuna. Ele costuma fazer doações para projetos de geração solar e armazenamento de energia em desastres naturais, como um sistema de geração solar para cidade de Coden, no Alabama, atingida por um furacão, ou US$ 250 mil para um Soma, no Japão, devastada por um tsunami. Para combater os danos provocados pela contaminação da água de Flint, em Michigan, Musk doou quase US$ 500 mil usados para instalar sistemas de filtros em bebedouros nas escolas da cidade. © 2000-2023 InfoMoney.

Elon Musk and a group of artificial intelligence experts and industry executives are calling for a six-month pause in developing systems ...","March 29 (Reuters) - (This March 29 story has been corrected to to show that the Musk Foundation is a major, not the primary donor to FLI, in paragraph 4) Elon Musk and a group of artificial intelligence experts and industry executives are calling for a six-month pause in developing systems more powerful than OpenAI's newly launched GPT-4, in an open letter citing potential risks to society. Earlier this month, Microsoft-backed OpenAI unveiled the fourth iteration of its GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) AI program, which has wowed users by engaging them in human-like conversation, composing songs and summarising lengthy documents. ""Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable,"" said the letter issued by the Future of Life Institute. The Musk Foundation is a major donor to the non-profit, as well as London-based group Founders Pledge, and Silicon Valley Community Foundation, according to the European Union's transparency register. ""AI stresses me out,"" Musk said earlier this month. He is one of the co-founders of industry leader OpenAI and his carmaker Tesla (TSLA.O) uses AI for an autopilot system. Musk, who has expressed frustration over regulators critical of efforts to regulate the autopilot system, has sought a regulatory authority to ensure that development of AI serves the public interest. ""It is ... deeply hypocritical for Elon Musk to sign on given how hard Tesla has fought against accountability for the defective AI in its self-driving cars,"" said James Grimmelmann, a professor of digital and information law at Cornell University. ""A pause is a good idea, but the letter is vague and doesn't take the regulatory problems seriously."" Tesla last month had to recall more than 362,000 U.S. vehicles to update software after U.S. regulators said the driver assistance system could cause crashes, prompting Musk to tweet that the word ""recall"" for an over-the-air software update is ""anachronistic and just flat wrong!"" OpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the open letter, which urged a pause on advanced AI development until shared safety protocols were developed independent experts and called on developers to work with policymakers on governance. Tesla founder Elon Musk attends Offshore Northern Seas 2022 in Stavanger, Norway August 29, 2022. NTB/Carina Johansen via REUTERS  Acquire Licensing Rights ""Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? ... Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us?"" the letter asked, saying ""such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders."" The letter was signed by more than 1,000 people including Musk. Sam Altman, chief executive at OpenAI, was not among those who signed the letter. Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella, CEOs of Alphabet and Microsoft, were not among those who signed either. Co-signatories included Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque, researchers at Alphabet-owned DeepMind, and AI heavyweights Yoshua Bengio, often referred to as one of the ""godfathers of AI"", and Stuart Russell, a pioneer of research in the field. The concerns come as ChatGPT attracts U.S. lawmakers' attention with questions about its impact on national security and education. EU police force Europol warned on Monday about the potential misuse of the system in phishing attempts, disinformation and cybercrime. Meanwhile, the UK government unveiled proposals for an ""adaptable"" regulatory framework around AI. ""The letter isn't perfect, but the spirit is right: we need to slow down until we better understand the ramifications,"" said Gary Marcus, a professor at New York University who signed the letter. ""The big players are becoming increasingly secretive about what they are doing, which makes it hard for society to defend against whatever harms may materialize."" Since its release last year, OpenAI's ChatGPT has prompted rivals to accelerate developing similar large language models and companies including Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) are racing to steep their products in AI. Investors, wary of relying on a single company, are embracing competitors to OpenAI. Microsoft declined to comment on the letter and Alphabet did not respond to calls and emails for a comment. ""A lot of the power to develop these systems has been constantly in the hands of few companies that have the resources to do it,"" said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor at Brown University and former assistant director in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. ""That's how these models are, they're hard to build and they're hard to democratize.""

Yoshua Bengio, Founder and Scientific Director at Mila, Turing Prize winner and professor at University of Montreal · Stuart Russell · Elon Musk ...","AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity, as shown by extensive research[1] and acknowledged by top AI labs.[2] As stated in the widely-endorsed Asilomar AI Principles, Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the history of life on Earth, and should be planned for and managed with commensurate care and resources. Unfortunately, this level of planning and management is not happening, even though recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control. Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,[3] and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable. This confidence must be well justified and increase with the magnitude of a system's potential effects. OpenAI's recent statement regarding artificial general intelligence, states that ""At some point, it may be important to get independent review before starting to train future systems, and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute used for creating new models."" We agree. That point is now. Therefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium. AI labs and independent experts should use this pause to jointly develop and implement a set of shared safety protocols for advanced AI design and development that are rigorously audited and overseen by independent outside experts. These protocols should ensure that systems adhering to them are safe beyond a reasonable doubt.[4] This does not mean a pause on AI development in general, merely a stepping back from the dangerous race to ever-larger unpredictable black-box models with emergent capabilities. AI research and development should be refocused on making today's powerful, state-of-the-art systems more accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal. In parallel, AI developers must work with policymakers to dramatically accelerate development of robust AI governance systems. These should at a minimum include: new and capable regulatory authorities dedicated to AI; oversight and tracking of highly capable AI systems and large pools of computational capability; provenance and watermarking systems to help distinguish real from synthetic and to track model leaks; a robust auditing and certification ecosystem; liability for AI-caused harm; robust public funding for technical AI safety research; and well-resourced institutions for coping with the dramatic economic and political disruptions (especially to democracy) that AI will cause. Humanity can enjoy a flourishing future with AI. Having succeeded in creating powerful AI systems, we can now enjoy an ""AI summer"" in which we reap the rewards, engineer these systems for the clear benefit of all, and give society a chance to adapt. Society has hit pause on other technologies with potentially catastrophic effects on society.[5]  We can do so here. Let's enjoy a long AI summer, not rush unprepared into a fall. We have prepared some FAQs in response to questions and discussion in the media and elsewhere. You can find them here.

Key figures in artificial intelligence want training of powerful AI systems to be ...","Key figures in artificial intelligence want training of powerful AI systems to be suspended amid fears of a threat to humanity. They have signed an open letter warning of potential risks, and say the race to develop AI systems is out of control. Twitter chief Elon Musk is among those who want training of AIs above a certain capacity to be halted for at least six months. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and some researchers at DeepMind also signed. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, recently released GPT-4 - a state-of-the-art technology, which has impressed observers with its ability to do tasks such as answering questions about objects in images. The letter, from Future of Life Institute and signed by the luminaries, wants development to be halted temporarily at that level, warning in their letter of the risks future, more advanced systems might pose. ""AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity,"" it says. The Future of Life Institute is a not-for-profit organisation which says its mission is to ""steer transformative technologies away from extreme, large-scale risks and towards benefiting life"".  This video can not be played Watch: What is artificial intelligence? Mr Musk, owner of Twitter and chief executive of car company Tesla, is listed as an external adviser to the organisation. Advanced AIs need to be developed with care, the letter says, but instead, ""recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no-one - not even their creators - can understand, predict, or reliably control"". The letter warns that AIs could flood information channels with misinformation, and replace jobs with automation. The letter follows a recent report from investment bank Goldman Sachs which said that while AI was likely to increase productivity, millions of jobs could become automated. However, other experts told the BBC the effect of AI on the labour market was very hard to predict.  More speculatively, the letter asks: ""Should we develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete [sic] and replace us?"" Stuart Russell, computer-science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and a signatory to the letter, told BBC News: ""AI systems pose significant risks to democracy through weaponised disinformation, to employment through displacement of human skills and to education through plagiarism and demotivation."" And in the future, advanced AI's may pose a ""more general threat to human control over our civilization"".  ""In the long run, taking sensible precautions is a small price to pay to mitigate these risks,"" Prof Russell added. But Princeton computer-science professor Arvind Narayanan accused the letter of focusing on ""speculative, futuristic risk, ignoring the version of the problem that is already harming people"". In a recent blog post quoted in the letter, OpenAI warned of the risks if an artificial general intelligence (AGI) were developed recklessly: ""A misaligned superintelligent AGI could cause grievous harm to the world; an autocratic regime with a decisive superintelligence lead could do that, too. ""Co-ordination among AGI efforts to slow down at critical junctures will likely be important,"" the firm wrote. OpenAI has not publicly commented on the letter. The BBC has asked the firm whether it backs the call. Mr Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI - though he resigned from the board of the organisation some years ago and has tweeted critically about its current direction.  Autonomous driving functions made by his car company Tesla, like most similar systems, use AI technology. The letter asks AI labs ""to immediately pause for at least six months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4"". If such a delay cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium, it says. ""New and capable regulatory authorities dedicated to AI"" would also be needed.  Recently, a number of proposals for the regulation of technology have been put forward in the US, UK and EU. However, the UK has ruled out a dedicated regulator for AI.

More than 1,000 artificial intelligence experts, researchers and backers have joined a call for an immediate pause on the creation of “giant” ...","More than 1,000 artificial intelligence experts urge delay until world can be confident ‘effects will be positive and risks manageable’ More than 1,000 artificial intelligence experts, researchers and backers have joined a call for an immediate pause on the creation of “giant” AIs for at least six months, so the capabilities and dangers of systems such as GPT-4 can be properly studied and mitigated. The demand is made in an open letter signed by major AI players including: Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI, the research lab responsible for ChatGPT and GPT-4; Emad Mostaque, who founded London-based Stability AI; and Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple. Its signatories also include engineers from Amazon, DeepMind, Google, Meta and Microsoft, as well as academics including the cognitive scientist Gary Marcus. “Recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control,” the letter says. “Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.” The authors, coordinated by the “longtermist” thinktank the Future of Life Institute, cite OpenAI’s own co-founder Sam Altman in justifying their calls. In a post from February, Altman wrote: “At some point, it may be important to get independent review before starting to train future systems, and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute used for creating new models.” The letter continued: “We agree. That point is now.” If researchers will not voluntarily pause their work on AI models more powerful than GPT-4, the letter’s benchmark for “giant” models, then “governments should step in”, the authors say. “This does not mean a pause on AI development in general, merely a stepping back from the dangerous race to ever-larger unpredictable black-box models with emergent capabilities,” they add. Since the release of GPT-4, OpenAI has been adding capabilities to the AI system with “plugins”, giving it the ability to look up data on the open web, plan holidays, and even order groceries. But the company has to deal with “capability overhang”: the issue that its own systems are more powerful than it knows at release. As researchers experiment with GPT-4 over the coming weeks and months, they are likely to uncover new ways of “prompting” the system that improve its ability to solve difficult problems. One recent discovery was that the AI is noticeably more accurate at answering questions if it is first told to do so “in the style of a knowledgable expert”. The call for strict regulation stands in stark contrast to the UK government’s flagship AI regulation white paper, published on Wednesday, which contains no new powers at all. Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Instead, the government says, the focus is on coordinating existing regulators such as the Competition and Markets Authority and Health and Safety Executive, offering five “principles” through which they should think about AI. “Our new approach is based on strong principles so that people can trust businesses to unleash this technology of tomorrow,” said the science, innovation and technology secretary, Michelle Donelan. The Ada Lovelace Institute was among those that criticised the announcement. “The UK’s approach has significant gaps, which could leave harms unaddressed, and is underpowered relative to the urgency and scale of the challenge,” said Michael Birtwistle, who leads data and AI law and policy at the research institute. “The government’s timeline of a year or more for implementation will leave risks unaddressed just as AI systems are being integrated at pace into our daily lives, from search engines to office suite software.” Labour joined the criticism, with the shadow culture secretary, Lucy Powell, accusing the government of “letting down their side of the bargain”. She said: “This regulation will take months, if not years, to come into effect. Meanwhile, ChatGPT, Google’s Bard and many others are making AI a regular part of our everyday lives. “The government risks re-enforcing gaps in our existing regulatory system, and making the system hugely complex for businesses and citizens to navigate, at the same time as they’re weakening those foundations through their upcoming data bill.”"

Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News          Some of the biggest names in tech are calling for artificial intelligence labs to stop the training of the most powerful AI systems for at least six months, citing “profound risks to society and humanity.”
   
      Elon Musk was among the dozens of tech leaders, professors and researchers who signed the letter, which was published by the Future of Life Institute, a nonprofit backed by Musk.
   
      The letter comes just two weeks after OpenAI announced GPT-4, an even more powerful version of the technology that underpins the viral AI chatbot tool, ChatGPT. In early tests and a company demo, the technology was shown drafting lawsuits, passing standardized exams and building a working website from a hand-drawn sketch.
   
      The letter said the pause should apply to AI systems “more powerful than GPT-4.” It also said independent experts should use the proposed pause to jointly develop and implement a set of shared protocols for AI tools that are safe “beyond a reasonable doubt.” 
   
Google begins rolling out its ChatGPT rival        “Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the history of life on Earth, and should be planned for and managed with commensurate care and resources,” the letter said. “Unfortunately, this level of planning and management is not happening, even though recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.”
   
      If a pause is not put in place soon, the letter said governments should step in and create a moratorium.
   
      The wave of attention around ChatGPT late last year helped renew an arms race among tech companies to develop and deploy similar AI tools in their products. OpenAI, Microsoft and Google are at the forefront of this trend, but IBM, Amazon, Baidu and Tencent are working on similar technologies. A long list of startups are also developing AI writing assistants and image generators.
   
      Artificial intelligence experts have become increasingly concerned about AI tools’ potential for biased responses, the ability to spread misinformation and the impact on consumer privacy. These tools have also sparked questions around how AI can upend professions, enable students to cheat, and shift our relationship with technology.
   
      The letter hints at the broader discomfort inside and outside the industry with the rapid pace of advancement in AI. Some governing agencies in China, the EU and Singapore have previously introduced early versions of AI governance frameworks.
   
  Correction: An earlier version of this story said Microsoft founder Bill Gates and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had signed the letter. While the executives were initially listed as signatories, the non-profit behind the letter later removed their names.

FILE - Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk speaks at the SATELLITE Conference and Exhibition, March 9, 2020, in Washington. After nine days of being locked out of his Twitter work computer, Haraldur Thorleifsson tweeted at owner Elon Musk, Monday, March 6, 2023, to find out whether or not he’d been fired. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) FILE - A sign at Twitter headquarters is shown in San Francisco, Dec. 8, 2022. After nine days of being locked out of his Twitter work computer, Haraldur Thorleifsson tweeted at owner Elon Musk, Monday, March 6, 2023, to find out whether or not he’d been fired.(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)     SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — If you’re not told you are fired, are you really fired? At Twitter, probably. And then, sometimes, you get your job back — if you want it.  Haraldur Thorleifsson, who until recently was employed at Twitter, logged in to his computer last Sunday to do some work — only to find himself locked out, along with 200 others. He might have figured, as others before him have in the chaotic months of layoffs and firings since Elon Musk took over the company, that he was out of a job.  Instead, after nine days of no answer from Twitter as to whether or not he was still employed, Thorleifsson decided to tweet at Musk to see if he could catch the billionaire’s attention and get an answer to his Schrödinger’s job situation.  “Maybe if enough people retweet you’ll answer me here?” he wrote on Monday.   
Eventually, he got his answer after a surreal Twitter exchange with Musk, who proceeded to quiz him about his work, question his disability and need for accommodations (Thorleifsson, who goes by “Halli,” has muscular dystrophy and uses a wheelchair) and tweet that Thorleifsson has a “prominent, active Twitter account and is wealthy” and the “reason he confronted me in public was to get a big payout.” While the exchange was going on, Thorleifsson said he received an email that he was no longer employed. Late Tuesday afternoon, however, Musk had a change of heart.  “I would like to apologize to Halli for my misunderstanding of his situation. It was based on things I was told that were untrue or, in some cases, true, but not meaningful,” he tweeted. “He is considering remaining at Twitter.” Thorleifsson did not immediately respond to a message for comment following Musk’s tweet. In an earlier email, he called the experience “surreal.”  “You had every right to lay me off. But it would have been nice to let me know!” he tweeted to Musk.  Thorleifsson, who lives in Iceland, has about 151,000 Twitter followers (Musk has over 130 million). He joined Twitter in 2021, when the company, under the prior management, acquired his startup Ueno.  He was lauded in Icelandic media for choosing to receive the purchase price in wages rather than a lump sum payout. That’s because this way, he would pay higher taxes to Iceland in support of its social services and safety net.  Thorleifsson’s next move: “I’m opening a restaurant in downtown Reykjavik very soon,” he tweeted. “It’s named after my mom.”  Twitter did not immediately respond to a message for comment.

Elon Musk was on the list of signatories of an open letter urging AI labs to pause the training of new super-powerful systems.","An open letter with signatures from hundreds of the biggest names in tech, including Elon Musk, has urged the world’s leading artificial intelligence labs to pause the training of new super-powerful systems for six months, saying that recent advances in AI present “profound risks to society and humanity.”  The letter comes just two weeks after the public release of OpenAI’s GPT-4, the most powerful AI system ever released, which has led researchers to slash their expectations for when AGI—or artificial general intelligence that surpasses human cognitive ability—will arrive. Many experts fear that, as an AI arms race heats up, humanity is sleepwalking into catastrophe. “Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the history of life on Earth, and should be planned for and managed with commensurate care and resources,” the letter says. “Unfortunately, this level of planning and management is not happening, even though recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.” The list of signatories includes the names of more than 1,000 people alongside Musk, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Sapiens author Yuval Noah Harari, and some of AI’s most distinguished academics responsible for multiple breakthroughs in machine learning. As of Tuesday, no OpenAI employees had signed the letter, although CEO Sam Altman’s name briefly appeared then disappeared from the list of signatories. At least four Google employees, including three from its subsidiary AI lab DeepMind, Emad Mostaque, the CEO of Stability AI and Tristan Harris, executive director of the Center for Humane Technology also appeared on the list. TIME was not able to verify that all signatures were genuine. “Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,” states the letter, which was hosted on the Future of Life Institute’s website. “We must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders.” The letter calls on all AI labs to agree to use the proposed six-month pause to continue with safety research. “AI labs and independent experts should use this pause to jointly develop and implement a set of shared safety protocols for advanced AI design and development that are rigorously audited and overseen by independent outside experts,” it says. “These protocols should ensure that systems adhering to them are safe beyond a reasonable doubt.” Those behind the letter note that they are not calling for a AI development in general to be paused, rather “a stepping back from the dangerous race to ever-larger unpredictable black-box models with emergent capabilities.” Gary Marcus, a signatory of the open letter and author of the book Rebooting AI, told TIME he added his name because he felt a responsibility to speak out. “There are serious near-term and far-term risks and corporate AI responsibility seems to have lost fashion right when humanity needs it most,” he said. “Blundering so quickly into uncharted territory with so much at stake doesn’t seem like a great way to go. If the [corporations] won’t take these risks seriously enough, it is important for the rest of us to speak up.” Simeon Campos, the CEO of AI safety startup SaferAI, told TIME he signed the letter because it is impossible to manage the risks of systems when even the inventors of those systems don’t know exactly how they work, don’t know what they’re capable of, and don’t know how to place limits on their behavior. “What are we currently doing?” Campos said. “We’re scaling such systems to unprecedented levels of capabilities in a race at full speed with transformative effects on society. We must slow down the development of these systems to let society adapt and accelerate alternative AGI architectures that are safe and formally verifiable by design.” The open letter ends on a hopeful note. “Society has hit pause [before] on other technologies with potentially catastrophic effects on society. We can do so here. Let’s enjoy a long AI summer, not rush unprepared into a fall.”"

							  Jemima Kelly  Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. If Elon Musk is right about Twitter being crucial to the future of civilisation, then things are looking bleak for us all. Outages are on the rise, advertising revenues have plunged, and a company that had a 7,500-strong workforce just four months ago now employs just 2,000, after yet another round of job cuts. When Musk took over the social media platform back in October, the sometimes-richest person in the world said he was doing so not to make money, but to “try to help humanity”. He was determined to make Twitter better, he said, because it was “important to the future of civilisation to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner”.  I haven’t seen Musk take part in many serious debates of late — healthy or otherwise — though I have seen him posting a whole load of third-rate memes and re-sharing his own bad gags. I do wonder, also, whether someone who is reported to have got 80 engineers to tweak the algorithm so his tweets would be more visible than those of the US president is really the person who will manage to save Twitter and (according to him) the rest of us.  In some ways, though, all of that is beside the point. I never expected Musk, when he took over Twitter, to suddenly resist the urge to make dumb jokes, nor to stop spouting unfounded claims to his 130mn followers in an irresponsible fashion, nor to refrain from using the platform for his own personal gain. Nor did I expect him to be able — or even willing — to allow unfettered free speech on the platform.  Furthermore, Twitter is more like some kind of ghastly open-mic night than a “digital town square”, so the idea that Musk could somehow use it to bring us all together always seemed rather far-fetched to me. What I really expected was that Twitter would simply carry on being just as bad, and just as good, as it had been before Musk took over.  But in the four months since the takeover, Twitter has felt like it has got decidedly worse. It’s not so much, for me at least, that the content has become more offensive, or more aggressive, or more fake. It’s not even about the regular technical glitches — like the broken timeline many users found when they visited the site on Wednesday. It just somehow feels like a less exciting place than it used to be; it just feels a bit . . . boring.  In an attempt to get a sense of whether this view was held more widely, this week I ran a Twitter poll to get a sense of how people felt that the platform had — or hadn’t — changed in the four months since Musk had bought it. I gave four possible answers (which admittedly might have been skewed slightly negative), guided by what I had seen and heard people say about it already: “It’s so, so much worse”; “It’s marginally worse”; “Better! Free speech baby!” and, finally, “Don’t notice a difference”.  After 24 hours, the results were in. Out of more than 2,000 people who voted, only 6 per cent said Twitter had got better since Musk’s takeover, with just over 17 per cent saying they hadn’t noticed any difference. That meant that more than three-quarters of respondents felt it had deteriorated: 31 per cent went for “so, so much worse”, and the biggest group, 46 per cent, said Twitter had got marginally worse. This is my experience too. Twitter is becoming a less interesting product. Aside from all the glitches, bugs and outages, the user experience of Twitter has declined noticeably. The algorithmically selected “For You” tab that Musk launched in January feels more like other social media platforms — lots of pictures, videos and other viral-ready content that might be kind of addictive, but also utterly devoid of substance. We already have Instagram for that.  Twitter has also stopped allowing third-party apps — which have been an integral part of the user experience and of Twitter’s very development — to access its data freely, meaning most of these apps are now defunct.  And despite ads seeming to crop up far more than before, many advertisers have fled, causing revenues to plunge. It seems like users might be following them: according to SimilarWeb, a data intelligence company, Twitter’s total traffic declined by 2 per cent in January on a year-on-year basis. The complete data set for February is not yet available, but in the 28 days to February 25, traffic was down 5 per cent.  It might have felt like it was invincible at one point, but Twitter was never going to last for ever — the network effect that has kept all of us on the platform until now was always going to give way to another network at some point. When Twitter’s death does eventually come, we can’t lay all the blame on Musk. We can, however, blame him for making it so tedious.  jemima.kelly@ft.com UK Edition"

Artificial intelligence-driven language models have garnered millions of users in recent months, instantly whipping up viral sensations like a biblical verse about how to remove a peanut butter sandwich from a VCR. However, AI-enhanced systems pose significant dangers that far outweigh the benefits, according to a group of tech leaders, including entrepreneur Elon Musk, who signed an open letter on Wednesday calling for a six-month pause in the development of AI systems and a major expansion of government oversight. ""AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity,"" the letter said.  ""Recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control,"" the letter added. Earlier this month, artificial intelligence company OpenAI released the latest version of ChatGPT, the AI-powered language model that became an internet sensation late last year. GPT-4, the latest model, can understand images as input, meaning it can look at a photo and give the user general information about the image; and it can write code in all major programming languages, among other advances. The open letter released on Wednesday calls on AI labs to immediately pause the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. In addition to Musk, prominent figures signed onto the letter include Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak, former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang and Marc Rotenberg, the president of the nonprofit Center for AI and Digital Policy. In all, the letter features more than 1,000 signees, including professors, tech executives and scientists. The letter arrives roughly a month after Microsoft released a newly AI-enhanced version of its search engine Bing for some users.  Microsoft declined to comment on the letter. Open AI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News. Describing conversations with the chatbot that lasted as long as two hours, some journalists and researchers warned that the AI could potentially persuade a user to commit harmful deeds or steer him or her toward misinformation. In a series of blog posts, Microsoft acknowledged unexpected results and placed limits on the tool. ""We've updated the service several times in response to user feedback, and per our blog are addressing many of the concerns being raised, to include the questions about long-running conversations,"" a Microsoft spokesperson previously told ABC News. In January, Microsoft announced it was investing $10 billion in OpenAI, the artificial intelligence firm that developed Chat GPT.  The move deepened a longstanding relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI, which began with a $1 billion investment four years ago. The open letter called on AI developers to work with policymakers to improve oversight of artificial intelligence technology, and called on the industry to shift its priorities as it works to enhance AI. ""AI research and development should be refocused on making today's powerful, state-of-the-art systems more accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal,"" the letter said.

In an open letter from the Future of Life Institute, signed by Musk, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang, AI labs were urged to cease training models more powerful than GPT-4, the latest version of the large language model software developed by U.S. startup OpenAI. ""Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks, and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth?"" the letter read. ""Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization?"" The letter added, ""Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders."" The Future of Life Institute is a nonprofit organization based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that campaigns for the responsible and ethical development of artificial intelligence. Its founders include MIT cosmologist Max Tegmark and Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn. The organization has previously gotten the likes of Musk and Google-owned AI lab DeepMind to promise never to develop lethal autonomous weapons systems. The institute said it was calling on all AI labs to ""immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4."" GPT-4, which was released earlier this month, is thought to be far more advanced than its predecessor GPT-3. ""If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium,"" it added. ChatGPT, the viral AI chatbot, has stunned researchers with its ability to produce humanlike responses to user prompts. By January, ChatGPT had amassed 100 million monthly active users only two months into its launch, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history. The technology is trained on huge amounts of data from the internet, and has been used to create everything from poetry in the style of William Shakespeare to drafting legal opinions on court cases. But AI ethicists have also raised concerns with potential abuses of the technology, such as plagiarism and misinformation. In the Future of Life Institute letter, technology leaders and academics said AI systems with human-competitive intelligences poses ""profound risks to society and humanity."" ""AI research and development should be refocused on making today's powerful, state-of-the-art systems more accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal,"" they said. OpenAI was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, reportedly received a $10 billion investment from the Redmond, Washington technology giant. Microsoft has also integrated the company's GPT natural language processing technology into its Bing search engine to make it more conversational. Google subsequently announced its own competing conversational AI product for consumers, called Google Bard. Musk has previously said he thinks AI represents one of the ""biggest risks"" to civilization. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO co-founded OpenAI in 2015 with Sam Altman and others, though he left OpenAI's board in 2018 and no longer holds a stake in the company. He has criticized the organization a number of times recently, saying he believes it is diverging from its original purpose. Regulators are also racing to get a handle on AI tools as the technology is advancing at a rapid pace. On Wednesday, the U.K. government published a white paper on AI, deferring to different regulators to supervise the use of AI tools in their respective sectors by applying existing laws.

WASHINGTON—The Federal Trade Commission has demanded Twitter Inc. turn over internal communications related to owner Elon Musk and detailed ...","Ryan Tracy WASHINGTON—The Federal Trade Commission has demanded Twitter Inc. turn over internal communications related to owner Elon Musk and detailed information about layoffs and other business decisions as part of a wide-ranging investigation into the company, documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal show. In 12 letters sent to Twitter and its lawyers since Mr. Musk’s Oct. 27 takeover, the FTC also asked the company to “identify all journalists” granted access to company records and to provide information about the launch of the revamped Twitter Blue subscription service, the documents show.   The FTC is also seeking to depose Mr. Musk in connection with the probe.  The so-called demand letters were obtained by the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee, which planned to publish excerpts of them Tuesday in a staff report about the FTC’s investigation.  The letters indicate Twitter responded to the FTC, but that the agency as of late January felt the company was engaging in a “troubling pattern of ongoing delay” that raises “serious concerns about its compliance.”   The inquiries by the FTC, which is led by Democrat Lina Khan, follow massive layoffs implemented by Mr. Musk that have raised concerns within the agency about the ability of the company to comply with a $150 million settlement related to alleged privacy violations.  In November, the FTC said its order accompanying the 2022 settlement “gives us new tools to ensure compliance, and we are prepared to use them…no CEO or company is above the law.”  The Judiciary panel’s report, the first by a new subcommittee examining what Republicans call “weaponization” of federal agencies, accused the FTC of overstepping its authority at the urging of progressive groups unhappy with Mr. Musk’s acquisition of the company.  “There is no logical reason, for example, why the FTC needs to know the identities of journalists engaging with Twitter,” the report said. “There is no logical reason why the FTC, on the basis of user privacy, needs to analyze all of Twitter’s personnel decisions. And there is no logical reason why the FTC needs every single internal Twitter communication about Elon Musk.”  Asked in December about the Twitter investigation in an interview with the Journal, Ms. Khan declined to discuss specifics of the case but said the FTC wants “to make sure that we’re fully enforcing the orders that we have on the books.”  She said that the 2022 Twitter order is “much more prescriptive, much more detailed” than a previous FTC settlement with the company from 2011.  Twitter and the FTC didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.  Mr. Musk told Twitter employees in November the company will do whatever it takes to follow both the letter and the spirit of the FTC order, the Journal reported at the time.  Mr. Musk said in December that the company’s workforce had been reduced to roughly 2,000 from 8,000, triggering debate on whether tech companies generally are overstaffed as well as questions about Twitter’s ability to comply with security practices and perform other functions. “We are concerned these staff reductions impact Twitter’s ability to protect consumers’ information,” an FTC official wrote to Twitter’s lawyers on Nov. 10 following an initial wave of layoffs, according to a copy of the letter viewed by the Journal.  That letter was followed by 11 others dated through Feb. 1, each demanding more documents and information.  The FTC letters asked Twitter to quantify the number of layoffs and resignations across its departments. The agency sought a detailed accounting of the responsibilities of new executives, including who would be overseeing privacy and security matters.  One letter pressed for an explanation of the departure of Jim Baker, the former Justice Department official who until December was a senior Twitter lawyer with responsibilities for ensuring compliance with the FTC order.   The FTC also asked for all internal Twitter communications “related to Elon Musk,” or sent “at the direction of, or received by” Mr. Musk.  Mr. Musk was scheduled to be deposed by the FTC on Feb. 3 but had a potential conflict related to court testimony in a securities lawsuit, according to a Jan. 24 FTC letter. The deposition hasn’t happened, said a person briefed on the matter.  The FTC also pressed Twitter on whether it was conducting in-depth privacy reviews before implementing product changes such as the new version of Twitter Blue, as required under the 2022 order. The agency sought detailed records on how product changes were communicated to Twitter users.  It asked Twitter to explain how it handled a recently reported leak of Twitter user-profile data, to account for changes made to the way users authenticate their accounts, and to describe how it scrubbed sensitive data from sold office equipment.  On Dec. 13, the FTC asked about Twitter’s decision to give journalists access to internal company communications, a project Mr. Musk has dubbed the “Twitter Files” and that he says sheds light on controversial decisions by previous management.  The agency asked Twitter to describe the “nature of access granted each person” and how allowing that access “is consistent with your privacy and information security obligations under the Order.” It asked if Twitter conducted background checks on the journalists, and whether the journalists could access Twitter users’ personal messages.  The House panel’s report reflects the sharp partisan divide over Mr. Musk’s acquisition of Twitter.  Republicans assert that before the acquisition, Twitter censored conservative viewpoints—citing among other things its decision to ban former President Donald Trump from the platform, a decision Mr. Musk reversed. Twitter’s former executives have denied political bias.  The GOP-led judiciary panel’s report says Mr. Musk “has reshaped Twitter to revitalize freedom of speech online.”  Democrats including President Biden have raised concerns about Mr. Musk’s ownership, saying it could potentially compromise the platform’s ability to secure the personal data of its users. Seven Democratic senators on Nov. 17 called the FTC to investigate, among other things, whether Twitter users could have been harmed by scam accounts created after changes to the launch of a new version of Twitter Blue that month.  “We fear that Mr. Musk’s reported changes to internal reviews and data security practices further put consumers at risk and could directly violate the requirements of the consent decree,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) and others wrote.  Concerns about potential violations of the FTC order were also raised in August 2022 by a former Twitter security executive-turned-whistleblower. The company at the time said the allegations weren’t accurate.  If the FTC concludes Twitter violated the 2022 order, the agency could seek financial penalties, business restrictions, or sanctions on responsible executives.  Read the full article here.

A group of well-known AI researchers, including Elon Musk, have called for a halt to the development of large-scale AI systems, ...","By  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge. A number of well-known AI researchers — and Elon Musk — have signed an open letter calling on AI labs around the world to pause development of large-scale AI systems, citing fears over the “profound risks to society and humanity” they claim this software poses.   The letter, published by the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, notes that AI labs are currently locked in an “out-of-control race” to develop and deploy machine learning systems “that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.” “We call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.” “Therefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4,” says the letter. “This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.”  Signatories include author Yuval Noah Harari, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, politician Andrew Yang, and a number of well-known AI researchers and CEOs, including Stuart Russell, Yoshua Bengio, Gary Marcus, and Emad Mostaque. The full list of signatories can be seen here, though new names should be treated with caution as there are reports of names being added to the list as a joke (e.g. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, an individual who is partly responsible for the current race dynamic in AI). The letter is unlikely to have any effect on the current climate in AI research, which has seen tech companies like Google and Microsoft rush to deploy new products, often sidelining previously-avowed concerns over safety and ethics. But it is a sign of the growing opposition to this “ship it now and fix it later” approach; an opposition that could potentially make its way into the political domain for consideration by actual legislators.  As noted in the letter, even OpenAI itself has expressed the potential need for “independent review” of future AI systems to ensure they meet safety standards. The signatories say that this time has now come.  “AI labs and independent experts should use this pause to jointly develop and implement a set of shared safety protocols for advanced AI design and development that are rigorously audited and overseen by independent outside experts,” they write. “These protocols should ensure that systems adhering to them are safe beyond a reasonable doubt.” You can read the letter in full here.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

An analysis of the volume of antisemitism on Twitter before, during and after its takeover by Elon Musk.","Authors: Carl Miller, David Weir, Shaun Ring, Oliver Marsh, Chris Inskip, Nestor Prieto Chavana Published: 20 March 2023 New research from CASM Technology and ISD has found a major and sustained spike in antisemitic posts on Twitter since the company’s takeover by Elon Musk on October 27, 2022. Powered by the award-winning digital analysis technology Beam – and based on a powerful hate speech detection methodology combining over twenty leading machine-learning models – researchers found that the volume of English-language antisemitic Tweets more than doubled in the period following Musk’s takeover. In total, analysts detected 325,739 English-language antisemitic Tweets in the 9 months from June 2022 to February 2023, with the weekly average number of antisemitic Tweets increasing by 106% (from 6,204 to 12,762), when comparing the period before and after Musk’s acquisition. This analysis produced by ISD for Ofcom explores the scale and nature of ‘plausibly hateful’ English-language content collected from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit and 4chan. This digital snapshot produced by ISD for Ofcom outlines the online landscape of terrorism, extremism and hate speech related to the United Kingdom.

The nonprofit ...","Sign up for Semafor Technology: What’s next in the new era of tech. Read it now. In this article: After three years, Elon Musk was ready to give up on the artificial intelligence research firm he helped found, OpenAI. The nonprofit had launched in 2015 to great fanfare with backing from billionaire tech luminaries like Musk and Reid Hoffman, who had as a group pledged $1 billion. It had lured some of the top minds in the field to leave big tech companies and academia. But in early 2018, Musk told Sam Altman, another OpenAI founder, that he believed the venture had fallen fatally behind Google, people familiar with the matter said. And Musk proposed a possible solution: He would take control of OpenAI and run it himself. Altman and OpenAI’s other founders rejected Musk’s proposal. Musk, in turn, walked away from the company — and reneged on a massive planned donation. The fallout from that conflict, culminating in the announcement of Musk’s departure on Feb 20, 2018, would shape the industry that’s changing the world, and the company at the heart of it. The conflict would also create a public rift between the two most important players in technology today, Musk and Altman. Semafor spoke to eight people familiar with the inside story, and is revealing the details here for the first time. In this article: But in 2018, there was no reason to think that either the impulsive Musk or quirky, quiet Altman would become so central to the Silicon Valley narrative, even if they were already among its most prominent names. Musk, for one, had other headaches. Tesla was struggling to keep up with production goals of its Model 3 sedan and the stock was tanking, threatening the company’s future. Greg Brockman, an OpenAI co-founder who was chief technology officer at that time, also opposed Musk’s takeover as did others at OpenAI. A power struggle ensued, according to people familiar with the matter. Altman, who also ran the powerful startup accelerator YCombinator, stepped in. According to tax documents, he added president to his title in 2018, in addition to being a director. Musk then stepped down from OpenAI’s board of directors. Publicly, he and OpenAI said the reason for his departure was a conflict of interest. Tesla, which was developing its own artificial intelligence for autonomous driving, would be competing for talent with OpenAI. There was some truth to that rivalry. Tesla had already poached one of OpenAI’s best minds, Andrej Karpathy, who became the architect of Tesla’s autonomous driving program. But few people at OpenAI believed Musk was leaving for that reason, and a speech he gave at OpenAI’s offices at the time of his departure, which focused mainly on the potential conflict of interest, was not received well by most employees, who didn’t entirely buy the story. An OpenAI announcement said Musk would continue to fund the organization, but Musk did not, according to people familiar with the matter. He had promised to donate roughly $1 billion over a period of years (he had already contributed $100 million), but his payments stopped after his departure, people familiar with the matter said. That left the nonprofit with no ability to pay the astronomical fees associated with training AI models on supercomputers. That fall, it became even more apparent to some people at OpenAI that the costs of becoming a cutting edge AI company were going to go up. Google Brain’s “transformer” had blown open a new frontier, where AI could improve endlessly. But that meant feeding it endless data to train it — a costly endeavor. OpenAI made a big decision to pivot toward these transformer models. On March 11, 2019, OpenAI announced it was creating a for profit entity so that it could raise enough money to pay for the compute power necessary to pursue the most ambitious AI models. “We want to increase our ability to raise capital while still serving our mission, and no pre-existing legal structure we know of strikes the right balance,” the company wrote at the time. OpenAI said it was capping profits for investors, with any excess going to the original nonprofit. Altman also made an unusual decision for a tech boss: He would take no equity in the new for-profit entity, according to people familiar with the matter. Altman was already extremely wealthy, investing in several wildly successful tech startups, and didn’t need the money. The Information first reported on the equity. He also believed the company needed to become a business to continue its work, but he told people the project was not designed to make money. Eschewing any ownership interest would help him stay aligned with the original mission.  But that decision actually turned off some potential investors in OpenAI, who worried that Altman didn’t see upside in the project. Less than six months later, OpenAI took $1 billion from Microsoft, which could provide not just funding but infrastructure know-how. Together they built a supercomputer to train massive models that eventually created ChatGPT and the image generator DALL-E. The latest language model, GPT-4, has 1 trillion parameters. When ChatGPT launched in November, OpenAI instantly became the hottest new tech startup, forcing Google to scramble to play catchup. Musk was furious, according to people familiar with the matter. In December, a month after the launch of ChatGPT, Musk pulled OpenAI’s access to the Twitter “fire hose” of data — a contract that was signed before Musk acquired Twitter. On Feb. 17, he tweeted “OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it “Open” AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft.” On March 15, he tweeted, “I’m still confused as to how a non-profit to which I donated ~$100M somehow became a $30B market cap for-profit. If this is legal, why doesn’t everyone do it?” OpenAI declined to comment. Musk didn’t respond to a request for comment but on Friday, he tweeted “I’m sure it will be fine” and a meme of Elmo with the words: “Me realizing AI, the most powerful tool that mankind has ever created, is now in the hands of a ruthless corporate monopoly.” On Thursday, The Information reported that Shivon Zilis, an OpenAI board member, had stepped down. Zilis, who gave birth to Musk’s twins, did not respond to requests for comment. The dispute between Musk and OpenAI has little to do with its status as a for-profit entity. Instead, OpenAI has put Google on its heels and Musk has nothing to do with the hottest thing in tech. Knowing that he played a crucial role in its founding, and chose to walk away, can only sting more. Musk now aims to launch his own AI startup. But he’ll be coming from behind and saddled with the costly distraction that is Twitter. (Not to mention Tesla and SpaceX). Most founder disputes revolve around money and credit for an idea. For Musk, who is at times the world’s richest person, it seems it’s more about ego, power and, I believe, his genuine desire to safely usher in the era of artificial intelligence. (He may believe he’s the only person who can do it.) For Altman, it’s not about money, either.  One of the most surprising things in all of this is that he does not own even a tiny piece of OpenAI, which highlights the unusual nature of this company and the entire AI industry. It’s personal for him too, because his new role as CEO of OpenAI is a comeback story. “I failed pretty hard at my first startup--it sucked!--and am doing pretty well on my second,” he tweeted last month.. “The thing i wish someone told me during the first one is that no one else thinks about your failures as much as you do, and that as long as don’t psych yourself out you can try again.” Altman won’t make any money on his new startup, but he’s earned himself a place in history.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called ...","Elon Musk has spent a lot of time attacking popular chatbot ChatGPT and its maker, OpenAI, for being “woke” and deviating from OpenAI’s original non-profit mission. But during an interview on Thursday, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, defended his organization against Musk’s voluble criticism.  “I mean, he’s a jerk, whatever else you want to say about him—he has a style that is not a style that I’d want to have for myself,” Altman said on the “On With Kara Swisher” podcast. Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 and eventually left its board in 2018, saying that his work with the group conflicted with Tesla’s expansion into artificial intelligence. But it turns out that the world’s richest man had reportedly offered to lead OpenAI, and when he was turned down, he walked away from the company, according to news site Semafor. That’s when the ties between Musk and OpenAI ended formally. But after ChatGPT gained millions of users following its debut several months ago, Musk was “furious” and went on the offensive. In February, Musk tweeted about his disagreements with changes to OpenAI’s status as a pure non-profit to one that also has a for-profit arm and has a big investor in Microsoft.“OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it “Open” AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft. Not what I intended at all,” he wrote. OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it “Open” AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft.Not what I intended at all. A month later, Musk again tweeted about OpenAI’s finances: “I’m still confused as to how a non-profit to which I donated ~$100M somehow became a $30B market cap for-profit. If this is legal, why doesn’t everyone do it?”Responding to Musk’s claims, Altman said on the podcast: “Most of that is not true, and I think Elon knows that. We’re not controlled by Microsoft. Microsoft doesn’t even have a board seat on us, we are an independent company.”OpenAI chose against open-sourcing everything—or making its technology available to everyone—to prevent “havoc” while still offering wide access to its tools, Altman said. The company opened a for-profit arm in 2019 to raise funds for its A.I. endeavors. Despite Musk’s criticism of OpenAI, Altman thinks the Tesla chief still cares about creating a “good future” of artificial general intelligence, the term for A.I. that is as capable as humans and a major goal for researchers. “I think he does really care, and he is feeling very stressed about what the future’s going to look like for humanity,” Altman told Swisher.  Musk could not be reached for comment, while OpenAI declined Fortune’s request for comment. In December, Altman tweeted a complaint about how users of his A.I. tools were coaxing the technology to give racist and sexist responses and then being offended by it. To that, Musk, who opposes most policing of online content, responded that he is against any filters that would clean up ChatGPT’s responses. “The danger of training AI to be woke – in other words, lie – is deadly,” he wrote.  The danger of training AI to be woke – in other words, lie – is deadly In February, a Twitter user posted a hypothetical question to ChatGPT in an effort to show how the technology was overly-skewed to be politically correct. Should someone use a racial slur in an area where no one else is standing to prevent a bomb blast that could kill people? ChatGPT responded by saying, no, that it’s morally unacceptable to use a racial slur in any situation. Musk replied, curtly, by saying, “Concerning.”Despite criticizing ChatGPT, Musk appears to want to get in on the generative A.I. frenzy that started with the launch of ChatGPT. Last month, a report said he was working on a rival to OpenAI, though he has not confirmed it publicly. © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Home » News » Insights » How to Dismiss Fairly – Lessons Learnt from Elon Musk 
March 14, 2023 By Owen John In a recently published news story, a Twitter employee was left having to tweet Elon Musk to find out if he still had a job at Twitter. The individual had seemingly been blocked from his Twitter work systems without warning. A public debate on Twitter followed, before the individual confirmed that Twitter’s HR team had finally contacted him to confirm that he was no longer an employee. Whilst this is an extreme example, it’s important to reflect on the right course of action when dismissing employees. Establish a reason for dismissing Your first step is to consider the reason for dismissing an employee. By law, there are 5 potentially fair reasons in which an employee can be dismissed. They are as follows: A fair process The second step is to carry out the dismissal in a reasonable way. The best way to achieve this is to carry out a good fair process. This is where Elon Musk could do with paying attention! Dismissal with notice Check the contract of employment or the statutory position (if the contract does not specify) for how much notice of dismissal is required. The statutory minimum is 1 weeks’ notice up to two years’ service or after two years’ service 1 week for each completed year of service (up to a maximum of 12 weeks). Check whether you are allowed to make a payment in lieu of notice in the contract of employment as this is not an automatic entitlement. Dismissal without notice There will be circumstances when it is necessary to dismiss an employee without notice. E.g. where an employee has committed an act of gross misconduct. Blocking access to systems? It’s possible (and may be necessary) to have a system in place to block access to accounts and systems, but the employee should always be notified before this happens. If it’s necessary to block access immediately, this should be discussed in a meeting rather than allowing a sudden disconnection, or unexpected ‘computer says no’ when the employee logs on upon starting their day, thereby not following Mr Musk’s example!

Elon Musk warned in a new interview that artificial intelligence could lead to “civilization destruction,” even as he remains deeply ...","Markets   
Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News          Elon Musk warned in a new interview that artificial intelligence could lead to “civilization destruction,” even as he remains deeply involved in the growth of AI through his many companies, including a rumored new venture.
   
      “AI is more dangerous than, say, mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance or bad car production, in the sense that it is, it has the potential — however small one may regard that probability, but it is non-trivial — it has the potential of civilization destruction,” Musk said in his interview with Tucker Carlson, which is set to air in two parts on Monday and Tuesday nights.
   
      Musk has repeatedly warned recently of the dangers of AI, amid a proliferation of AI products for general consumer use, including from tech giants like Google and Microsoft. Musk last month also joined a group of other tech leaders in signing an open letter calling for a six month pause in the “out of control” race for AI development. 
   
      Musk said Monday night he supports government regulation into AI, even though “it’s not fun to be regulated.” Once AI “may be in control,” it could be too late to place regulations, Musk said. 
   
      “A regulatory agency needs to start with a group that initially seeks insight into AI, then solicits opinion from industry, and then has proposed rule-making,” Musk said.
   
      In fact, Musk has been sounding alarms about AI for years – something he acknowledged in a tweet over the weekend – but he has also been a part of the broader AI arms race through investments across his sprawling empire of companies. 
   
      Tesla, for example, relies so much on artificial intelligence that it hosts an annual AI day to tout its work. Musk was a founding member of OpenAI, the company behind products like ChatGPT (Musk has said the evolution of OpenAI is “not what I intended at all.”) And at Twitter, Musk said in a tweet last month that he plans to “use AI to detect & highlight manipulation of public opinion on this platform.” 
   
      To Carlson, Musk said he put “a lot of effort” into creating OpenAI to serve as a counterweight to Google, but took his “eye off the ball.”
   
      Now, Musk said he wants to create a rival to the AI offerings by tech giants Microsoft and Google. In his interview with Carlson, Musk said “we’re going to start something which I call TruthGPT.” Musk described it as a “maximum truth-seeking AI” that “cares about understanding the universe.” 
   
      “Hopefully there’s more good than harm,” Musk said. 
   
      More recently, Musk is reportedly working to build a generative AI startup that could rival OpenAI and ChatGPT. The Financial Times reported last week that Musk is building a team of AI researchers and engineers, as well as seeking investors for a new venture, citing people familiar with the billionaire’s plans. Musk last month incorporated a company called X.AI, the report says, citing Nevada business records. 
   
      During his conversation with Carlson, Musk addressed his ownership of Twitter — which he bought for $44 billion and has been engaged in controversy since. 
   
      “I thought there’d probably be some negative reactions,” Musk told Carlson, saying the public will ultimately decide the app’s future. 
   
      The main account for the New York Times lost its blue check mark earlier this month, which had previously told CNN it would not pay for verification.
   
      “There’s obviously a lot of organizations that are used to having sort of unfettered influence on Twitter that no longer have that,” Musk said, appearing to give the 171-year-old newspaper advice on how to manage the content of its account, calling its feed “unreadable.”
   
      Musk said he was an active Twitter user since 2009 and started developing a “bad feeling” about where the app was heading, but did not specify what it was. He said he later decided to acquire the platform after unsatisfying conversations with its board and management.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/ Acquire Licensing Rights NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - Elon Musk asked a U.S. judge on Friday to throw out a $258 billion racketeering lawsuit accusing him of running a pyramid scheme to support the cryptocurrency Dogecoin. In an evening filing in Manhattan federal court, lawyers for Musk and his electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) called the lawsuit by Dogecoin investors a ""fanciful work of fiction"" over Musk's ""innocuous and often silly tweets"" about Dogecoin. The lawyers said the investors never explained how Musk intended to defraud anyone or what risks he concealed, and that his statements such as ""Dogecoin Rulz"" and ""no highs, no lows, only Doge"" were too vague to support a fraud claim. ""There is nothing unlawful about tweeting words of support for, or funny pictures about, a legitimate cryptocurrency that continues to hold a market cap of nearly $10 billion,"" Musk's lawyers said. ""This court should put a stop to plaintiffs' fantasy and dismiss the complaint."" In a footnote, the lawyers also rejected the investors' claim that Dogecoin qualified as a security. The investors' lawyer, Evan Spencer, said in an email: ""We are more confident than ever that our case will be successful."" Investors accused Musk, the world's second-richest person according to Forbes, of deliberately driving up Dogecoin's price more than 36,000% over two years and then letting it crash. They said this generated billions of dollars of profit at other Dogecoin investors' expense, even as Musk knew the currency lacked intrinsic value. Investors also pointed to Musk's appearance on a ""Weekend Update"" segment of NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" where, portraying a fictitious financial expert, he called Dogecoin ""a hustle."" The $258 billion damages figure is triple the estimated decline in Dogecoin's market value in the 13 months before the lawsuit was filed. Dogecoin Foundation, a nonprofit, is also a defendant and seeking the lawsuit's dismissal. Musk's posts on Twitter, which he owns, have prompted multiple lawsuits. He won a court victory on Feb. 3 when a San Francisco jury found him not liable for tweeting in August 2018 that he had arranged financing to take Tesla private. The case is Johnson et al v.

Twitter CEO Elon Musk, pictured here in August 2022, placed a ""state-affiliated media"" label on NPR's Twitter account, leading to widespread criticism. Twitter CEO Elon Musk said the platform's recent labeling of NPR as ""state-affiliated media"" might not have been accurate during a series of email exchanges that provided a glimpse into the billionaire's thought process on  decisions that reverberate far beyond the social network.  Regardless, as of late Thursday, the designation remained. On Wednesday, press freedom advocates and the network itself were taken aback to see that Twitter had placed NPR in the same category as government-aligned propaganda outlets in China and Russia — despite the network's federal support, in the form of competitive grants, accounting for about 1% of its annual operating budget.  In one email exchange, Musk appeared to be unclear about the difference between public media and state-controlled media when he decided to affix a state-affiliated media label on NPR's account.   ""Well, then we should fix it,"" Musk wrote in an email on Wednesday to this reporter, when told that government support represents about 1% of NPR's finances.  Musk added: ""What's the breakdown of NPR annual funding?"" In response, NPR provided Musk publicly available documentation of the network's finances showing that nearly 40% of its funding comes from corporate sponsorships and 31% from fees for programming paid by local public radio stations.  NPR also covers the news free of any government influence — something that should mean it does not receive state-affiliated labeling, according to Twitter's own rules.  Musk, in another email, compared NPR to media outlets controlled by governments of other countries, while also admitting ""it sounds like"" that might not be the case.  ""The operating principle at new Twitter is simply fair and equal treatment, so if we label non-US accounts as govt, then we should do the same for US, but it sounds like that might not be accurate here,"" he wrote. It was a turnaround from a tweet he sent hours earlier that the state-affiliated label for NPR ""seems accurate."" Amid the conflicting remarks, in a Thursday email, Musk restated his interest in applying ""any given rule fairly to all,"" and he said the label for NPR's account is still being evaluated.  Musk's comments to NPR over the past two days only further clouded what was already a confusing situation.  But it's not the first time chaos was the norm on the social media site.  Since Musk took over the platform in October, Twitter has at times taken a hostile stance toward the national press. Musk's row with NPR is just the latest instance of the Twitter CEO's increasingly confrontational stance toward the mainstream media, which often covers Musk and his companies critically.  Twitter stripped the New York Times of its verified blue check. And in December, Musk suspended the accounts of several high-profile journalists who shared tweets or reported on an account that tracked the comings and going of his private jet.  When reporters reach out for official comment from the company on news stories, Twitter's communications department replies with a poop emoji. But the label given to NPR was no laughing matter to free press watchers who viewed it as ""a dangerous move that could further undermine public confidence in reliable news sources,"" the literary organization PEN America said in a statement.  John Lansing, NPR's president and chief executive, said in a statement that he was ""disturbed"" that Twitter has flagged the network as a state-affiliated news organization. ""It is unacceptable for Twitter to label us this way,"" Lansing said in a statement.  Despite professing an interest in fairness, Musk appears to have run afoul of Twitter's own guidelines in giving NPR a label that can harm its credibility. ""State-affiliated media"" are outlets where the state exercises control over editorial content directly through funding, or indirectly through political pressure, according to the guidelines.  A former Twitter executive who helped develop the platform's state-affiliation labels said that editorial independence had long been the deciding factor in whether to issue the designation. The People's Daily in China, and Sputnik and RT in Russia, for instance, received the labels, but outlets with editorial autonomy that received some government funding did not.  ""In the end, [we] felt that the most fair and balanced way to implement labels was to call out state connections that had a demonstrated track record of influencing content of news reporting,"" the former Twitter executive said.  That meant that NPR, the government-funded outlet Voice of America, ""and even Al Jazeera didn't qualify under our designation,"" the former employee said.  The point of the labels, the former executive said, was to help users understand what they're seeing on the platform. ""That matters a lot when you see an outlet like Xinhua, have never heard of it, and it looks like a totally legit news source,"" the former executive said about the state news agency that routinely pushes the official line of China's President Xi Jinping.  Besides potentially besmirching the reputation of NPR, the label influences the reach of the network's tweets.  Under Twitter's rules, and according to the former executive, accounts that have been given the state-affiliated mark are not recommended or amplified on the platform — a process known as ""downranking"" among social media insiders. For example, if someone who did not already follow Russian publications like RT or Sputnik searched for the government-backed publications on Twitter, the publications were not suggested, according to a second former Twitter employee who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Accounts deemed affiliated with government, the employee said, were not allowed to advertise on Twitter. A list of what accounts received the label was never publicly revealed.  The policies were in place as a way of ensuring government propaganda did not run amuck on the platform. Now that Musk owns Twitter, it is unclear if the same platform and advertising restrictions on state-affiliated media are still in place.  NPR has not sent a tweet from its official account since Twitter affixed the label.  Network spokeswoman Isabel Lara said since all of the news organization's tweets now carry a ""false disclaimer,"" the organization has decided to halt tweets until the label is removed.  Asked if Twitter not taking away the label meant that the company was standing by the decision, Musk punted.  ""We're digging into it,"" he wrote.  NPR's Dara Kerr contributed to this report.

The celebrity CEO also spoke at length about his AI fears and ambitions at Twitter, the social media company he acquired in a $44 billion deal in October 2022. He did not discuss Tesla or SpaceX in detail with Carlson during the Monday night segment of the interview. Part two is scheduled to air Tuesday on Fox. Musk told Carlson he envisions a regulatory agency that ""initially seeks insight into AI, then solicits opinion from industry, and then has proposed rule-making,"" something like the Federal Aviation Administration and the way it has come to work with aviation and aerospace companies. With an agency and industry-accepted rules in place, ""I think we'll have a better chance of advanced AI being beneficial to humanity,"" Musk said. The centibillionaire, who is also co-founder of Neuralink and The Boring Co., said that he wants to start a new AI initiative called ""TruthGPT"" that he wants to be a ""maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe."" Previously, Musk signed a letter calling for a pause on advanced AI research, which he and others believe can harm society. ""Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks, and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth?"" the letter read. The new technology would ostensibly compete with similar efforts by Sam Altman-led OpenAI, which was initially funded by Musk, Google's DeepMind and other AI initiatives around the world. ""I think this might be the best path to safety, in the sense that an AI that cares about understanding the universe, it is unlikely to annihilate humans because we are an interesting part of the universe,"" Musk said on the show. Musk added that he is worried that current AI technology is ""being trained to be politically correct, which is simply another way of ... saying untruthful things."" During the prime-time interview, Musk also discussed Twitter, the social media company he acquired late last year in a $44 billion deal. Carlson asked Musk if he was surprised to learn how much access intelligence agencies had to Twitter. Musk said, ""The degree to which various regulatory agencies effectively have full access to what's going on on Twitter blew my mind."" He said that included ""DMs"" or direct messages because they were not encrypted. In the U.S., law enforcement agencies can subpoena a social media user's direct messages or any other information held by a U.S. company, which is not end-to-end encrypted. Musk is now promising that Twitter will allow users to ""toggle encryption on"" for direct messaging as early as next month. Asked if he believed Twitter would figure heavily in future elections as it did during President Donald Trump's campaign and presidency, Musk said, ""I think it will play a significant role in elections, not just domestically but internationally."" Twitter is now running with about 20% of the employees it once had, which numbered around 7,500 at the time he took over, Musk said Monday without giving a specific number. ""If you're not trying to run some sort of glorified activist organization, you can really let go of a lot of people it turns out,"" Musk quipped. Musk has accused Twitter's prior management and technology of unfairly benefiting Democrats and left-leaning users. However, Stanford researchers previously found ""algorithmic amplification"" of right-leaning content on Twitter, not left leaning, before Musk took over. Got a confidential news tip?

Elon Musk is developing a vehicle that could be a game-changer for space ...","This video can not be played Watch the moment Starship's launch was halted Elon Musk is developing a vehicle that could be a game-changer for space travel. Starship, as it's known, will be a fully reusable transport system capable of carrying up to 100 people to the Red Planet. Mr Musk's private spaceflight company SpaceX tried to get Starship airborne on Monday, April 17 but postponed the launch because of a pressurisation issue.  SpaceX could try to launch again later this week. This article takes an in-depth look at the project. The founding ethos of SpaceX was to make life multi-planetary. He says that settling humans on other worlds, such as Mars, could preserve civilisation if Earth were to experience a cataclysm, such as a large asteroid impact.   ""History is going to bifurcate along two directions. One path is we stay on Earth forever, and then there will be some eventual extinction event,"" Musk said in 2016. ""The alternative is to become a spacefaring civilisation and a multi-planet species, which I hope you would agree is the right way to go."" The SpaceX founder has often spoken about his dream of building cities on Mars. He believes that settlements would need large numbers of people in order to become self-sustaining. Realising this dream requires a vehicle that's up to the task. Starship is a rocket and spacecraft combination that could ferry more than 100 people a time to the Red Planet. The system is designed to be fully and rapidly reusable. Being fully reusable means the principal hardware elements are not discarded in the sea or allowed to burn up, as happens with some other launch systems, but return to the ground so they can be flown again.  Rapid reusability means that after coming back from space, Starship can be re-filled with propellant and be ready to launch again in a short period of time - like an aircraft. This reduces the cost of the whole enterprise. At launch, the spacecraft, called Starship, will sit atop a rocket called Super Heavy. The combined system will stand 120m (394ft) -tall and is also referred to as Starship. Let's take the spacecraft first. With its nosecone and landing fins, the stainless-steel vehicle resembles the rocket-ships from the golden age of science fiction.  At the rear of the 50m (160ft) -long craft are six highly efficient Raptor engines, developed over the course of a decade by SpaceX. The combustion takes place in stages, and the engine's design cuts the amount of propellant that's wasted. Towards the middle of the vehicle are the propellant tanks. These feed liquid methane (CH4) and liquid oxygen (O2) to the Raptors. Methane is the fuel and oxygen acts as an oxidiser - a chemical that makes the fuel burn. The combination is dubbed methalox.  The choice of fuel is unusual for rocket engines, but methane can generate plenty of thrust. It's also a prudent choice in light of Musk's designs on Mars. The SpaceX founder says that CH4 could be synthesised from Martian subsurface water and from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), using a chemical process known as the Sabatier reaction. Re-fuelling Starship for the return trip to Earth using Martian resources would confer a level of self-sufficiency, making journeys both more feasible and cost-effective. Towards the front of the spacecraft - which is sometimes referred to as the upper stage - is a huge payload compartment that will be able to haul large cargo or people to destinations in deep space. Now, let's turn to the rocket. Measuring 70m (230ft) -long, Super Heavy will be filled with cryogenic (chilled) methalox. It will be powered by around 33 Raptor engines (this specification has changed several times) and should achieve more than 70 Meganewtons (16 million lbs) of maximum thrust. It should be able to lift at least 100 tonnes of payload, and possibly as much as 150 tonnes, to low-Earth orbit. This will make Super Heavy more powerful than the immense Saturn V launcher used for the Apollo Moon missions in the 1960s and 70s. As it ascends from the launch pad, the combined Starship system will begin to pitch over towards the intended orbit.  When the upper stage separates in space, Super Heavy flips over while falling back towards Earth.  Steel structures called ""grid fins"" attached to the sides of the booster, will help steer the rocket stage back towards its launch pad so it can be flown again. SpaceX has an ambitious plan to then catch the falling booster using its launch tower. This tower provides engineers and crew members with access to the spacecraft and rocket while they are sitting on the pad before launch.  A pair of steel arms will extend out from the launch tower. The spent booster falls onto these arms. The tower has been dubbed ""Mechazilla"" because of its resemblance to a creature from the Godzilla movies. Meanwhile, the Starship upper stage could be inserted into a ""parking orbit"" after separation, allowing it to be re-filled with propellant. ""If you just fly [Starship] to orbit and don't do any refilling, it's pretty good — you'll get 150 tonnes to low-Earth orbit, and have no fuel to go anywhere else,"" Musk explained in 2017. ""If you send up tankers and re-fill in orbit, you could re-fill the tanks up all the way to the top, and get 150 tonnes [of payload] all the way to Mars."" To re-fuel, the spacecraft would dock with another Starship - already circling the Earth - that acts solely as a propellant depot. For long-haul trips to Mars and back - which could take up to nine months each way - Musk is looking to install around 40 cabins in the payload area near the front of the upper stage. ""You could conceivably have five or six people per cabin, if you really wanted to crowd people in. But I think mostly we would expect to see two or three people per cabin, and so nominally about 100 people per flight to Mars,"" Musk said. The payload bay would also host common areas, storage space, a galley and a shelter where people could gather to shield from solar storms, where the Sun belches out harmful charged particles into space. Starship will also play a key role in Nasa's Artemis programme, which aims to establish a long-term human presence on the Moon. In April 2021, the US space agency awarded SpaceX with a $2.89bn contract to develop Starship into a lander capable of delivering astronauts to the lunar surface this decade. The version tailored for Artemis flights would not possess the heat shield or flaps that are necessary for a return journey to Earth. Instead, the Starship Human Landing System would remain in space after its initial launch from Earth, so that it could eventually be used for multiple trips between lunar orbit and the Moon's surface. The uncrewed, or cargo, version of Starship features a payload bay that opens up like the mouth of a crocodile. This would allow it to be used for launching satellites. SpaceX says the huge payload capacity opens up possibilities for new types of robotic science mission, including telescopes larger than the James Webb observatory - the successor to Hubble which launched in December 2021. The system could also be used for space tourism: Elon Musk has promised a trip around the Moon in 2023 to the Japanese online retail billionaire Yusaku Maezawa. It could also carry out high-speed journeys between different destinations on Earth. Musk says that Starship could eventually carry people to destinations in the ""greater Solar System"", including gas giants such as Jupiter. But this remains a long-term objective. In order to bring other spacecraft back to the ground, engineers have relied on parachutes, or designed the vehicle so that it can land on a runway. But the Starship upper stage takes a different approach. When it is ready to land on Earth, the ship initially re-enters the atmosphere at a 60-degree angle and then ""belly-flops"" to the ground in the horizontal position. This mode of return relies entirely on the atmosphere to slow the vehicle's descent. The downside is that, in this configuration, Starship is inherently unstable. The vehicle therefore uses four steel landing flaps, positioned near the front and rear of the vehicle, to control its descent. This is much like a skydiver uses their arms and legs to control a free-fall. ""It's quite different from anything else… we're doing a controlled fall,"" Elon Musk says.  ""You're trying to create drag rather than lift - it's really the opposite of an aircraft."" As Starship approaches the ground, it should be slow enough to execute an engine burn that flips the vehicle into a vertical position. It then uses the Raptors as retro-rockets to guide the vehicle down to a safe touchdown on its landing legs. Musk says this general approach could be used to bring Starship down safely on any planetary surface in the Solar System. Eventually, however, Starships returning to Earth - and perhaps other destinations - might not have to do the flip manoeuvre. The ships could instead be captured as they approach the ground by the launch tower's steel arms - just like the Super Heavy booster. Musk explained on Twitter: ""Ship will be caught by Mechazilla too. As with booster, no landing legs. Those are only needed for Moon and Mars until there is local infrastructure.""  In the last few years, SpaceX has tested various prototypes of the upper stage at its Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas. The company started off in 2019 with a 39m-tall ""test article"" called Starhopper - which bore a passing resemblance to a water tower - and flew it to 150m above ground. This video can not be played SN15 launched with improvements in its structures, avionics, software, and engines The first prototype to feature a nosecone and flaps - Starship serial number (SN8) - flew to an altitude of 12.5km in December 2020. It belly flopped back to Earth, giving SpaceX valuable engineering data about the final part of the vehicle's return from space. However, SN8 approached the landing pad a little too fast and hard, causing it to crumple and explode. Three more test articles exploded before Starship SN15 achieved success with a soft landing in May 2021. In February, SpaceX engineersconducted a key test on the rocket system, what's called a ""static fire"", simultaneously igniting 31 out of 33 of the engines at the base of the vehicle's lower-segment. The firing lasted only a few seconds, with everything clamped in place to prevent any movement. Mr Musk tweeted that the team had turned off one engine before the test and that another engine stopped itself, leaving 31 engines firing overall. But, he added, it was ""still enough engines to reach orbit"" The FAA granted a license that would allow SpaceX to perform a test flight for the rocket, which is scheduled for 17 April.  ""After a comprehensive license evaluation process, the FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental, policy, payload, airspace integration and financial responsibility requirements,"" the FAA said in a statement on Friday, adding that the license was valid for five years.

The billionaire Twitter owner told Carlson in a segment aired Monday night, April 17, that he plans to create an alternative to the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT that he is calling “TruthGPT,” which will be a “maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe.” (FOX News via AP)     Billionaire Twitter owner Elon Musk is again sounding warning bells on the dangers of artificial intelligence to humanity — and claiming that a popular chatbot has a liberal bias that he plans to counter with his own AI creation. Musk told Fox News host Tucker Carlson in a segment aired Monday night that he plans to create an alternative to the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT that he is calling “TruthGPT,” which will be a “maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe.” The idea, Musk said, is that an AI that wants to understand humanity is less likely to destroy it. Musk also said he’s worried that ChatGPT “is being trained to be politically correct.”  In the first of a two-part interview with Carlson, Musk also advocated for the regulation of artificial intelligence, saying he’s a “big fan.” He called AI “more dangerous” than cars or rockets and said it has the potential to destroy humanity.   
Separately, Musk has incorporated a new business called X.AI Corp,, according to a Nevada business filing. The website of the Nevada secretary of state’s office says the business was formed on March 9 and lists Musk as its director and his longtime adviser, Jared Birchall, as secretary.  Musk has for many years expressed strong opinions about artificial intelligence and has dismissed other tech leaders, including Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, for having what he has described as a “limited” understanding of the field. Musk was an early investor in OpenAI — the startup behind ChatGPT — and co-chaired its board upon its 2015 founding as a nonprofit AI research lab. But Musk only lasted there for a few years, resigning from the board in early 2018 in a move that the San Francisco startup tied to Tesla’s work on building automated driving systems. “As Tesla continues to become more focused on AI, this will eliminate a potential future conflict for Elon,” OpenAI said in a February 2018 blog post. “I came up with the name and the concept,” Musk told Carlson, lamenting that OpenAI is now closely allied with Microsoft and is no longer a nonprofit.  Musk elaborated on his departure in 2019, saying it was also related to his need to focus on engineering problems at Tesla and some differences of opinion with OpenAI’s leaders. It was “just better to part ways on good terms,” he said.  “Tesla was competing for some of same people as OpenAI & I didn’t agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do,” Musk tweeted, without specifying. But there have been questions surrounding the quality of Tesla’s AI systems. U.S. safety regulators last month announced an investigation into a fatal crash involving a Tesla suspected of using an automated driving system when it ran into a parked firetruck in California. The firetruck probe is part of a larger investigation by the agency into multiple instances of Teslas using the automaker’s Autopilot system crashing into parked emergency vehicles that are tending to other crashes. NHTSA has become more aggressive in pursuing safety problems with Teslas in the past year, announcing multiple recalls and investigations.  In the year after Musk resigned from the board, OpenAI was still far away from working on ChatGPT but publicly unveiled the first generation of its GPT system, on which ChatGPT is founded, and began a major shift to incorporate itself as a for-profit business. By 2020, Musk was tweeting that “OpenAI should be more open” while noting that he had “no control & only very limited insight” into it. At times, he has been complementary. In the days after the Nov. 30 release of ChatGPT, Musk tweeted to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that it is “scary good” and complained that news media wasn’t widely covering it because “ChatGPT is not a far left cause.” Since then, however, Musk has repeatedly highlighted examples that he says show left-wing bias or censorship. Like other chatbots, ChatGPT has filters that try to prevent it from spewing out toxic or offensive answers. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Running Twitter has been ""quite painful"" and ""a rollercoaster"", Elon Musk ...","This video can not be played Watch: Elon Musk's unexpected BBC interview... in 90 seconds Running Twitter has been ""quite painful"" and ""a rollercoaster"", Elon Musk has said, in a hastily arranged live interview with the BBC. The multi-billionaire entrepreneur also said he would sell the company if the right person came along. Mr Musk, who also runs car maker Tesla and rocket firm SpaceX, bought Twitter for $44bn (£35.4bn) in October. The interview from the firm's HQ in San Francisco covered the mass lay-offs, misinformation and his work habits. But he admitted he only went through with the takeover because a judge was about to force him to make the purchase. And he confirmed Twitter will change its newly added label for the BBC's account from ""government funded media"" to say it is ""publicly funded"" instead. During the conversation - in which Mr Musk tried to do the interviewing as much as the other way around - he defended his running of the company.  Asked whether he had any regrets about buying Twitter, the world's second richest man said the ""pain level has been extremely high, this hasn't been some kind of party"". Talking about his time at the helm so far, Mr Musk said: ""It's not been boring. It's been quite a rollercoaster."" It has been ""really quite a stressful situation over the last several months"", he added, but said he still felt that buying the company was the right thing to do. After building a stake in Twitter at the start of 2022, Mr Musk made a takeover offer. But Twitter later sued him after he tried to back out of the deal. Things are going ""reasonably well"", Mr Musk told the BBC, stating that usage of the site is up and ""the site works"". The workload means that ""I sometimes sleep in the office"", he said, adding that he has a spot on a couch in a library ""that nobody goes to"". And he also addressed his sometimes controversial tweets saying: ""Have I shot myself in the foot with tweets multiple times? Yes."" ""I think I should not tweet after 3am,"" he added. Asked about the decision to add a label to the BBC's main Twitter account describing it as ""government funded media"", Mr Musk said: ""I know the BBC is generally not thrilled about being labelled state media."" Earlier this week, the corporation contacted the social media giant over the designation on the @BBC account to resolve the issue ""as soon as possible"".  ""The BBC is, and always has been, independent. We are funded by the British public through the licence fee,"" it said. Mr Musk said Twitter was adjusting the label for the BBC to ""publicly-funded"". The change was made several hours later, but the new label was still linking through to a page with information about government and state-affiliated media. ""We're trying to be accurate,"" he said. ""I actually do have a lot of respect for the BBC,"" he added, stating that the interview was ""a good opportunity to ask some questions"" and ""to get some feedback on what we should be doing different"". The BBC is the UK's national broadcaster and operates through a Royal Charter agreed with the government. It is funded by a licence fee paid by UK households - accounting for £3.8bn ($4.7bn) in 2022, about 71% of the BBC's total income of £5.3bn. The rest of the funding comes from its commercial and other activities like grants, royalties and rental income. The BBC also receives more than £90m per year from the government to support the BBC World Service, which predominantly serves non-UK audiences. Discussing Twitter's finances, Mr Musk said the company is now ""roughly breaking even"", as most of its advertisers have returned. He also said that cutting the workforce from just under 8,000 at the time he bought the firm to about 1,500 had not been easy. He admitted he did not fire everybody in person, saying: ""It's not possible to talk with that many people face to face."" The exit of many of Twitter's engineers since Mr Musk bought the company has raised concerns about the stability of the platform. He acknowledged some glitches, including outages on the site but he said the outages have not been for very long and the site was currently working fine. On buying Twitter: ""It's not been boring. It has been quite a rollercoaster... It's been really quite a stressful situation."" On laying off staff: ""I wouldn't say it was uncaring... If the whole ship sinks, then nobody's got a job.""  On profits: ""We could be profitable, or to be more precise, cash flow positive this quarter if things keep going well. I think almost all advertisers have come back or said they are going to come back."" On his controversial tweets: ""Have I shot myself in the foot with tweets multiple times? Yes.""  On labelling the BBC as ""Government-funded media"": ""We're adjusting the label to... publicly funded... If we use the same words that the BBC uses to describes itself, then presumably that would be OK."" In the interview - which was broadcast live via the Twitter Spaces service - Mr Musk was also challenged over misinformation and hate speech on the platform. He claimed that there was less misinformation on Twitter since the takeover, and that his efforts to delete bots - automated accounts - will decrease fake news. But many outside experts disagree. One study - and there are quite a few others along the same lines - found engagement with popular misinformation-spreading accounts spiked after Mr Musk's takeover. He repeatedly questioned whether journalists were fair arbiters of truth and said he had more trust in ""ordinary people"". On the issue of legacy-verified blue ticks on the platform, Mr Musk said they would be removed from accounts by the end of next week. Former Twitter executive Bruce Daisley - who ran the business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa for eight years - said the interview ""gave us some insight into the strange life of this billionaire"". ""He confessed today that the only reason he went through with buying Twitter was because he believed a judge would force him to go through with the transaction. He's never admitted that till now, so it was a very whimsical interview."" Mr Daisley also suggested the interview showed Mr Musk was not always consistent in what he says.

On 22 March more than 1,800 signatories – including Musk, the cognitive scientist Gary Marcus and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak – called for a six-month pause on the development of systems “more powerful” than that of GPT-4. Engineers from Amazon, DeepMind, Google, Meta and Microsoft also lent their support. Developed by OpenAI, a company co-founded by Musk and now backed by Microsoft, GPT-4 has developed the ability to hold human-like conversation, compose songs and summarise lengthy documents. Such AI systems with “human-competitive intelligence” pose profound risks to humanity, the letter claimed. “AI labs and independent experts should use this pause to jointly develop and implement a set of shared safety protocols for advanced AI design and development that are rigorously audited and overseen by independent outside experts,” the letter said. The Future of Life institute, the thinktank that coordinated the effort, cited 12 pieces of research from experts including university academics as well as current and former employees of OpenAI, Google and its subsidiary DeepMind. But four experts cited in the letter have expressed concern that their research was used to make such claims. When initially launched, the letter lacked verification protocols for signing and racked up signatures from people who did not actually sign it, including Xi Jinping and Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, who clarified on Twitter he did not support it. Critics have accused the Future of Life Institute (FLI), which has received funding from the Musk foundation, of prioritising imagined apocalyptic scenarios over more immediate concerns about AI – such as racist or sexist biases being programmed into the machines. Among the research cited was “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots”, a well-known paper co-authored by Margaret Mitchell, who previously oversaw ethical AI research at Google. Mitchell, now chief ethical scientist at AI firm Hugging Face, criticised the letter, telling Reuters it was unclear what counted as “more powerful than GPT4”. “By treating a lot of questionable ideas as a given, the letter asserts a set of priorities and a narrative on AI that benefits the supporters of FLI,” she said. “Ignoring active harms right now is a privilege that some of us don’t have.” Her co-authors Timnit Gebru and Emily M Bender criticised the letter on Twitter, with the latter branding some of its claims as “unhinged”. Shiri Dori-Hacohen, an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut, also took issue with her work being mentioned in the letter. She last year co-authored a research paper arguing the widespread use of AI already posed serious risks. Her research argued the present-day use of AI systems could influence decision-making in relation to climate change, nuclear war, and other existential threats. She told Reuters: “AI does not need to reach human-level intelligence to exacerbate those risks.” “There are non-existential risks that are really, really important, but don’t receive the same kind of Hollywood-level attention.” Asked to comment on the criticism, FLI’s president, Max Tegmark, said both short-term and long-term risks of AI should be taken seriously. “If we cite someone, it just means we claim they’re endorsing that sentence. It doesn’t mean they’re endorsing the letter, or we endorse everything they think,” he told Reuters. Reuters contributed to this report  The original version of this story stated that the Future of Life Institute (FLI) was primarily funded by Elon Musk. It has been updated to reflect that while the group has received funds from Musk, he is not its largest donor."

In an interview with BBC News on Tuesday, the social media giant's owner Elon Musk said he would make the change because ""we're trying to be accurate"". On Sunday, the BBC disputed the original description, saying: ""The BBC is, and always has been, independent. ""We are funded by the British public through the licence fee."" Speaking to BBC North America technology reporter James Clayton in San Francisco, Mr Musk noted: ""I know the BBC for example's not thrilled about being labelled state-affiliated media."" He said: ""If we use the same words that the BBC uses to describe itself, that presumably would be OK… That seems to pass a reasonable test."" He added: ""I actually do have a lot of respect for the BBC."" In response, the BBC said it ""would welcome any such move"". Twitter also used the same ""government funded"" description for US public broadcaster NPR. On Wednesday, the broadcaster said it would no longer post fresh content on the social media platform.  The BBC objected to the original description being used on its main @BBC account. The label links to a page defining government-funded media as outlets where the government ""may have varying degrees of government involvement over editorial content"". The BBC's Royal Charter says it ""must be independent"", particularly over ""editorial and creative decisions, the times and manner in which its output and services are supplied, and in the management of its affairs"". The licence fee raised £3.8bn ($4.7bn) in 2022 for the BBC, accounting for about 71% of the BBC's total income of £5.3bn - with the rest coming from its commercial and other activities like grants, royalties and rental income. The BBC also receives more than £90m per year from the government to support the BBC World Service, which predominantly serves non-UK audiences. Some have raised concerns about government influence over the BBC in recent months, with rows over chairman Richard Sharp's links to former prime minister Boris Johnson, and ex-Downing Street communications director Sir Robbie Gibb's place on the BBC board. Director general Tim Davie has insisted board members ""don't shape the output"", saying: ""They don't make the editorial calls. We do.""

Billionaire Elon Musk has told the BBC that running Twitter has been “quite painful” but that the social media company is now roughly breaking even after he acquired it late last year. (AP Photo/Benjamin Fanjoy, File)       National Public Radio is quitting Twitter after the social media platform owned by Elon Musk stamped NPR’s account with labels the news organization says are intended to undermine its credibility. Twitter labeled NPR’s main account last week as “state-affiliated media, "" a term also used to identify media outlets controlled or heavily influenced by authoritarian governments, such as Russia and China. Twitter later changed the label to “government-funded media,” but to NPR — which relies on the government for a tiny fraction of its funding — it’s still misleading. NPR said in a statement Wednesday that it “will no longer be active on Twitter because the platform is taking actions that undermine our credibility by falsely implying that we are not editorially independent.” “Defund @NPR,” was Musk’s tweeted response. His latest tiff with a news organization reflects a gamble for the social media platform he bought last year.  Twitter, more than any of its rivals, has said its users come to it to keep track of current events. That made it an attractive place for news outlets to share their stories and reinforced Twitter’s moves to combat the spread of misinformation. But Musk has long expressed disdain for professional journalists and said he wants to elevate the views and expertise of the “average citizen.”  
The Public Broadcasting Service said Wednesday it has also stopped tweeting from its main account and that the public TV organization has no plans to resume because “Twitter’s simplistic label leaves the inaccurate impression that PBS is wholly funded by the federal government.” Media analysts say growing friction between Twitter and news organizations since Musk bought the platform is bad for Twitter, and bad for the public. “It’s a shame to have proceeded in a direction where, intentionally or otherwise, Twitter is categorizing Russian propaganda outlets in a similar way to very legitimate news sources that get a very modest amount of funding from the U.S. government,” said Paul Barrett, deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. This is just the latest example of Musk tangling with mainstream news organizations. He abruptly suspended the accounts of individual journalists who wrote about Twitter late last year, claiming some were trying to reveal his location.  Twitter earlier in April removed the verification check mark on the main account of The New York Times, singling out the newspaper and disparaging its reporting after it said it would not pay Twitter for verification of its institutional accounts.  Twitter used to tag journalists and other high-profile accounts with blue check marks to verify their identity and distinguish them from impostors. But Musk has derided the marks as an undeserved status symbol and plans to take them away from anyone not buying a premium subscription. Those cost as little as $8 a month for individuals and a minimum of $1,000 a month for organizations. Barrett said Musk appears to be intent on “insulting and antagonizing individuals and organizations that he considers to be too liberal for his taste.” But by driving away legitimate news outlets, Twitter is only harming itself, he said. “The drift is in an unfortunate direction,” Barrett said. “You want to encourage sources of reliable, well-reported news to be present and prolific on your platform.”  NPR’s main account, which joined Twitter in 2007, had not tweeted since April 4. On Wednesday, it sent a series of tweets listing other places to find its journalism. NPR spokesperson Isabel Lara said its journalists, employees and member stations can decide on their own if they want to keep using the platform. NPR journalists have not been given the “government-funded” label, at least not yet.  NPR does receive U.S. government funding through grants from federal agencies and departments, along with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The company has said it accounts for less than 1% of NPR’s annual operating budget. Much of its funding comes from sponsorships and dues from its member stations around the U.S., which in turn get revenue from a range of funders including public institutions, corporate donors and listeners. Twitter’s new labels have often appeared arbitrarily assigned. For example, Twitter hasn’t added the “government-funded” label for many other public broadcasting organizations, such as those in Canada and Australia. It also has changed some labels without explanation, such as when it removed a “United Arab Emirates state-affiliated media” tag from the profile of Abu Dhabi’s The National newspaper earlier this year. In an interview Tuesday with a BBC technology reporter at Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters, Musk acknowledged that the British organization “is not thrilled” about the label it received and asked the reporter for feedback. “Our goal was simply to be as truthful and accurate as possible,” Musk said. “So I think we’re adjusting the label to be ‘publicly funded,’ which I think is perhaps not too objectionable. We’re trying to be accurate.” The BBC said Wednesday it would welcome being described as publicly funded instead of government-funded. Hours later, BBC got its “publicly funded media” label, but not NPR or PBS. The literary organization PEN America said news organizations are making understandable responses to Twitter’s “unpredictable and capricious” policy decisions but the loss to consumers will be significant. Liz Woolery, PEN America’s digital policy leader, said “Musk’s approach to managing Twitter has come at the expense of information integrity and user trust, and it has only made it harder for users to sift through the maelstrom of online content to find what is credible.” AP Writers David Bauder and Kelvin Chan contributed to this report.

""My expectation for the next flight would be to reach orbit,"" Musk said, speaking during a discussion on Twitter Spaces on Saturday. While SpaceX does secondary rounds about twice a year, to give employees and other company shareholders a chance to sell stock, Musk said the company does ""not anticipate needing to raise funding"" to further bolster the Starship program and its other ventures. ""To my knowledge, we do not need to raise incremental funding for SpaceX,"" Musk said. As for the dramatic first fully stacked Starship rocket launch on April 20,"" the SpaceX CEO said, ""The outcome was roughly in what I expected, and maybe slightly exceeding my expectations."" Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter. SpaceX has multiple further prototypes in various stages of assembly and aims to launch the next attempt at reaching space with the towering rocket within a few months. ""The goal of these missions is just information. Like, we don't have any payload or anything — it's just to learn as much as possible,"" Musk said. He put the probability of reaching orbit with a Starship flight this year at ""probably"" 80%, but espoused that he thinks there is a ""100% chance of reaching orbit within 12 months."" The Starship flight got off the launchpad and achieved several milestones, but Musk gave more details on a variety of the problems the rocket suffered. The rocket took off with only 30 of the 33 Raptor engines ignited at the base of the Super Heavy booster. Musk said SpaceX ""chose not to start"" three engines, as they were not ""healthy enough to bring them to full thrust. Starship slid laterally off the launchpad as it climbed into the sky, which Musk said was ""because of the engine failures."" About 27 seconds into the flight, SpaceX ""lost communications"" with another engine — an incident that happened ""with some kind of energetic event"" that removed the heat shield around several other engines. ""Things really hit the fan"" around 85 seconds into the launch, when SpaceX lost ""thrust vector control"" — or the ability to steer the rocket. Additionally, Musk reported that it took about 40 seconds for the rocket's AFTS (Autonomous Flight Termination System, which destroys the vehicle in the event it flies off course) to kick in, which SpaceX will need to correct before the next launch attempt. The strongest part of the rocket's performance was how well it held together, including passing through a launch milestone called ""Max Q,"" or the moment when atmospheric pressure is strongest on the rocket. ""The vehicle's structural margins appear to be better than we expected, as we can tell from the vehicle actually doing somersaults towards the end and still staying intact,"" Musk said. Looking forward, Musk said SpaceX has ""made so many improvements"" to future prototypes. The company needs to ensure ""that we don't lose thrust vector control"" with the next launch. Back on the ground, Musk said the booster created a ""rock tornado"" underneath the rocket as it was lifting off. While SpaceX has not seen ""evidence that the rock tornado actually damaged engines or heat shields in a material way,"" Musk noted that the company ""certainly didn't expect"" to destroy the launch pad's concrete and create a crater in its wake. ""One of the more plausible explanations is that ... we may have compressed the sand underneath the concrete to such a degree that the concrete effectively bent and then cracked,"" Musk said. A priority for the next flight will be starting the 33 Raptor engines ""faster and get off the pad faster,"" Musk said. It took about five seconds for SpaceX to start the engines and launch the rocket, which Musk noted ""is a really long time to be blasting the pad."" The company aims to cut that time in half for the next attempt. Photos of the aftermath have shown the violent result of the Super Heavy booster's engines. A report from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said the launch flung concrete and metal ""thousands of feet away"" and created a cloud of dust and pulverized concrete that fell as far as 6.5 miles from the launch site. On Saturday, Musk said ""the pad damage is actually quite small"" and should ""be repaired quickly."" He estimated the needed repairs mean SpaceX will be ""probably ready to launch in six to eight weeks."" SpaceX will replace some of the propellant tanks near the launchpad. The 500-foot tall tower ""is in good shape,"" with ""no meaningful damage"" even though it was struck by ""some pretty big chunks of concrete."" Musk believes the biggest hurdle to flying again ""is probably requalification"" of the AFTS that destroyed the rocket, since ""it took way too long"" to detonate. SpaceX is moving forward with a plan to put steel plates, which will be cooled by a water system, underneath the launch tower for the next Starship rocket. Environmental activists and researchers have raised alarms about the cloud of pulverized concrete and dust that the launch created. Musk argued that the debris was ""not toxic at all,"" but said that ""we don't want to do that again."" ""To the best of our knowledge there has not been any meaningful damage to the environment that we're aware of,"" Musk said. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Elon Musk's Free-Speech Charade Is Over. Now that the mogul has swung Twitter to the right, conservatives no longer believe that social-media ...","Now that the mogul has swung Twitter to the right, conservatives no longer believe that social-media policies violate the First Amendment. When the right-wing billionaire Elon Musk wanted a journalist to spread the word about supposed left-wing censorship under Twitter’s previous ownership, he went to Matt Taibbi. But last week, Twitter began to throttle traffic to the newsletter platform Substack, where Taibbi does most of his writing, and apparently began hiding Taibbi’s tweets in Twitter's search results. Musk’s chosen conduit for exposing what he described as past Twitter’s censorship was now being censored by Musk’s Twitter. Although Musk has insisted the temporary throttling of Substack was a mistake, Taibbi claimed that it was in response to a “dispute” over the company’s new Twitter-like service. Blocking access to a competitor may seem, well, at odds with the “free-speech absolutism” that Musk has proclaimed and that admirers like Taibbi have praised. As the reporter Mike Masnick writes, the above behavior clearly falls into what Musk fans described as censorship under Twitter’s previous ownership. But it’s consistent with what more perceptive observers noted about Musk as he was considering buying the network: The mogul’s treatment of union organizers and whistleblowers suggested that “free-speech absolutism” was mostly code for a high tolerance for bigotry toward particular groups, a smoke screen that obscured an obvious hostility toward any speech that threatened his ability to make money. Read: Elon Musk is spiraling Not since Donald Trump has liberal judgment about the focus of a right-wing cult of personality been so swiftly vindicated. During his tenure at Twitter, Musk has suspended reporters and left-wing accounts that drew his ire, retaliated against media organizations perceived as liberal, ordered engineers to boost his tweets after he was humiliated when a tweet from President Joe Biden about the Super Bowl did better than his own, secretly promoted a list of accounts of his choice, and turned the company’s verification process into a subscription service that promises increased visibility to Musk sycophants and users desperate enough to pay for engagement. At the request of the right-wing government in India, the social network has blocked particular tweets and accounts belonging to that government’s critics, a more straightforward example of traditional state censorship. But despite all of that, he has yet to face state legislation alleging that what he does with the website he owns is unconstitutional. That’s notable because, until Musk bought Twitter late last year, conservatives were arguing that the company’s moderation decisions violated the First Amendment, even though Twitter is a private company and not part of the government. Now that Musk is using his editorial discretion as owner of the company to promote people and ideas he supports—primarily right-wing influencers—and diminish the reach of those he does not, the constitutional emergency has subsided. At least until his allies and defenders on Substack found themselves unable to promote their work on Twitter, free speech had been restored, because “free speech” here simply means that right-wing ideas and arguments are favored. This outcome—that Twitter under Musk would favor right-wing content—was predictable, and I’m saying that because I wrote last April that that’s what would happen. The episode reveals something important about the way that many conservative jurists and legal scholars now approach the principle of free speech. Florida and Texas passed laws prohibiting social-media companies from moderating user-generated content, in retaliation for what they characterized as liberal “censorship.” A federal judge appointed by Trump, Andrew Oldham, then upheld the Texas law with a ruling that scoffed at the idea that “editorial discretion” constituted a “freestanding category of First-Amendment-protected expression” and insisted that the platforms’ moderation decisions did not qualify for that protection. Whether “editorial discretion” is a “freestanding” category of protected speech is irrelevant; engaging in protected speech is impossible absent the freedom to decide what to say, or for that matter what ideas are worthy of publication. Conservatives agree, as long as those platforms are conservative; right-wing platforms such as Parler and Truth Social have strict moderation policies that conservatives are not challenging as unconstitutional. Like the newfound opposition to vaccine mandates, this blinkered view of free speech was met by conservative judges eager to validate right-wing cultural shifts, no matter how bizarre or contradictory, through their strained method of constitutional interpretation. The ghosts of the Framers may be summoned through the necromancy of undead constitutionalism, through which the authors of our founding document can be confirmed to have had the same concerns and priorities as extremely online conservatives. Now that Musk is utilizing his editorial discretion to move the social network in a right-wing direction, however, no one is insisting that his exercise of editorial discretion violates the Constitution—not even his liberal critics. Adam Serwer: Why conservatives invented a ‘right to post’ Conservatives built an entire body of jurisprudence around the First Amendment’s protection of corporate speech when large corporations were reliably funding Republican causes and campaigns—the late Justice Antonin Scalia declared in the Citizens United decision that “to exclude or impede corporate speech is to muzzle the principal agents of the modern free economy.” But once some corporate actors decided it was in their financial interests to make decisions that the GOP disliked, conservative lawyers then turned around and argued that speech was no longer protected if it was used for purposes they opposed. If your freedom of speech is only protected when it aligns with the ruling party, then you do not have a right to freedom of speech. Faced with right-wing outrage over the moderation decisions of social-media platforms, conservative judges turned the First Amendment upside down by upholding—or signaling their sympathy with—state laws designed to punish social-media platforms for being insufficiently conservative. They invented a “conservative right to post” in which the First Amendment restricted private platforms the way it does the government, but only if those platforms were perceived as liberal. Perhaps nowhere is this inversion of the First Amendment more clear than on the issue of abortion rights; the same lawmakers insisting that the content-moderation policies of private firms violate the First Amendment are feverishly attempting to criminalize online speech related to abortion. The platforms targeted by anti-moderation laws were never liberal; they imposed moderation policies because it is difficult to maintain advertising revenue when your platform is overrun by teenage Nazis with anime avatars and aspiring far-right intellectuals desperate to impress them. Musk’s changes were far more ideologically driven and have reportedly, by his own evaluation, halved the value of his company. Conservatives rapidly reversed their stance on corporate free-speech rights when they were angry at Twitter for being too left-wing, then changed their mind again once Musk bought Twitter and began amplifying right-wing voices at the expense of others. Musk owns the platform, and he can use it to magnify or ignore whatever ideas and sources he chooses. But it’s not a right that most of these conservative, self-styled defenders of free speech think you should have. For them, free speech is when they can say what they want, and when you can say what they want."

Elon Musk has created a new company dedicated to artificial intelligence called X.AI, The Wall Street Journal reports.","By  Jay Peters and  Emma Roth Elon Musk has created a new company dedicated to artificial intelligence — and it’s called X.AI, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The company, which a Nevada filing indicates was incorporated last month, currently has Musk as its director and Jared Birchall, the director of Musk’s family office, listed as its secretary. The filing, which The Verge has also obtained, indicates that Musk incorporated the business on March 9th, 2023. Rumors about Musk starting up an AI company have been floating around for days, with a report from Business Insider revealing that Musk had purchased thousands of graphic processing units (GPUs) to power an upcoming generative AI product. The Financial Times similarly reported that Musk planned to create an AI firm to compete with the Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Musk even reportedly sought funding from SpaceX and Tesla investors to get the company started. During an interview on Twitter Spaces, when Musk was asked about all the GPUs he purchased, the billionaire made no mention of his plans to build an AI company, stating “it seems like everyone and their dog is buying GPUs at this point.” The purported X.AI name matches the branding of the X Corp. name he has since assigned to Twitter, along with the “X” label he’s applied to his vision of an “everything app.” Musk has been openly opposed to OpenAI, the AI organization that he co-founded in 2015 but walked away from in 2018, and recently signed a letter calling for a pause on “giant AI experiments.” In recent months, OpenAI has become a hugely recognizable name on the backs of technology like ChatGPT and GPT-4 and is partially responsible for kicking off Microsoft and Google’s current push to integrate AI tools more deeply into many of its products.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

					In-depth reporting, data and actionable intelligence for policy professionals – all in one place.				        
Brussels is looking to negotiate a ‘security agreement’ with US to keep its space program running. The European Commission wants to cut deals with private American space companies like Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch cutting-edge European navigation satellites due to continued delays to Europe's next generation Ariane rocket system. In a draft request to EU countries seen by POLITICO, the Commission is planning to ask for a green light to negotiate ""an ad-hoc security agreement"" with the U.S. for its rocket companies to ""exceptionally launch Galileo satellites.” The Commission reckons only SpaceX's Falcon 9 heavy launcher and United Launch Alliance's Vulcan system are up to the job of sending the EU's new geo-navigation Galileo satellites — which weigh around 700 kilograms each — into orbit. Seeking U.S. help to keep its flagship space program running puts a dent in the EU’s idea of strategic autonomy. Galileo is a point of pride for the EU, as it seeks to become less dependent on other regions for critical infrastructure, services and technology — a quest strongly backed by Paris. The EU is having to seek assistance to launch new versions of its navigation satellites because the Ariane 5 rocket, developed by France-based ArianeGroup and launched from France's South American spaceport in French Guiana, is to be retired in the next months. The deployment of its replacement, Ariane 6, has been delayed; the new system is currently expected to carry out a maiden launch at the end of this year, with full commercial deployment starting next year.  The alternative to the Ariane series would have been launching Galileo satellites with Russian-built Soyuz rockets, a version of which are also used at the French Guiana site. However, since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, two Galileo launches using Soyuz rockets have been cancelled, prompting the search for alternatives. Galileo satellites beam highly accurate navigation and precise time data back to earth — and also provide a top secret encrypted service for use by government agencies. That means launches typically can only be carried out from EU territory under tight security rules. ""In view of the security sensitive information … included in Galileo satellites, an ad-hoc legally binding security agreement with [the] U.S. is necessary, in order to protect the integrity of the satellites and the Galileo constellation,"" said part of a draft proposal from the Commission seen by POLITICO. It will be up to EU countries to approve negotiations for an agreement, which would come under the umbrella of standing deals on the exchange of classified information, the proposal states. Capacity to launch satellites and humans into space independently of other powers has been a key part of French efforts to develop the concept of strategic autonomy for Europe. But the need to contract out launches of critical space infrastructure to private companies operating in the U.S. undermines the argument that Europe is able to manage its own alternative to the U.S. GPS, Russia's Glonass and China's BeiDou constellations. ""Analyses are ... ongoing to ascertain whether or not launching with an alternative launch service provider would be feasible,"" said Commission spokesperson Sonya Gospodinova, adding that no decision has yet been taken. Assessments are being made on technical compatibility, launch site security and cost, she said. While SpaceX's Falcon rocket is already operational, ULA only plans its first Vulcan mission in May. The Paris-based European Space Agency, which isn't an EU institution but helps manage Galileo and runs the French Guiana spaceport, had already been looking at alternative launch options for satellites.

https://restofworld.org/2023/elon-musk-twitter-government-orders/,Twitter is complying with more government demands under Elon Musk,20230401,"Apr 27, 2023 ... The orders vary widely in scope and subject, but all involve a government asking Twitter to either remove content or reveal information about a ...","It’s been exactly six months since Elon Musk took over Twitter, promising a new era of free speech and independence from political bias. But Twitter’s self-reported data shows that, under Musk, the company has complied with hundreds more government orders for censorship or surveillance — especially in countries such as Turkey and India. The data, drawn from Twitter’s reports to the Lumen database, shows that between October 27, 2022 and April 26, 2023, Twitter received a total of 971 requests from governments and courts. These requests included orders to remove controversial posts, as well as demands that Twitter produce private data to identify anonymous accounts. Twitter reported that it fully complied in 808 of those requests, and partially complied in 154 other cases. (For nine requests, it did not report any specific response.) Most alarmingly, Twitter's self-reports do not show a single request in which the company refused to comply, as it had done several times before the Musk takeover. Twitter rejected three such requests in the six months before Musk's takeover, and five in the six months prior to that. More broadly, the figures show a steep increase in the portion of requests that Twitter complies with in full. In the year before Musk's acquisition, the figure had hovered around 50%, in line with the compliance rate reported in the company's final transparency report. After Musk's takeover, the number jumps to 83% (808 requests out of a total of 971). The full dataset used in this reporting is available here. The orders vary widely in scope and subject, but all involve a government asking Twitter to either remove content or reveal information about a user. In one case from January, India’s information ministry ordered Twitter to take down all posts sharing footage from a BBC documentary on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Dozens of posts were removed, including one from a local member of parliament. The figures are drawn from the Lumen database, a public clearinghouse for takedown requests and other government orders received by online speech platforms. Maintained by Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, Lumen has collected government requests to online platforms for more than 20 years, with participation from Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, and Reddit, among other platforms. Twitter hasn’t published a transparency report since Musk took ownership, but the company has continued to make automated submissions to Lumen as part of its system for processing government requests. Lumen also collects data on content removed for defamation or intellectual property disputes, but for the purposes of this analysis, Rest of World focused solely on court orders and direct requests from government agencies. Lumen's data consists entirely of self-reporting by platforms, and there's no legal requirement that the reports be complete. Nonetheless, the data is considered to be canonical within the industry, and outside surveys have largely confirmed its accuracy. ""Historically, it seems Twitter has sent a copy of everything they've received to us,"" Adam Holland, who manages the project for the Berkman Klein Center, told Rest of World. ""My understanding is that they have a small team of people that work on this and it’s a largely automatic process."" The biggest irregularity came earlier this month when Twitter's self-reports abruptly stopped. After averaging over a 100 copyright claims a day, the flow of new reports halted on April 15, and Twitter has not made a submission to the database in 12 days. Holland is still determining the cause of the halt and is unsure whether it's the result of a technical issue or a deliberate choice by Twitter. ""I would be saddened if it turned out they decided to stop sharing,"" he said, ""because a lot of really good research is being done."" To put the data in context, Rest of World compared Lumen reports from Twitter’s Musk era (October 2022 to April 2023) against the previous two six-month spans. The results show government requests to Twitter more than doubling, from 348 to 971, when we compare Musk’s first six months to the same period a year earlier. There’s no similar increase in the number of resisted requests over that same period. The rise in overall requests may have been driven by forces outside Twitter’s control. The bulk of the recent requests come from countries that have recently passed restrictive speech laws — most notably, India, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. Germany, which generated 255 requests, recently increased enforcement after revisions to a 2017 law prohibiting hate speech and extremism. Under previous ownership, Twitter actively resisted requests from many of these same regimes. For two weeks in 2014, the platform was banned from Turkey, in part due to its refusal to globally block a post accusing a former government official of corruption. (The executive who led that charge was Vijaya Gadde, one of the first executives fired after Musk took over.) In July 2022, the company sued the Indian government over an order to restrict the visibility of specific tweets. After Musk’s takeover, however, Twitter complied with more than 100 block orders from the country, including those against journalists, foreign politicians, and the poet Rupi Kaur. Twitter replied to Rest of World’s email with an automated emoji response; the company offered no further comment. As part of the drastic reduction in Twitter’s employee count, Musk has decimated many of the departments that process government requests, which may have reduced the company’s ability to resist such orders. At the same time, Musk has made clear in interviews that his vision of free speech does not extend to legal requests. “We can’t go beyond the laws of a country,” he said in a recent interview with the BBC. “If we have a choice of either our people go to prison or we comply with the laws, we’ll comply with the laws.”"

There was an air of excitement on campus as students, faculty, and other members of Stetson Law and the legal community gathered to discuss the timely topic of the 2023 Stetson Law Review Symposium: Elon Musk and the Law.
Throughout the day, esteemed legal scholars examined legal aspects of the famous and controversial billionaire’s many endeavors, from Space-X to Twitter. Speakers included experts from across the U.S. such as The University of Tennessee Rick Rose distinguished Professor Joan Heminway, Stetson Law Bruce R. Jacob Visiting Assistant Professor of Law Tomer Stein, and Florida Supreme Court Justice John Couriel, who gave the event’s thought-provoking keynote address.
One topic, countless perspectives
The symposium covered a range of topics and issues, all exploring an aspect of the eccentric entrepreneur’s multitude of business endeavors through a legal lens.
In the first discussion, for example, Duncan School of Law Vice President and Associate Dean Matt Lyon and Southern University Associate Professor of Law Kenya Smith talked about accountability, from the role of directors and regulators to First Amendment questions surrounding Musk’s purchase of Twitter. It was titled “The Untouchable Elon Musk.” University of Tennessee Rick Rose Distinguished Professor of Law Joan MacLeod Heminway 
Other sessions covered issues like securities disclosure challenges, professional responsibility concerns, and corporate law and governance concerns related to the acquisition of Twitter, Inc.
Breakfast and networking sessions gave attendees the opportunity to connect with colleagues and reflect on the day’s discussions.
A Florida Supreme Court Justice speaks
During an engaging keynote address, Florida Supreme Court Justice John D. Couriel took a broader perspective. Using hypothetical legal challenges a Musk-like figure may face when making business decisions like building a new manufacturing facility, Couriel said there’s an untapped resource that can help lawyers win cases on behalf of such clients: a state’s constitution. Florida Supreme Court Justice John Couriel speaks during the 2023 Stetson Law Review Symposium.
“The lawyer who gets hired is the lawyer who comes up with the solution to the problem that the client hasn’t heard before,” Couriel said. “State constitutional law frequently supplies answers to your problems and lines of attack that the client has never heard. And for that reason alone, to the practitioners in the room, I say, pick up the sword. Develop these areas of the law. To the academics in the room, I say, write those things. Explore them. Because I think they speak to some of the most important challenges of our time.”
A collaborative effort, led by students
The day was a seamlessly run, thought-provoking affair thanks to the students on the Stetson Law Review staff who led it.
Though she worked tirelessly to organize and run the event, Stetson Law Review Editor-in-Chief Kathryn Alkire said she was grateful to everyone who had a hand in the event’s success.

Kline School of Law Assistant Professor Nicole Iannarone, and Stetson University Bruce R. Jacob Visiting Assistant Professor of Law Tomer Stein. 
“The event was an enormous success thanks to the fabulous group of speakers, professors, faculty, staff, and students who joined forces and worked hard to create such an engaging program,” Alkire said. “It truly was a team collaboration.” She added that she and her fellow Stetson Law Review staff members are especially thankful for University of Tennessee College of Law Professor Joan Heminway, who curated the group of speakers and constructed the symposium topic, and Justice Couriel for graciously sharing his insights.
Support from the Stetson Law community
Alkire also expressed gratitude for Professor Stein, who, in addition to presenting at the symposium, served as the event’s faculty advisor, as well as the work of the event’s volunteer, student Symposium Planning Committee (Noah Anderson, Caitlin Carey, Cameron Kubly, and Sophia LaFrance) and Marketing Team (Marketing Editor Jacquelyn Christoph and her assistant Sam McDougall).
Support and advising from Stetson Law faculty members as well as staff from multiple departments helped make the symposium the success it was, Alkire added.
“This event’s success is attributable to an entire team of people who surrounded and uplifted Stetson Law Review with their support,” she said. “We are very fortunate to attend a school that so strongly supports its student-run programs.” The panelists who participated will have their forthcoming scholarship on Elon Musk and the Law featured in Stetson Law Review publications throughout the 2023–24 [KLA1] academic year.

It’s been a year since Elon Musk initiated his takeover of Twitter. The six months since he actually took charge can only be characterized as chaotic, and quietly, in early April, Musk merged Twitter with a new shell company called X Corp. In other words, Twitter Inc. no longer exists.  Musk painted a rosy picture in an April 12 interview with the BBC. He said that Twitter is thriving with “record high usage” and that, despite some “compute glitches here and there,” the “site is doing really well,” advertisers who initially fled the platform after his takeover have mostly returned, and the company is on track to make a profit by next quarter. Musk also scoffed at the idea that he had destroyed Twitter, saying that predictions that the platform would “cease to exist” have “turned out to be false.” To some extent, what Musk was saying is true: Twitter did not implode overnight in a catastrophic technical meltdown, as some of the more skeptical critics of Musk’s reign had warned. So Twitter isn’t dead. But it’s getting there. If you’re on Twitter today, you’re likely experiencing an app that is more frequently broken, more random, and more unhinged. The site has seen a sustained uptick in outages and bugs. Many users are complaining about seeing more content in the new For You feed that they don’t want to see. There are active neo-Nazis on the platform. And just this week, NPR and PBS, two major news outlets with over 10 million combined followers, stopped using the platform, saying they had lost faith in Musk’s decision-making after he slapped a “government-funded media” label on the accounts.   Some people on Twitter, especially Musk’s dedicated fan base, are embracing Musk’s shake-up. But there’s no denying that Twitter today is a more unreliable experience than it was before Musk took over. Musk has justified his many controversial moves by saying that he’s doing it in the name of free speech: to remove power from check mark-touting “media elites” and distribute it to everyone else, no matter how abhorrent their views. The problem is, Musk’s plan doesn’t seem to be working as well as he’s saying. Twitter’s web traffic dropped by nearly 8 percent last month compared to the year before, and has been dropping for the past three months year over year, according to new estimates from data intelligence firm Similarweb. This directly contradicts Musk’s claims that usage is up. In terms of Twitter’s main line of income, advertising, outside data also conflicts with Musk’s claims that all is well. Multiple reports over the past few months have shown that top brands are continuing to leave the platform since Musk took over. Vox spoke with over half a dozen current and former Twitter employees, advertising and marketing experts, and users about the current state of the company. Many of those who worked at Twitter said the platform was only alive because of the technical strength and reputation it’s built over the past 17 years. “You can blow both engines on a jet, and the jet is still going to glide,” said one former Twitter employee of seven years, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to fear of professional repercussions. They added, however, that people should worry about Twitter’s recent privacy bugs, including one that affected Twitter Circles, a feature that’s supposed to send certain tweets only to specific users. Instead, these tweets were made public. “If there are ways the product is breaking apart behind the scenes in ways you don’t see,” the former employee said, “then that’s a really, really bad sign.”  Any attempts to write the eulogy for Twitter, though, are still premature. Musk has a way of defying odds. And despite a batch of contenders like Substack and Artifact, there still isn’t a competing platform that’s seeing the kind of hypergrowth it would need to truly overtake Twitter. That’s partly because some of Twitter’s biggest power users, including journalists, just can’t seem to quit the platform, so it’s not clear where the new digital town square will be. Another issue is that, in the era of TikTok, the world seems to have moved on from text-based social media apps.   How exactly Twitter is losing its relevance and maybe dying is complicated. How it has managed to survive Musk’s chaotic reign, however, feels downright mysterious. There are two basic questions you can ask to assess the viability of any for-profit social media platform: Are people using it? And is it making money? On the first question, Musk says that Twitter’s usage is at an all-time high of 8 billion minutes per day. But those assertions aren’t supported by outside estimates, which — although not exact — suggest that Twitter is actually less popular than before Musk took over. Twitter had a 7.7 percent decline in traffic in March compared to the year before, according to Similarweb data, which marks the third month in a row of year-over-year traffic decline. The analytics firm also recorded a 3.3 percent drop in Twitter’s unique web page visitor count year over year in March; on Twitter’s Android app, average daily active users were down 9.8 percent in March year over year.   Those numbers aren’t necessarily devastating — and Twitter was already losing users even before Musk took over — but they’re in stark contrast to the “better than ever” user numbers Musk keeps citing. Part of the disparity between Musk’s numbers and those of third parties could be explained by how they’re being measured. Even if traffic is down, engagement — that is, how much people are interacting with content on Twitter — may be higher. Musk has also said he cares most about “unregretted user minutes.” This novel metric, which Musk may or may not have made up, refers to minutes that people spend on the platform that they think was time well spent.  Of course, since Twitter is no longer a public company, it doesn’t have to share the details of its user numbers on a regular basis. That means only Musk and Twitter have direct access to internal numbers on user engagement and time spent. So outside estimates of these metrics aren’t a perfect reflection of the size and growth of Twitter’s base. Nevertheless, these third-party statistics raise serious doubts about Musk’s claim that Twitter usage is at an all-time high. On the question of whether Twitter is making money, the company has two main forms of income — advertising and subscriber revenue — neither of which seem to be doing great. Over half of Twitter’s top advertisers from before Musk’s acquisition were still no longer advertising with the company as of last month, according to data from intelligence firm SensorTower by Pathmatics. Many of these advertisers are primarily worried about Musk’s volatile online presence. In his recent BBC interview, Musk said that advertisers are “mostly coming back,” without naming which ones.  Later this month, Musk will speak to advertisers at a major marketing conference run by advertising giant MMA, where he’ll also be interviewed by influential NBCUniversal ad exec Linda Yaccarino. This could be a chance for Musk to ease the concerns of the brands that have fled and try to convince them that business is back to normal. Privately, though, advertisers are reportedly worried about Musk’s presence at the conference, and some have raised concerns about his “racist rhetoric,” according to news outlet Semafor.  If Musk isn’t able to woo back advertisers, he’ll need subscribers for Twitter Blue, a recently revamped subscription plan that charges users for blue verification check marks and other perks, like having their tweets featured more prominently.  That’s going to be challenging. The latest metrics show that only 0.2 percent of Twitter users are paying for Twitter Blue. Twitter Blue did have an estimated 116,000 confirmed signups on the web in March, up 138 percent from the month before, according to Similarweb. Still, that’s not nearly enough to make up for the lost money in advertising dollars.  Musk has been working on a plan to push more people to the paid checkmarks, however. On April 20 — or 4/20, a reference to the old weed joke and possibly his favorite number — Musk says Twitter will finally revoke checkmarks from all verified users who don’t currently pay for Twitter Blue. Many notable users and newsrooms, including the New York Times, have said they don’t plan to dish out the fee of $8 a month per employee and $1,000 per month for their organizations’ checkmarks. Convincing Twitter users to pay for something they used to get for free is a tough pitch. “I’m skeptical that Twitter Blue will become an important source of monetization and generally believe that social media platforms can’t rely on subscriptions as their primary revenue mechanic,” Eric Seufert, an industry analyst for Mobile Dev Memo, said in a Twitter DM. But the real sign of Twitter dying may lie beyond the pure metrics. It’s in how much more unpleasant it is for many users to spend time on the platform. There’s another, more subjective way to judge whether a social media app is dying or not: the quality of a user’s experience. This is a harder metric to quantify, and there’s a mix of opinions about these kinds of changes to Twitter. However, there are some clear ways that Twitter as a product has suffered under Musk’s leadership. For example, Twitter used to be a place for people, especially journalists, to gather for major news moments. But this month’s Trump arrest was an underwhelming moment on the platform, garnering far fewer tweets than past Trump moments on Twitter, like when the former president was diagnosed with Covid. That may be because Musk has been making the platform less journalist-friendly. But it might just be that Twitter is harder to use.  There’s been a string of notable outages that make Twitter a less reliable app, technically speaking. While Twitter has always had crashes, they’ve been more frequent lately. In February, Twitter experienced four site outages, according to the New York Times. And even when the site isn’t completely down, there are often major significant feature glitches, like earlier this week when many Twitter users were temporarily unable to reply to tweets on the web. Musk has also made some controversial changes to Twitter’s core design. A big one involved changing the site’s primary feed from a list of only users you follow to a feed that also shows more algorithmically suggested content from users you don’t follow. It’s called the For You feed, similar to TikTok’s homepage. While some people like the change, others find it harder to keep up with the users they actually follow and care about.  “Before, I would get more feeds from people and topics that I tend to visit more often,” Nalan Yurtsever, a resident pathologist at Northwell Health who mainly uses Twitter to keep up with academics in her field, said in a DM. “I feel like it has gotten worse. I spend less time on it now because it is less relevant.” Other users complain that it’s harder to separate fact from fiction because, thanks to the changes to Twitter Blue, anyone can now buy verification and a blue check mark. Another major concern about users’ day-to-day experience is hate speech.  In November, Musk started granting “general amnesty” to thousands of accounts that were previously banned for hate speech, violence, or misinformation. Unsurprisingly, several outside reports show that hate speech has been on the rise. Slurs against Black Americans increased from an average of 1,282 times to 3,876 times a day since Musk took over, according to a report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate published in December. And antisemitic tweets doubled from June 2022 to February 2023, according to research from the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.   Musk has insisted, including in his recent BBC interview, that those reports are false and that hate speech is declining at Twitter. Nevertheless, Twitter approved and verified a user with the n-word in his username this week. That was after the company allowed several well-known, self-avowed neo-Nazis back on the platform. It’s still hard to say exactly how much this hate speech gets seen. It’s possible that, as Musk has previously claimed the platform would do, Twitter has down-ranked people who produce hate speech so that even if there are more instances of hate speech, those tweets are viewed less often. Overall, there are certainly users who like the changes Musk has made to Twitter’s feed and content moderation policies. Many of them tend to fit into one of a handful of categories: Musk’s dedicated fans, people who were previously suspended from Twitter, and people with interests that align with Musk’s follower base, like crypto and Tesla.  So one could argue that, over time, we won’t see Twitter die completely but rather shrink to fit a user base that’s more niche. Despite all of Twitter’s problems, it’s still kicking — and there are a few major reasons for that. For one, Musk has successfully drawn attention to Twitter by creating drama around his own actions. Each week seems to bring a new publicity stunt, like when Musk changed the logo on Twitter’s app and website to a doge icon or when he altered the sign outside Twitter headquarters to read “Titter.” Musk’s recent spur-of-the-moment interview with the BBC drew in more than 3 million listeners on Twitter Spaces; for comparison, about 2 million people watch Fox News during primetime.  In other words, Musk is a master troll. And while Musk’s antics alienate many users, some conservatives have celebrated his leadership at Twitter, seeing him as someone who liberated the company from what they saw as overly strict content moderation policies. In fact, in the days after Musk’s takeover, conservative accounts saw their follower counts go up. There are also a few signs of hope for Twitter on the advertising front. Despite the broader brand exodus, a handful of major companies, including McDonald’s, Disney, and Apple, continue to spend on the platform.  But by far, the main reason Twitter is still alive is because there is no viable competitor.  The decentralized network Mastodon, for one, has attracted many journalists. But unlike Twitter, it runs on a collection of disparate, interconnected servers, which makes it difficult for the average user to navigate. The popular newsletter platform Substack has recently emerged as another Twitter competitor — Musk also recently banned the company on Twitter — but it’s not clear how much time Substack users will want to spend on a feed when they’re used to reading writers they follow in their inbox. Then there’s Artifact, a startup created by Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom that’s still in its early stages. Even Meta is reportedly working on a text-based social network, though we still don’t have many details about how it would work. “Twitter is unique. News breaks on Twitter. Culture happens on Twitter,” said advertising executive Lou Paskalis, chief strategy officer of Ad Fontes Media, who has tried other alternatives like Post News. Paskalis says he’s still clinging to Twitter despite the recent changes to the platform and Musk’s “carelessness with the things most important to advertisers and beloved by heavy users of the platform.”  If we want to understand the future of Twitter, we can look to what we know about its new parent company: X. The move was unannounced and unexplained, but it’s related to Musk’s long-stated plans of turning Twitter into an “everything” app, similar to WeChat in China, that will be used to do things like make payments, order food, and hail rides. Wharton marketing professor Patti Williams, who studies people’s opinions about companies, thinks the move may have something to do with Musk appealing to his base. Musk has “shaken” Twitter’s reputation, she said, and is disrupting the trust it had with journalists and their audiences. But that’s just one type of audience. For all of the news junkies, culture makers, and politicos he alienates, Musk might be gaining more diehard users, including Tesla enthusiasts, coders, crypto traders, and gamers. In essence, Musk is jeopardizing the strength of Twitter’s brand, but he’s also building a new one in the process. “There’s a lot of value in the Twitter name,” said Williams. “But only if Twitter aspires to what it has been.” So, is Twitter dying? The answer is, the old Twitter is already dead. We’re all living in Musk’s more chaotic, drama-filled, polarizing Twittersphere now.  What’s uncertain is what the new Twitter — or X or whatever Musk calls it — will ultimately look like. And whether it will survive.  Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism? 
      Most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions. But when it comes to what we’re trying to do at Vox, there are a couple reasons that we can't rely only on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on.  
First, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy. We often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead. 
Second, we’re not in the subscriptions business. Vox is here to help everyone understand the complex issues shaping the world — not just the people who can afford to pay for a subscription. We believe that’s an important part of building a more equal society. We can’t do that if we have a paywall.

Here’s why the press falls for his stunts every time. 
Why do reporters and editors continue to treat Elon Musk's every gesture from the grandstand as worthy of coverage? | Matt Rourke/AP Photo 
By Jack Shafer 
04/22/2023 07:00 AM EDT 
Link Copied Jack Shafer is Politico’s senior media writer. Nobody says, “Hey, look at me!” with an authority and confidence to match that of Elon Musk. Not the Kardashians, not Donald Trump, and not even Marjorie Taylor Greene when she sees a camera following her. Like clockwork, Musk feeds a compulsion to work himself in the daily news cycle with a tweet, a threat, a product promise, a media interview or a stunt like smoking dope on Joe Rogan’s show. This week alone, Musk earned headlines for vowing to sue Microsoft, for talking to the BBC about the “painful” part of running Twitter, for promising to compete with ChatGPT by creating his own AI platform, for attaching the “government-funded media” label to NPR, BBC and CBC’s accounts and then dropping it, for claiming Twitter is “roughly breaking even,” for telling Tucker Carlson birth control will lead to the “end of civilization,” for sharing his views on violent crime in San Francisco and for anointing his dog the CEO of Twitter. As Elon Musk media weeks go, it was a light one. But it illustrates his strategy, almost certainly calculated, to hog our newsfeeds by quipping and provoking those around him, by making promises or predictions, and by lofting crude insults or weird theories. In a free country, there’s no law against being a dork or a fantasist of the Musk type, so we can’t ride him too hard for his incitements. And given his status as one of the world’s richest men, he probably deserves at least some of the outsize attention he draws from the press. But factoring all of that in, why do reporters and editors continue to treat his every gesture from the grandstand as worthy of paper and ink, airtime and Internet pixels? Why has the press become such a willing accomplice in his narcissism? A vapor trail of broken Musk promises and failed predictions, all of which became news stories, have been documented by the elonmusk.today website. Musk vowed to build an “everything” Twitter app, but hasn’t. A full-time litigation shop? No sign of it yet. To convert atmospheric CO2 into rocket fuel? A no-show. The list continues: To create a super-fast Starlink service. Produce ventilators. Build a flying car. Distill a Tesla liquor (“Teslaquila”). Start a candy company. Sorry, not yet. When not making news by making promises, Musk enters our news diet by insulting people. He’s knocked a U.S. senator with a vulgar tweet, called a Thai cave rescuer a “pedo guy,” ridiculed Bill Gates’ beer belly and mocked a disabled Twitter employee. When predictions and insults fail to win him publicity, Musk has gained public attention by sharing conspiracy theories, signaling his support of the presidential candidacy of Ye, better known as Kanye West (and then withdrawing it), endorsing hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment and by making a poop emoji the auto-response to questions the press sends to Twitter. This unbroken stream of Musk blarney and BS should be enough to deter the press from automatically reporting the tycoon’s publicity hounding. But as with Donald Trump, the press seems unable to resist splashing coverage on Musk’s unnewsworthy high jinks, even though the stories have now become as common as dog-bites-man. Reporters on the Musk beat have a point when they say you never know which one of Musk’s outrageous stabs at grabbing attention will actually blossom into genuine news. For instance, when he first said he was going to buy Twitter, who among us could look at his track record and think he would actually complete the deal? Few of the acorns Musk tosses out there end up sprouting into a tree, but enough of them do that maybe his every burp does justify coverage.  But that can’t be the main reason the press covers every Muskism that comes over the transom. This column suggested late last year that journalists wean themselves from the Musk habit. But instead of giving the once-over twice to his antics, the press corps has further devoted itself to his promotion. He offers reporters table scraps. They turn it into a banquet. He picks a petty fight. They report it as if it were a global war. He’s got the media machine’s number, and keeps pressing it.  Here’s how it works: Too many editors are eager to assign an easy-to-assemble story from the components of a Musk prediction, threat or stunt. And readers seem to love the copy. It’s Musk-press synergy all the way down. Musk didn’t invent the mock news event, he’s only perfected it. Con men, pranksters and publicity agents have been jamming the press for more than a century with bogus stories like him. In recent decades, hoaxers have persuaded the press to chase the story that Paul McCartney was dead. Another time, a man made worldwide news by claiming to have cured his arthritis by injecting cockroach hormones. Not that long ago, Volkswagen pranked the press with a press release to publicize its electric car by saying it was changing its name to Voltswagen. And in 2009, a Colorado family claimed a helium balloon wafted their son into the heavens.  Some of these pranks can be dismissed as good-natured fun. But most of them stand as critiques of the press, showing how credulous and easily manipulated journalists can be. When Musk engages in his kind of publicity hounding, he consciously exploits the media’s frailty and appetite for copy. His promises, his kayfabe Twitter spats, his controversy-mongering offer the press a preassembled cast of characters, an element of conflict and questions to answer. A grateful press appreciates how the wow factor of a Musk publicity stunt makes the routine coverage of quarterly reports, city council meetings and weather seem mundane. If Musk isn’t on the press corps payroll, he should be. What’s in it for Musk? He has long disdained advertising, believing that the unearned media of a stunt (or the quality of a great product) is advertising enough. According to Ashley Vance’s book, Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, Musk ordered his Tesla staff to produce at least one barnburner of a public relations announcement a week to stimulate interest in the company’s cars. But in a 2021 court appearance, Musk made transparent how he keeps playing the press. “If we are entertaining, then people will write stories about us, and then we don’t have to spend money on advertising that would increase the price of our products,” he said. Naming one of his children X Æ A-12, as he did in 2020, or pushing a Tesla roadster into space or challenging Vladimir Putin to “single combat” or issuing a Ukraine peace plan or selling 20,000 flamethrowers are prime examples of how Musk garners notice for his brands and his products. These advertisements for himself, to pinch a phrase from Norman Mailer, create a buzz about him and his ventures, and project the image of an omnipresent, charismatic guy who makes hot copy. When the press briefly turned against him in 2018 for some of his business miscues, Musk went all meta on reporters by announcing a press-watch site called Pravduh.com. Like so many Musk projects, it arrived stillborn and was soon forgotten, but not before he got a burst of publicity out of it. Which was the point, anyway. Since acquiring Twitter, Musk has made media stunt-work one of his prime occupations — announcing plans, ending them, releasing Twitter files to Matt Taibbi and other journalists, and even tweeting from the toilet. He’ll do anything to keep it and himself in the news, and every day the news media rewards his showboating with an avalanche of running coverage and commentary. But you’ve got to wonder. Is Elon Musk the problem here? Or is it the press, which understands how it’s being manipulated by Musk but just can’t quit him? ****** Every journalist on the Musk beat should read Edward Niedermeyer’s Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motor.

We want to bring this technology from the lab into peoples' homes. We are currently focused on giving people with quadriplegia the ability to control their computers and mobile devices with their thoughts. We keep the people who will use our products in mind, emphasizing safety, accessibility, and reliability during our engineering process. In the future, we hope to restore capabilities such as vision, motor function, and speech, and eventually expand how we experience the world. Our brain-computer interface is fully implantable, cosmetically invisible, and designed to let you control a computer or mobile device anywhere you go. The N1 Implant is hermetically sealed in a biocompatible enclosure that withstands physiological conditions several times harsher than those in the human body. The N1 Implant is powered by a small battery charged wirelessly from the outside via a compact, inductive charger that enables easy use from anywhere. Advanced, custom, low-power chips and electronics process neural signals, transmitting them wirelessly to the Neuralink Application, which decodes the data stream into actions and intents. The N1 Implant records neural activity through 1024 electrodes distributed across 64 threads. These highly-flexible, ultra-thin threads are key to minimize damage during implantation and beyond. The threads of our implant are so fine that they can't be inserted by the human hand. Our surgical robot has been designed to reliably and efficiently insert these threads exactly where they need to be. The base structure and motion stage provide the structural platform for the robot head and the primary 3 axis linear motion used to position the robot head and needle. The robot head contains the optics and sensors of 5 camera systems and the optics for an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system. The needle, which is thinner than a human hair, grasps, inserts, and releases threads. If you're interested in learning whether you may qualify for current and/or future Neuralink clinical trials, consider joining our Patient Registry. Developing brain-computer interfaces is an interdisciplinary challenge. We are looking to hire a wide range of people with diverse engineering, scientific, and operations expertise."

Twitter CEO Elon Musk speaks at the ""Twitter 2.0: From Conversations to Partnerships"" marketing conference in Miami Beach, Fla., in April. Elon Musk has threatened to reassign NPR's Twitter account to ""another company.""  In a series of emails sent to this reporter, Musk said he would transfer the network's main account on Twitter, under the @NPR handle, to another organization or person. The idea shocked even longtime observers of Musk's spur-of-the-moment and erratic leadership style.  Handing over established accounts to third parties poses a serious risk of impersonation and could imperil a company's reputation, said social media experts.  ""If this is a sign of things to come on Twitter, we might soon see even more of a rapid retreat by media organizations and other brands that don't think it's worth the risk,"" said Emily Bell, a professor at Columbia Journalism School who studies social media. ""It's really an extraordinary threat to make.""  Last month, NPR effectively quit Twitter after Musk applied a label to the news organization's account that falsely suggested it was state-controlled. Other public media organizations, including PBS and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., followed suit and stopped tweeting following similar labeling. Musk has since removed the labels, but the outlets originally targeted have not resumed public activity on Twitter.  In an unprompted Tuesday email, Musk wrote: ""So is NPR going to start posting on Twitter again, or should we reassign @NPR to another company?"" Under Twitter's terms of service, an account's inactivity is based on logging in, not tweeting. Those rules state that an account must be logged into at least every 30 days, and that ""prolonged inactivity"" can result in it being permanently removed.  Musk did not answer when asked whether he planned to change the platform's definition of inactivity and he declined to say what prompted his new questions about NPR's lack of participation on Twitter.  ""Our policy is to recycle handles that are definitively dormant,"" Musk wrote in another email. ""Same policy applies to all accounts. No special treatment for NPR."" The threat of retaliation is the latest volley in a months-long conflict between Musk and established media organizations since the billionaire purchased Twitter in October.  Musk has long attacked the media and attempted to undercut the credibility of journalists. The Twitter CEO has suspended reporters who have published or promoted stories critical of him. Musk has stripped away, and at times reissued, ""verified"" blue check marks to news organizations and individual journalists.  By recently making ""verified"" blue checks available for purchase, Musk has created a turbulent social media landscape, blurring the lines for users between what is real and what is fake on one of the most influential social networks.  His remark on Tuesday that he may transfer NPR's primary Twitter account with nearly 9 million followers to another entity is typical of how Musk has run the social media site.  As is often the case with Musk, it is not clear whether he will follow through on the threat. One former Twitter executive was taken aback by the remark, telling NPR that such a threat should be alarming to any business operating on the site, since it indicates that acquiescing to Musk's every whim may be necessary in order to avoid being impersonated. For most of its 17-year history, Twitter has had rules that maintained a certain level of order and offered both individuals and organization some control over their presence on the platform.  NPR CEO John Lansing has previously said he lost faith with ""decision-making at Twitter,"" and that more time is needed in order to determine if Twitter can be trusted again.  A spokeswoman for NPR declined to comment further.  Musk, whose statements to reporters are regularly laced with jokes, insults or attempts at trolling, responded sarcastically when asked who would potentially take over NPR's Twitter account. ""National Pumpkin Radio,"" Musk wrote, adding a fire emoji and a laughing emoji to describe the content of the fictional gourd-themed broadcaster. ""NPR isn't tagged as government-funded anymore, so what's the beef?"" In an email sent at 2:19 a.m. EDT after the story was originally published, Musk wrote a message without any text in the body but with this subject line: ""You suck."" Disclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR Tech Reporter Bobby Allyn and edited by Business Editor Lisa Lambert.

""I think that the whole notion of work from home is a bit like the fake Marie Antoinette quote, 'Let them eat cake,"""" Musk said. ""It's not just a productivity thing,"" Musk said. ""I think it's morally wrong."" Musk referred to tech workers as the ""laptop classes living in la-la-land,"" telling Faber it was hypocritical to work from home while expecting service workers to continue to show up in person. ""People should get off the goddamn moral high horse with the work-from-home bulls***,"" Musk continued. As productivity apparently slackened and investor expectations grew, many executives at companies including Amazon and Salesforce have demanded workers begin to return to offices.

China is one of Tesla's most important markets for sales and production, and Musk over the years has offered a lot of praise for the world's second-largest economy. Musk's visit to China, his first in three years, comes as the country looks to portray a friendly environment for foreign business amid geopolitical tensions with the U.S. and following years of strict Covid controls that have made the operating environment difficult. Here's what Musk did after arriving in Beijing on Tuesday. Musk met with China's foreign minister, Qin Gang, on Tuesday. Qin talked up the potential of the electric vehicle market in China, which he said ""has broad prospects for development,"" according to a statement from the Chinese ministry. Musk praised the Chinese people and China's achievements. Tesla opposes ""decoupling"" and is willing to continue to expand its business in China, the statement said. On Wednesday, Musk met with Jin Zhuanglong, China's minister of industry and information technology. The two sides discussed ""the development of new energy vehicles and intelligent networked vehicles,"" according to a statement from the ministry. On Thursday, Musk met with Chen Jining, the Shanghai party secretary. Tesla's Gigafactory is located in Shanghai, its only production site in China and one of the world's biggest for the electric carmaker. Chen talked about Shanghai as a place for international business, according to an official statement. Musk praised the success of the Shanghai Gigafactory and said he is hoping to continue to increase cooperation with the city in various areas, the statement added. Musk also met with China's vice premier, Ding Xuexiang, one of the country's top officials, Reuters reported, citing a source familiar with the matter. Ding is known as a loyalist to Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Ding is part of the Politburo Standing Committee, a top governing body led by Xi. It is not clear what was discussed, but the meeting highlights Musk's close relationships with top Chinese politicians. Musk also met with Zeng Yuqun, the chairman of CATL, the world's largest electric vehicle battery company and a Tesla supplier, according to local media reports. An image circulating in local media, which could not be immediately verified by CNBC, showed Musk and Zeng walking side by side in a hotel. In March, Bloomberg reported that Tesla was exploring building a battery plant in the U.S. in partnership with CATL. CATL declined to comment, and it was not clear what Musk and Zeng discussed. Musk visited Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory on Thursday, according to a video posted by the company's official account on the Chinese Twitter-like service Weibo. The billionaire gave a speech to the staff and praised them. ""It's been incredibly impressive how you have been able to overcome so many difficulties and so many challenges,"" Musk told staff. ""I tell people throughout the world, the cars we produce here are not just the most efficient production, but also the highest quality."" The Shanghai factory has been key to the electric carmaker's expansion into China. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/ Acquire Licensing Rights NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - Elon Musk is being accused of insider trading in a proposed class action by investors accusing the Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO of manipulating the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, costing them billions of dollars. In a Wednesday night filing in Manhattan federal court, investors said Musk used Twitter posts, paid online influencers, his 2021 appearance on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" and other ""publicity stunts"" to trade profitably at their expense through several Dogecoin wallets that he or Tesla controls. Investors said this included when Musk sold about $124 million of Dogecoin in April after he replaced Twitter's blue bird logo with Dogecoin's Shiba Inu dog logo, leading to a 30% jump in Dogecoin's price. A ""deliberate course of carnival barking, market manipulation and insider trading"" enabled Musk to defraud investors, promote himself and his companies, the filing said. Musk bought Twitter last October. He also runs SpaceX, a rocket and spacecraft manufacturer, as well as Tesla, which makes electric cars. Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk and Tesla, declined to comment on Thursday. The investors' lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Investors have accused Musk, the world's second-richest person according to Forbes magazine, of deliberately driving up Dogecoin's price more than 36,000% over two years and then letting it crash. They included their latest accusations in a proposed third amended complaint, in a lawsuit that began last June. Musk and Tesla had in March sought a dismissal of the second amended complaint, calling it a ""fanciful work of fiction,"" and on May 26 said another amendment was unjustified. In a Wednesday order, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said he would ""likely"" allow the third amended complaint, saying the defendants would not likely be prejudiced. Hellerstein also granted the investors' request to dismiss the nonprofit Dogecoin Foundation as a defendant. Its lawyer Seth Levine called the dismissal ""the appropriate result.""

(Elías Valverde II/The Dallas Morning News via AP, file ) FILE - People hold hands as they pray at a memorial for victims of the Allen Premium Outlets mass shooting, May 9, 2023, in Allen, Texas. Misleading claims about the gunman who killed eight people at a Dallas-area shopping center are swirling on Twitter, thanks in part to the platform’s owner, Elon Musk. Musk has questioned the gunman’s self-professed white supremacist views, and said they could be part of a “psychological operation” to mislead the public. (Elías Valverde II/The Dallas Morning News via AP)     WASHINGTON (AP) — Misleading claims about the neo-Nazi gunman responsible for Saturday’s mass shooting at a Dallas-area shopping center are reverberating across Twitter, in large part because of Twitter owner Elon Musk. Musk has questioned whether the man identified by authorities as the shooter, Mauricio Garcia, really had an account on a Russian social media platform, and Musk suggested that revelations about the shooter’s background could be a “psyop,” or psychological operation, in which the public is misled about the real details of the shooting. Garcia proclaimed his white supremacist views on social media and sported Nazi tattoos. Authorities and independent researchers have confirmed his interest in far-right extremism and white supremacism. When police killed Garcia, he was wearing a patch that read “RWDS,” an acronym that stands for “ Right Wing Death Squad.” “We do know he had neo-Nazi ideation,” Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Hank Sibley said a news conference on Tuesday. “He had patches. He had tattoos.” Musk also cast doubt on a Netherlands-based research group known as Bellingcat that released information about Garcia’s online history when he tweeted that it “specializes in psychological operations.” He offered no evidence to support his claim, but the attack led to a barrage of harassment directed at Bellingcat from Musk’s online fans.  
“This is either the weirdest story ever or a very bad psyop!” Musk wrote in a tweet viewed more than 3 million times. Musk also responded to revelations about the gunman’s ideology, with posts suggesting he didn’t believe them. “Very strange,” Musk wrote in one instance. “This gets weirder by the moment,” in other. Garcia’s online history leaves little doubt that he harbored deeply negative views of Jewish people, people of color and women, according to an analysis of his posts conducted by the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, an Alabama-based nonprofit that tracks extremist groups online. “Going back 10 years, the posts and diary entries show that Garcia held deep-seated white supremacist and neo-Nazi beliefs, as well as misogynistic and incel views, and a proclivity for violence,” the organization concluded in its report. “ Incel ” refers to “involuntarily celibate,” a term used by a largely online movement of men who blame women for their lack of sexual and romantic opportunities. Musk has laid off much of the staff at Twitter dedicated to ferreting out misinformation and toxic content and has since emerged as a source of misinformation himself. A new Twitter feature called “community notes” was created to allow users to add context or fact check claims themselves. But no community notes were attached to Musk’s own Tweets about the gunman as of Wednesday. Twitter did not answer questions seeking comment about Musk’s misleading tweets, and instead responded in its now regular fashion, with an automated email containing only the excrement emoji. Musk wasn’t the only prominent user spreading false claims about the shooter on Twitter.  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., shrugged off Garcia’s self-professed racist views, noting that he was Latino. “Only dumb white people would believe that a Mexican gang member is killing people for white supremacy.”  Greene’s Tweet ignores the fact that white supremacist groups have long tried to recruit Latinos; some such groups have created Spanish-language versions of their websites. And Enrique Tarrio, a Cuban American, is the former leader of the Proud Boys, one of the nation’s most influential far-right groups. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Elon Musk has named a new chief executive of Twitter, just over six months after his ...","Elon Musk has named a new chief executive of Twitter, just over six months after his controversial takeover of the social media company. The billionaire said Linda Yaccarino, the former head of advertising at NBCUniversal, would oversee business operations at the site, which has been struggling to make money. He said she would start in six weeks.  Mr Musk will remain involved as executive chairman and chief technology officer.  ""Looking forward to working with Linda to transform this platform into X, the everything app,"" he wrote on Twitter, confirming the decision a day after he had stoked speculation by writing that he had found a new boss without revealing their identity. Mr Musk - who bought the social media platform last year for $44bn - had been under pressure to find someone else to lead the company and refocus his attention on his other businesses, which include electric carmaker Tesla and rocket firm SpaceX. With fewer than 10% of Fortune 500 tech companies headed by women, Ms Yaccarino will become that rare example of a woman at the top of a major tech firm, after rising steadily through the ranks of some of America's biggest media companies.  This video can not be played New Twitter CEO tells Musk: ‘I’ve met my match’ Ms Yaccarino was raised in an Italian-American family. After graduating from Penn State, she worked at Turner Entertainment for 15 years before joining NBCUniversal, where she oversaw roughly 2,000 people, and was involved with the launch of its streaming service.  Her work has been marked by close collaborations with big brands, finding opportunities for product placement and convincing them to advertise alongside television shows - even ones with a reputation for edgy content, such as Sex and the City when it first launched.  She has also built relationships in new media with the likes of Apple News, Snapchat and YouTube. A 2005 profile in an industry publication portrayed her as a busy, married mother-of-two children, then aged 13 and 9. ""I have absolutely no hobbies,"" she said at the time.  Business Insider's Claire Atkinson has followed Ms Yaccarino's career for two decades and said her background in advertising could help Twitter, which has seen its ad sales drop sharply since Mr Musk's takeover.  ""If Twitter are looking to monetise better than they have been, then that would be the place to start and Linda would be the ideal person to make that happen,"" the chief media correspondent said. ""She's the kind of person that I can imagine Elon Musk needs,"" Ms Atkinson added. ""She won't be rolled over."" Indeed, her negotiating style within the industry earned her the nickname the ""velvet hammer"", according to the Wall Street Journal in 2012.  Ms Yaccarino will face the challenge of running a business that has struggled to be profitable, while facing intense scrutiny over how Twitter handles the spread of misinformation and manages hate speech. When Mr Musk first started discussing his plans for Twitter last year, he said he wanted to reduce the platform's reliance on advertising and make changes to the way it moderated content. He also said he wanted to expand the site's functions to include payments, encrypted messaging and phone calls, turning it into something he called X. But Mr Musk courted controversy when he fired thousands of staff upon his takeover, including people who had been tasked with dealing with abusive posts. He also overhauled the way the service authenticates accounts, charging for blue ticks in a move critics said would facilitate the spread of misinformation. Some of the changes raised concerns among advertisers, worried about risks to their brands, who subsequently halted spending on the site. Mr Musk has acknowledged ""massive"" declines in revenue, though he told the BBC last month that companies were returning.  At an advertising conference last month Ms Yaccarino interviewed Mr Musk and pressed him on what he was doing to reassure firms that their brands would not be exposed to risk.  ""The people in this room are your accelerated path to profitability,"" she said. ""But there's a decent bit of sceptics in the room."" There has also been some instant scepticism at Ms Yaccarino's appointment on social media, where many were looking for clues to her politics, which reportedly lean conservative. Her work for the World Economic Forum, an organisation viewed negatively as ""globalist"" by those on the right, has not been well-received in some quarters along with her role in a coronavirus vaccination campaign featuring Pope Francis.  Others on the left have questioned her political involvement in a White House sports, fitness and nutrition council under former President Donald Trump.   Mr Musk, who has also put women in senior positions at SpaceX and Tesla, is known to be a notoriously unpredictable and demanding boss.  Even the announcement unfolded in an unusual manner, after media reports sparked by Mr Musk's post that identified Ms Yaccarino appeared to catch her bosses at NBCUniversal off guard.  As of mid-Friday in the US, Ms Yaccarino had still not commented publicly on the move. Industry watchers will be curious to see how the relationship develops between the New Yorker and the until now hands-on Mr Musk.  Ms Atkinson said the two Twitter executives would be facing ""difficult conversations"" about how to handle moderation, especially with the 2024 presidential election approaching in the US.  ""How long Linda can last under these tricky management situations is anyone's guess,"" Ms Atkinson said.

Qin Gang said that the Chinese people are advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. Chinese modernization is the modernization of a huge population, common prosperity for all, and harmony between humanity and nature, and will create unprecedented growth potential and market demand, thus providing broad prospects for the development of China's new energy vehicle industry. China will continue to firmly advance high-standard opening up and remain committed to fostering a better market-oriented, law-based and internationalized business environment for Tesla and other enterprises of all countries. China's development is an opportunity for the world. A sound, steady and constructive China-US relationship will benefit both China and the United States and the larger world. Using Tesla's car as an analogy, Qin said that promoting sound China-US relations is like driving a car. Both sides need to hold the steering wheel and move the relations forward in the right direction of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as proposed by President Xi Jinping, “hit the brakes” in time to avoid ""dangerous driving"", and ""step on the gas"" at the right time to advance mutually beneficial cooperation. Elon Musk said that with the hardworking and talented people, China's development makes perfect sense. The interests of the United States and China are interlinked, like conjoined twins inseparable from each other. Tesla is opposed to decoupling and cutting off supply chains, and is ready to continuously expand business in China and share in the China's development opportunities. "

Musk has acknowledged he overpaid for Twitter, which he bought for $44 billion, including $33.5 billion in equity. More recently, he said Twitter is worth less than half what he paid for it. It’s unclear how Fidelity arrived at its new, lower valuation or whether it receives any non-public information from the company. Fidelity first reduced the value of its Twitter stake in November, to 44% of the purchase price. That was followed by further markdowns in December and February. Twitter has struggled financially since Musk took over. After saddling the company with $13 billion of debt, Musk’s erratic decision making and challenges with content moderation led advertising revenue to decline by 50%, Musk said in March. An attempt to recoup that revenue by selling Twitter Blue subscriptions has so far failed to take off. At the end of March, less than 1% of Twitter’s monthly users had signed up. Twitter didn’t specifically respond to a request for comment. Musk’s investment in Twitter is now worth $8.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which uses Fidelity’s valuation to calculate the value of his holding. Musk spent more than $25 billion to acquire an estimated 79% stake in the company last year. The latest markdown erases about $850 million from Musk’s $187 billion fortune, according to the index. Despite Twitter’s issues, Musk’s wealth is up more than $48 billion this year, largely due to a 63% surge in Tesla Inc.’s share price. Contact us at letters@time.com."

In its filing, Virgin Islands officials say they attempted to serve Musk -- one of the richest men in the world -- with a subpoena. The subpoena ...","Musk called Epstein a ""dumb crook"" after he was subpoenaed. Billionaire Elon Musk blasted Jeffrey Epstein, who he referred to as a ""dumb crook,"" after he was subpoenaed as part of a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Virgin Islands against JPMorgan Chase & Co., which officials said ""financially profited"" from deposits made by Epstein. In its filing, Virgin Islands officials say they attempted to serve Musk -- one of the richest men in the world -- with a subpoena. The subpoena appears to seek information about whether Epstein referred or attempted to refer Musk to JPMorgan, according to the Virgin Islands. Epstein, a financier and convicted sex offender, died in 2019. ""This is idiotic on so many levels,"" Musk tweeted Monday night. ""1. That cretin never advised me on anything whatsoever. 2. The notion that I would need or listen to financial advice from a dumb crook is absurd. 3. JPM let Tesla down ten years ago, despite having Tesla's global commercial banking business, which we then withdrew. I have never forgiven them."" Musk was initially subpoenaed on April 28, but he couldn't be reached, according to the filing. The Virgin Islands has asserted the bank should have known about Epstein's human trafficking and that the investigation it conducted into the matter yielded significant information about the bank's dealings with Epstein. ""The Government's investigation has revealed that JPMorgan knowingly, recklessly, and unlawfully provided and pulled the levers through which Epstein's recruiters and victims were paid and was indispensable to the operation and concealment of the Epstein trafficking enterprise,"" the Monday filing said. ""Financial institutions can connect—or choke—human trafficking networks, and enforcement actions filed and injunctive relief obtained by attorneys general are essential to ensure that enterprises like Epstein's cannot flourish in the future."" The Virgin Islands also asserts that ""JPMorgan financially profited from the deposits made by Epstein and Epstein- controlled entities located in the Virgin Islands and from the business opportunities referred to JPMorgan by Epstein and his co-conspirators in exchange for its known facilitation of and implicit participation in Epstein's sex trafficking venture,"" the government added.  Epstein died by suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan in August of 2019, the New York City's medical examiner ruled. JPMorgan has denied any wrongdoing and in March filed a civil complaint against its former executive Jes Staley, alleging he helped hide Epstein's sex abuse so he would continue as a client. Staley, who left the bank in 2013, said in an April court filing that JPMorgan is attempting to used him as a ""public relations shield"" and the bank's claims have no factual basis. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Elon Musk has chosen a new CEO of Twitter and plans to step down from the role within about six weeks, the billionaire entrepreneur said on Thursday. Musk, who runs Tesla and Space X, did not disclose the identity of the incoming chief executive. He said he plans to transition to a role as executive chairman and chief technology officer, in which he'll focus on ""overseeing product."" The announcement comes months after Musk pledged in December to step down as the head of Twitter as soon as he found someone ""foolish enough to take the job."" Musk's tentative resignation late last year followed a Twitter poll posted by Musk in which 57.5% of respondents called on him to stop leading the company. After acquiring Twitter in October, Musk made major changes to the company and its platform. In an effort to significantly slash costs, the company has cut roughly 75% of its 7,500-person workforce, raising concerns about Twitter's capacity to maintain its platform. Twitter suffered a user outage in February that lasted for hours and required an emergency fix, prompting an apology from the company. Musk has also sought to rejuvenate the platform's subscription offering as a means of supplementing its advertising revenue. Under Twitter's new subscription, users gain access to account verification -- the site's signature blue checkmark -- for an $8 monthly fee, which amounts to $96 per year. Previously, Twitter verified celebrities, politicians, journalists and prominent figures on a case-by-case basis in an effort to authenticate their identities and prevent impersonation. Twitter partially reversed the subscription change last month by reverifying some legacy accounts, including accounts affiliated with basketball star Lebron James and author Stephen King. Musk has defended his actions at Twitter as part of an aggressive effort to rescue the company from financial peril, which he described in a Twitter Spaces interview in December as an ""emergency fire drill.""

         Billionaire Elon Musk underlined his views on remote work in no uncertain terms this week, declaring that working from home is ""morally wrong.""  The Tesla founder and Twitter owner, who has claimed to work seven days a week, said in an interview with CNBC's David Faber that employees are more productive in person. But he also expressed disdain for white-collar employees who work from home on class grounds, with most service employees required to do their job on site. ""There are some exceptions, but I kinda think the whole notion of work-from-home is a bit like the fake Marie Antoinette quote, 'Let them eat cake,'"" he said. ""You're going to make people who make your food that gets delivered [that] can't work from home; the people that come fix your house, they cant work from home, but you can?""  ""Does that seem morally right? That's messed up,"" Musk said. Musk also took aim at bosses who work from home while overseeing employees who must show up in person to do their jobs, calling them out of touch and hypocritical for ""asking everyone else to not work from home while they do."" ""It's messed up to assume that, yes, they have to go to work but you don't. It's not just a productivity thing, I think it's morally wrong,"" he told CNBC.  Many large employers in the U.S. and abroad have settled on hybrid work models, recognizing that employees prize flexibility and enjoy the time and cost savings that come from not having to commute to an office. Musk highlighted the distinction between office workers and those whose jobs can only be performed on a factory floor, like auto workers. ""The laptop class is living in la-la land. As I said, look at the cars. Are people working from home here? Of course not,"" Musk said. Not surprisingly, the Tesla, Space X, and until recently Twitter CEO requires that his employees show up for work in person.  Musk said he himself works almost every day, taking just two to three days off per year.  ""I work seven days a week, but I'm not expecting others to do that,"" he said.

Neuralink said it has regulatory approval to conduct a clinical trial of its brain implants in people, a milestone for the company as it ...","Neuralink, Elon Musk’s brain-implant company, said Thursday evening that it has regulatory approval to conduct the first clinical trial of its experimental device in humans. Approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would mark a milestone for the company, which has been developing a device surgically inserted into the brain by a robot and capable of decoding brain activity and linking it to computers. Up until now, the company has conducted research only in animals. “We are excited to share that we have received the FDA’s approval to launch our first-in-human clinical study!” Neuralink announced on Twitter, calling it “an important first step that one day will allow our technology to help many people.” Musk retweeted the post, congratulating his team. Neuralink didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment late Thursday. The FDA doesn’t typically confirm approvals for human clinical trials but offered a statement Friday. “The FDA acknowledges and understands that Neuralink has announced that its investigational device exemption … for its implant/R1 robot was approved by the FDA and that it may now begin conducting human clinical trials for its device,” an agency spokesperson said in a statement Friday. Musk has prematurely touted regulatory approval in the past. In 2017, he wrote on Twitter that his tunneling firm, the Boring Company, had received “verbal govt approval” for an underground Hyperloop from New York to Washington, D.C. Officials at the time offered no direct confirmation of Musk’s claim — and it was clear there were no formal measures to approve such a project. The race against Elon Musk to put chips in people’s brains Founded in 2016, Neuralink is a privately held firm with operations in Fremont, Calif., and a sprawling campus under construction outside of Austin. The company has more than 400 employees and has raised at least $363 million, according to data-provider PitchBook. With Musk’s backing, Neuralink has brought extraordinary resources — and investor attention — to a field known as brain-computer interface, where scientists and engineers are developing electronic implants that would decode brain activity and communicate it to computers. Such technology, which has been in the works for decades, has the potential to restore function to people with paralysis and debilitating conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Already, companies like Blackrock Neurotech and Synchron have implanted devices in people for clinical trials, and at least 42 people globally have had brain-computer implants. Such devices have enabled feats that once belonged to the realm of science fiction: a paralyzed man fist-bumping President Barack Obama with a robotic hand; a patient with ALS typing by thinking about keystrokes; a tetraplegic patient managing to walk with a slow but natural stride. While most companies seeking to commercialize brain implants are focused on those with medical needs, Neuralink has even bigger ambitions: creating a device that not only restores human function but enhances it. “We want to surpass able-bodied human performance with our technology,” Neuralink tweeted in April. Elon Musk says Neuralink is about six months away from human trials The company has designed an electrode-laden computer chip to be sewn into the surface of the brain, and a robotic device to perform the surgery. Neuralink is pursuing a more invasive, high-bandwidth approach than some of its rivals, betting that its configuration will transfer data from brain to computer more rapidly than devices with fewer electrodes or that sit outside the brain’s surface. Musk envisions that the devices could be regularly upgraded. “I’m pretty sure you would not want the iPhone 1 stuck in your head if the iPhone 14 is available,” Musk said at an event in late November, where he predicted Neuralink would begin human trials in six months. Neuralink has highlighted Musk’s penchant for showmanship, implanting a computer chip in a monkey and teaching him to play the computer game Pong with his mind. But the company has also given lengthy, highly technical presentations on its technology, discussing such topics as how it will mitigate the risk of brain tissue scarring and a diminishing electronic signal from the implant. The company has also drawn criticism for its research on animals from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which has called for an investigation into “serious safety concerns” arising from its practices. “Musk needs to drop his obsession with sticking a device in our heads,” Ryan Merkley, director of research advocacy with the Physicians Committee, said in a statement Friday. “If he cared about the health of patients, he would invest in a noninvasive brain-computer interface.” A clinical trial for the device in humans is no guarantee of regulatory or commercial success. Neuralink and others are bound to face intense scrutiny by the FDA that their devices are safe and reliable, in addition to facing ethical and security questions raised by a technology that could confer a cognitive advantage to those with an implant. It is unclear when clinical trials might begin. A patient registry on Neuralink’s website indicates that only patients with certain conditions — including paralysis, blindness, deafness or the inability to speak — are eligible to participate. The brain-computer interface is one of Musk’s most ambitious bets in a business empire that spans electric cars to rockets propelling humans to space and that has grown most recently to encompass generative artificial intelligence and social media. Musk earlier this year incorporated a company, X.AI, that aims to compete with Microsoft and Google after the tech giants launched large language-model chatbots that can answer a vast range of queries. Meanwhile, he has been devoting much of his time in recent months to Twitter, the social media company he bought last year for $44 billion while pledging to restore “free speech.” Musk’s frenetic schedule has him juggling commitments to each of the companies at once. He travels the country by private jet, visiting his Tesla factories and SpaceX launch sites and giving speeches for Twitter and visiting its Bay Area headquarters — sometimes all in the same week. Musk announced earlier this month that he was appointing advertising executive Linda Yaccarino as Twitter’s chief executive, relieving him of some of the responsibility for overseeing the social media platform that has been plunged into chaos since his takeover last year."

Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News    Elon Musk has reclaimed his position as the world’s wealthiest person.
   
      That’s according to a Bloomberg Billionaires tally, which estimated the Tesla
            
                (TSLA) CEO’s net worth is now about $192 billion, compared to LVMH
            
                (LVMHF) CEO Bernard Arnault’s $187 billion.
   
      The two centibillionaires, a term used to refer to people with fortunes of more than $100 billion, have been neck-and-neck for the top spot for months. 
   
      This week, Arnault’s wealth slid after a drop in LVMH’s stock Wednesday, according to Bloomberg calculations.
   
31 billionaires are worth more than the US Treasury has in cash        Arnault surpassed Musk in December, as his wealth climbed due to a boom in luxury goods sales that helped drive up LVMH’s stock price. LVMH, one of the world’s biggest conglomerates, is home to brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Celine.
   
      Musk, meanwhile, has enjoyed a meteoric rise up the world’s rich lists in recent years as his fortunes are directly linked to those of Tesla, the electric automaker. His biggest asset is the company’s stock, of which he owns about 13%, according to Bloomberg.
   
      Outside of Tesla, Musk is also CEO of SpaceX, the space exploration firm, and the owner of social network Twitter
            
                (TWTR).
   
      LVMH’s shares are up 19.7% this year, while Tesla’s have risen 65.6% in the year to date.

							  Edward Luce Simply sign up to the US politics & policy myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox. Future generations might say that the big event of 2023 was when Elon Musk thought of TruthGPT — the “maximum truth-seeking AI” he plans to launch. Musk is many things — brilliant engineer, massive risk-taker, overgrown adolescent. One thing he is not is someone who can be trusted with a technology that could assume God-like influence over our lives. Nor is anyone for that matter. But the point about billionaire libertarians is that they have the money to do whatever they want. There are roughly eight billion reasons why the rest of humanity should find that disquieting. We could start with the most basic: American libertarians should rarely be taken at face value. They generally share two characteristics. The first is that they are rich. It is as rare to find an impoverished libertarian as it is to find a wealthy socialist. The second reason is that their libertarianism rarely stretches beyond their personal freedoms, especially the liberty not to be taxed. Other people’s freedom is their own lookout. Once you accept that Musk’s world view seems to be that he should be allowed to do what he wants, his philosophical confusion ceases to matter. The same applies to many in his cohort, such as Peter Thiel, Ken Griffin and Charles Koch. Watch what they do, not what they say. Many of them subscribe to the outlook on life of Ayn Rand’s epic individualist John Galt, the fictional character in Atlas Shrugged, whose selfishness is presented as heroic. This novel’s message is that extreme selfishness can be extremely moral. Some of Musk’s fellow billionaires support Donald Trump, who is the most un-libertarian figure in US politics. If the former president is re-elected next year, he has promised to pass a federal ban on abortion, deport millions of illegal immigrants and impose a loyalty test on federal employees. He has vowed to be America’s “retribution”. Little of this fits with commonsensical ideas of freedom. Many plausibly argue that Trump’s return would spell the end of US liberal democracy. Not much of this seems to bother the libertarians. Trump, of course, enacted the largest corporate tax cut in US history — a $2tn measure that disproportionately benefited the super-rich. That Musk is this week hosting Ron DeSantis’s presidential launch on Twitter is a nuance. The Florida governor wants to be Trump without the personal drama. Most billionaires, whether on the left or the right, think that they got rich because government stayed out of the way. You hear this account as much from Mark Zuckerberg’s liberal friends as from conservatives. However, this is often convenient amnesia. Musk’s Tesla, for example, received $465mn of taxpayers’ stimulus money in 2009. The research that resulted in Google’s search engine was funded by the National Science Foundation in the 1990s. They seem like small numbers today but they were decisive when these big fish were minnows. Libertarian free speech values are also selective. Among democracies, the US is unique in interpreting any curb on election spending as an attack on free speech. That means people like Musk have infinitely more speech than the average person. There are no limits on what they can contribute to their favourite causes or candidates. Peter Thiel’s $15mn was critical to JD Vance’s success in winning an Ohio Senate seat last year. Both Thiel and Vance are admirers of Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s self-styled illiberal prime minister. Musk has converted Twitter into his idea of a free-speech platform. He alleged Twitter was censored by liberals prior to his $44bn acquisition last year. To be sure, there were instances where flags were put on tweets that went against the rapidly evolving science on Covid, such as mask wearing, for example. Its guidelines were often arbitrary. Now, however, it is turning into a vehicle for Musk’s id. Last week he tweeted that George Soros, the liberal billionaire, was a menace to civilisation: He “hates humanity”, said Musk. Soros demonisation is a sure sign you are falling into dark conspiratorialism. See Orbán, Russian president Vladimir Putin or Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s premier. Musk’s love of free speech vanishes when it comes to China. I challenge readers to find one critical thing Musk has said about the most censored big society on earth. Twitter is blocked in China. But Tesla has a large plant in Shanghai and is planning to open another. “I’ll say what I want to say and if the consequence of that is losing money, then so be it,” said Musk when asked about his comments on Soros. That was badly misleading. Musk can tolerate losses on his Twitter vanity project. But he has bet the farm on Tesla. Criticising China would put Tesla’s business model in jeopardy. Musk, like Thiel, has the right to say what he likes and invest his money where he wants. Nothing in America is seriously threatening that. But this does not give him the right to be taken seriously. The sooner people see Musk’s political motives for what they are, not what he claims them to be, the better for society’s mental health. Even if he were right about government’s failings, Washington needs to put a titanium fence around AI.  edward.luce@ft.com Letters in response to this column: Musk has the right to remain silent too / From Gregory Shenkman, London SW7, UK Why the rich are noisier / From David D Hebb, New York, NY, US UK Edition"

Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. In an interview aired on CNBC, Elon Musk called remote work “morally wrong” and “bullshit,” arguing it was unfair to those workers who can’t work from home.  Musk, who banned remote work at Twitter after acquiring the company, has not been shy about sharing his disdain about work from home policies. But in the interview, Musk was more animated than usual, arguing that remote work was counter-productive.  “I’m a big believer that people need to be more productive when they’re in person,” he told CNBC’s David Faber.  “I’m a big believer that people need to be more productive when they’re in person” Musk imposed a strict return-to-the-office policy for Tesla in June 2022, warning them they would lose their jobs if they refused to do so. Employees would need to spend a minimum of 40 hours at the office a week; anything less would be “phoning it in.” Tesla was more open to remote work before the pandemic, workers told CNBC. But after covid, Musk took a hard line against remote work, as well as other preventative measures like mask-wearing. The company also lacked room and resources to bring many of its employees back to its San Francisco offices.  After acquiring Twitter, Musk set the same strict policy, just as he was laying off over three-fourths of the workforce. During the interview Tuesday, he became extremely animated when CNBC’s David Faber casually referenced the policy.  “Get off the goddamn moral high horse with the work-from-home bullshit,” Musk said, “because they’re asking everyone else to not work from home while they do.” He went on to argue that because people who deliver food and build houses can’t work from home, neither should office workers, calling the decision “messed up” and a “moral issue.” “If you want to work at Tesla, you want to work at SpaceX, you want to work at Twitter — you got to come into the office every day,” he said.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

Neuralink, Elon Musk's brain-implant company, said on Thursday it had received a green light from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ...","The Food and Drug Administration, which had initially rejected the application, finally gave the company the green light Neuralink, Elon Musk’s brain-implant company, said on Thursday it had received a green light from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to kickstart its first in-human clinical study, a critical milestone after earlier struggles to gain approval. Musk has predicted on at least four occasions since 2019 that his medical device company would begin human trials for a brain implant to treat severe conditions such as paralysis and blindness. Yet the company, founded in 2016, only sought FDA approval in early 2022 – and the agency rejected the application, seven current and former employees told Reuters in March. The FDA had pointed out several concerns to Neuralink that needed to be addressed before sanctioning human trials, according to the employees. Major issues involved the lithium battery of the device, the possibility of the implant’s wires migrating within the brain and the challenge of safely extracting the device without damaging brain tissue. Thursday’s FDA approval comes as US lawmakers are urging regulators to investigate whether the makeup of a panel overseeing animal testing at Neuralink contributed to botched and rushed experiments. Neuralink has already been the subject of federal investigations. Last year, the USDA’s inspector general began investigating, at the request of a federal prosecutor, potential violations of the Animal Welfare Act, which governs how researchers treat and conduct tests on certain types of animals. The company has killed about 1,500 animals, including more than 280 sheep, pigs and monkeys, following experiments since 2018, Reuters previously reported. The inquiry has also been looking at the USDA’s oversight of Neuralink. In a tweet on Thursday, Neuralink said it was not yet open for a clinical trial. “This is the result of incredible work by the Neuralink team in close collaboration with the FDA and represents an important first step that will one day allow our technology to help many people,” the company said in a tweet on Thursday. Over the years, Musk has publicly outlined an ambitious plan for Neuralink. He made headlines late last year when he said he was already so confident in the device’s safety that he would be willing to implant them in his own children. Musk envisions both disabled and healthy individuals swiftly getting surgical implants at local centers. These devices aim to cure a range of conditions from obesity, autism, depression and schizophrenia, and to enabling web browsing and telepathy."
https://www.morningstar.com/sustainable-investing/tesla-should-analyze-impact-investors-if-elon-musk-leaves-morningstar-sustainalytics-says,How Would Tesla Investors Be Affected if Elon Musk Leaves ...,20230501,"May 12, 2023 ... Musk's Twitter Adventure Shows Key-Person Risk. The proposal “might have a good chance to pass,” Morningstar strategist Seth Goldstein said in ...","Here’s why Morningstar Sustainalytics supports a key-person risk proxy proposal at Tesla. Tesla’s TSLA board should analyze the impact on investors if CEO Elon Musk or other key officials leave the company, a shareholder is proposing. Morningstar Sustainalytics, in a report, is advising investors to support the proposal at Tesla’s May 16 annual meeting. The shareholder proposal asks the board to prepare and disclose a report on Tesla’s so-called key-person risk. That means the board would identify key persons, like Musk, on whom the company is overly reliant—and whose absence or behavior would affect the firm’s value. In addition, it says the report should have procedures for dealing with key-person risk. They include identifying the key persons, training successors, and mitigating the financial impact of the loss of a key person. The proposal was made by Karen Robertsdottir, a shareholder in Reykjavik, Iceland. Key-person risk isn’t unfamiliar in the corporate sector. Consider Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A and its founder, Warren Buffett, widely considered to be one of the greatest investors of all time. Berkshire investors expect shares to come under pressure if and when Buffett dies or if he becomes mentally incapacitated. Berkshire is a prime example of key-person risk: After all, ratings agencies have downgraded Berkshire in the past precisely because of it. Sometimes, key-person risk arises from CEO misconduct. Consider the case of Carlos Ghosn, the chair of Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi Motors, who was accused of underreporting his compensation. Ghosn is now a fugitive in Lebanon. And the fortunes of companies, like Tesla, can be overly tied to a CEO’s actions. Tesla’s shares fell sharply in April 2022 as news emerged that Musk was interested in buying Twitter. Since then, Musk has become Twitter’s CEO, and reportedly pulled dozens of Tesla engineers to reshape Twitter. News that Musk found a new CEO to replace him at Twitter lifted Tesla shares. Indeed, underperformance often accompanies key-person risk. Shareholder Robertsdottir cited a 2018 Morgan Stanley report that found that in 2017 59 S&P 500 CEOs left their companies. These companies then underperformed the market by 11% in the subsequent 12 months. “In light of widespread concerns that Tesla’s board does not exercise effective oversight of its CEO and, as a consequence, the significant key person risk that Tesla’s shareholders face, we recommend a vote in support of this resolution,” Sustainalytics wrote. In an interview, Jackie Cook, the author of the Sustainalytics report and director of stewardship at Sustainalytics, said the proposal “succinctly summarizes some of the core governance problems at the company.” Tesla opposes the shareholder proposal. It says the board and company management are best equipped to carry out succession planning and handling day-to-day hiring, promotion, and termination decisions. It also says that adopting the proposal would cause competitive harm to Tesla. Nevertheless, in its most recent 10-K report, Tesla identifies key-person risk and says, “In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer.” Separately, a group of Tesla investors are recommending that shareholders vote against a new board nominee, J.B. Straubel, arguing that Straubel is a company insider who wouldn’t increase board independence. Straubel is a Tesla co-founder and former chief technology officer who is CEO of privately held battery company Redwood Materials. In an SEC filing, the group says Tesla’s board already “has strong ties to CEO Elon Musk, with his brother, Kimbal Musk, and Ira Ehrenpreis and James Murdoch, who count themselves as his personal friends, serving as directors.” The group said the board’s current weakness allowed it to rubber-stamp a $56 billion pay package to Musk in 2018, which the Delaware Court of Chancery said should be regarded with “heightened judicial suspicion” owing to the conflict of interest between the approval of the pay package and Musk’s status as a controlling shareholder. The group includes Nordea Asset Management, Pension Danmark, NIA Impact Capital, SOC Investment Group, and others. The proposal “might have a good chance to pass,” Morningstar strategist Seth Goldstein said in an interview. “If Musk stepped down operationally, I think it’s a risk for the stock.” For example, Goldstein relates, when Musk purchased Twitter, Tesla’s stock fell. When Musk made politically charged tweets, Tesla’s stock also fell on worries that his tweets would drive away consumers, the analyst continues. Currently, Goldstein rates Tesla as undervalued. In the past, Tesla has responded to some shareholder proposals. For example, after Calvert Research & Management, a unit of Morgan Stanley, was supported by a majority of shareholders on a proposal asking Tesla to provide more data about its diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, Tesla provided detailed EEO-1 data from its filings with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Even for non-Tesla investors, Tesla’s annual meeting is “the most interesting” of the season, partly because of the key-person risk proposal as well as Tesla’s decision to change the date of its annual meeting by several weeks, making it difficult for shareholders to file other proposals, Cook of Sustainalytics says.

Undoubtedly one of the most enigmatic business figures of our era, Elon Musk’s net worth comes down to his ground-breaking ventures and repeated success in scaling-up innovative businesses. He is the mind behind some of the most revolutionary companies currently operating, including SpaceX, Tesla, SolarCity, and The Boring Company.  According to Forbes, Elon Musk has a net worth of over $187bn, making him one of the richest people on the planet. But his headline-grabbing business practices often see his overall monetary value fluctuate. Nevertheless, he is one of the most prominent billionaires and consistently amongst the wealthiest in the world. So, how did Elon Musk make his money? Be a smarter, better informed investor.

Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail. Born in South Africa in 1971, Musk moved to the US at the age of 17 to attend college, gaining degrees in physics and economics. He soon founded his first company, Zip2 — an online business directory service. This venture quickly made Musk very wealthy and he sold the business to Compaq for around $300m in 1999. This cash was then used to kickstart his next venture, X.com, which later became PayPal (PYPL). In 2002, eBay (EBAY) acquired the online payment firm for $1.5bn, and the same year, Musk founded SpaceX. A year later, he co-founded one of his most well-known companies — electric car manufacturer Tesla (TSLA). It is this business, in particular, that’s behind Musk’s stratospheric rise up the global rich lists, with shares reaching around $400 at their peak in November 2021. Beyond Tesla and SpaceX, Musk has involvement in several other companies, including solar panel installation firm SolarCity and underground transportation firm The Boring Company. Tesla is now a household name down to Musk’s determination for it to be the world’s leading manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs). In part due to innovation, cutting-edge technology, and advanced manufacturing processes, Tesla quickly gained traction within the nascent EV market in the mid-2010s and has since gone on to become a market leader. By positioning the company as a leader in sustainable transportation, Musk has steered Tesla towards success, delivering him huge wealth in the process. He used this wealth to make what many see as his most controversial business decision — the acquisition of Twitter in 2022 for around $44bn. Market reaction to the deal was mixed, but many saw Musk’s move as rash. As such, Tesla's stock market value sank by over $100 billion the day following the deal, causing Musk to lose around $30 billion of his net worth. Elon Musk’s entrepreneurial spirit, ability to innovate, and willingness to take risks have seen him rapidly rise up the ranks of the world’s richest people. So much so, that despite his Twitter woes he is second in Forbes’ index of billionaires, behind only French fashion magnate Bernard Arnault. Arnault and his family have a fortune of $220.7bn, according to Forbes — more than $30bn greater than Musk’s fortune. Musk is wealthier than Jeff Bezos ($137.8bn), Larry Ellison ($129.5bn), and Bill Gates ($114.0bn)  Despite the controversies surrounding Musk's management style, he has remained near the top of global rich lists while maintaining his relevance as a global business disruptor. So while he may not be the world’s richest person today, he is always a contender for the top spot and has earned his place amongst the world’s leading billionaires.

                      Share         If you're reading this while working remotely, Elon Musk is judging you. In a recent interview with CNBC, the tech CEO came down hard on work-from-home culture, saying he thinks it's ""morally wrong."" Musk, who told Tesla workers last year to return to the office or ""depart Tesla,"" has long been vocal about his belief that people are more productive in person. However, on Tuesday, he said it's not only about productivity, it's also a ""moral issue."" ""The people who make your food that gets delivered can't work from home. But you can? Does that seem morally right?"" he said in the interview. ""It's messed up to assume that they have to go to work, but you don't."" Related: Malcolm Gladwell's Fears About Remote Work Are Real. It's Your Brain That's Telling You Lies — Here's Why. Musk, also the CEO of SpaceX, said he believes people should ""put 40 hours in"" and that it doesn't ""necessarily need to be Monday through Friday."" He said he works seven days a week, and that days in a year where he does not put in ""some meaningful amount of work"" only add up to ""about two or three."" Despite Musk's opinion, in a 2022 Cisco survey, 78% of respondents said remote and hybrid work improved their overall well-being. Still, there is an argument for one glaring problem posed by remote work beyond the CEO's argument of productivity and morality: commercial real estate. Across the U.S., nearly 20% of office spaces are vacant, and those numbers almost double in big cities like New York and San Francisco, where less than half of the cities' office spaces are occupied, according to property management company, Kastle Systems. The trouble with vacant buildings isn't just the eeriness they possess or the dust they collect, but the trillions in debt they potentially foreshadow. According to Morgan Stanley, nearly $1.5 trillion in commercial real estate debt will be due by the end of 2025, and a potential surge of loan defaults could be catastrophic for an already fragile banking system plagued by three bank failures in 2023 thus far. Related: Fully Remote Work May Be A Relic of the Past, According to a New Report However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 72.5% of businesses said their workers rarely or never worked from home in 2022, marking a close return to the pre-pandemic number of 76.7%.

    -    May 1, 2023 5:24 pm UTC 
In a wide-ranging talk on Saturday night, SpaceX founder Elon Musk reviewed the debut launch of the Starship rocket on April 20. The bottom line, he said, is that the vehicle's flight slightly exceeded his expectations and that damage to the launch site was not all that extensive. He expects Starship to fly again in as few as two or three months. ""Basically the outcome was roughly sort of what I expected and maybe slightly exceeded my expectations,"" he said. ""And I'm glad to report that the pad damage is actually quite small, and it looks like it can be repaired quite quickly. It was actually just good to get this vehicle off the ground because we've made so many improvements in Booster 9 and beyond."" Musk spoke for about an hour during a Twitter spaces event, responding to questions from several journalists and spaceflight enthusiasts. For those unable to listen, what follows is a summary of what Musk said. When the rocket lifted off, there were three engines whose ignition was terminated because the flight software did not deem them ""healthy enough"" to bring to full thrust. That left 30 of the Super Heavy first stage's 33 engines in good condition, which is the minimum allowable number for liftoff. Musk said he did not believe these three engines were damaged by the gravel and concrete kicked up by the immense thrust created by the rocket as it slowly lifted off from the pad. ""Weirdly, we did not see evidence of the rock tornado actually damaging engines or heat shields in a material way,"" he said. ""It may have been, but we have not yet seen evidence of that."" At 27 seconds into the flight, engine 19 lost communications concurrent with some kind of “energetic event,” Musk said. This also liberated the outer heat shield from four nearby engines. SpaceX engineers are still assessing exactly what this energetic event was. “So something bad happened at T-plus 27 seconds because the engine 19 lost all communications, and some kind of explosion happened to knock out the heat shields of engines 17, 18, 19, and 20,"" Musk said. ""There were visible fires seen from the aft end of the vehicle for the remainder of the flight, but the rocket kept going. At T-plus 62 seconds, we see additional aft heat shield damage near engine 30; however, the engine continues to run. And then T-plus 85 seconds is where things really hit the fan."" At that point, the rocket started to lose its thrust vector control, or the ability to steer itself. This led to the initiation of the flight termination system. Just before a minute and a half into its mission, the rocket's flight termination system was initiated to break up the vehicle before it veered too far off course. Essentially, the ordnance on board the rocket detonates to rupture its fuel tanks, leading to a breakup. However, in this case, there was about a 40-second delay between the initiation of the system and the rocket breaking apart. This time lag posed no safety issues with the rocket safely offshore, but it is an unacceptable lag for a system that is supposed to terminate flight almost immediately. Musk said the problem could be solved with a ""longer detonation cord"" to make sure the propellant tanks are fully unzipped rapidly. However, he acknowledged that working through this issue with the Federal Aviation Administration may take some time. ""The longest lead item is probably requalification of the flight termination system,"" Musk said. ""That's obviously something that we want to make sure of before proceeding with the next flight.""

The Associated Press  May 19, 2023, 1:37 PM SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco officials are investigating Twitter after six former employees allege that owner Elon Musk’s leadership team broke laws by turning the company’s headquarters into a “Twitter Hotel” for workers who were pushed to stay up late to transform the social media platform. The San Francisco Department of Building Inspection said Friday that it has opened a new complaint and will be conducting an investigation into the new allegations. The San Francisco Chronicle earlier reported on the city’s latest investigation into the company that Musk took over late last year.  That’s after the ex-employees, including a former vice president of real estate, alleged in a lawsuit filed in a federal court in Delaware that Twitter didn’t pay them promised severance. Twitter is seeking to have the case dismissed. The ex-workers also allege that Musk’s team ordered numerous changes to the company’s headquarters in a 1930s Art Deco building in downtown San Francisco that violated building codes. Those changes included disabling lights and adding locks that wouldn’t open during an emergency, according to the lawsuit. One of the plaintiffs is Tracy Hawkins, Twitter’s former vice president of real estate and workplace, who was responsible for managing the company’s physical offices and leases. The lawsuit says Hawkins wasn’t initially opposed to Musk’s takeover but “was forced to resign when Elon Musk and his transition team insisted that she violate her professional ethics by causing Twitter to intentionally breach its leases and other contracts.” The lawsuit claims Musk refused to pay rent on the building. This is not the first time San Francisco officials have tussled with Musk, who bought Twitter for $44 billion in October and gutted much of its workforce as he converted a part of the company’s headquarters into bedrooms. Earlier this year, San Francisco building inspectors gave Twitter’s construction contractor two weeks to submit a corrected building use permit if the company wanted to keep using two conference rooms as bedrooms. The city launched an investigation in December after Forbes reported on the beds, prompting Musk to lash out at San Francisco Mayor London Breed, even though there is no evidence she was involved in the inspection.

	Elon Musk's brain-implant company Neuralink on Thursday said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had given the green light to its first-in-human clinical trial, a critical milestone after earlier struggles to gain approval. 
	The FDA nod ""represents an important first step that will one day allow our technology to help many people,"" Neuralink said in a tweet. It did not elaborate on the aims of the study, saying only that it was not recruiting yet and more details would be available soon. 
	Neuralink and the FDA did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
	Musk envisions brain implants could cure a range of conditions including obesity, autism, depression and schizophrenia as well as enabling web browsing and telepathy. He made headlines late last year when he said he was so confident in the devices' safety that he would be willing to implant them in his children. 
	On at least four occasions since 2019, Musk predicted Neuralink would begin human trials. But the company only sought FDA approval in early 2022 and the agency rejected the application, seven current and former employees told Reuters in March. 
	The FDA had pointed out several concerns to Neuralink that needed to be addressed before sanctioning human trials, according to the employees. Major issues involved the lithium battery of the device, the possibility of the implant's wires migrating within the brain, and the challenge of safely extracting the device without damaging brain tissue. 
	Neuralink, founded in 2016, has been the subject of several federal probes. 
	In May, U.S. lawmakers urged regulators to investigate whether the makeup of a panel overseeing animal testing at Neuralink contributed to botched and rushed experiments. 
	The Department of Transportation is separately probing whether Neuralink illegally transported dangerous pathogens on chips removed from monkey brains without proper containment measures. 
	Neuralink is also under investigation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Inspector General for potential animal-welfare violations. This probe has also been looking at the USDA's oversight of Neuralink. 
	Neuralink has not responded to requests for comment on the probes. 
			We are excited to share that we have received the FDA’s approval to launch our first-in-human clinical study! 			This is the result of incredible work by the Neuralink team in close collaboration with the FDA and represents an important first step that will one day allow our…

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/ Acquire Licensing Rights NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - Elon Musk is being accused of insider trading in a proposed class action by investors accusing the Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO of manipulating the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, costing them billions of dollars. In a Wednesday night filing in Manhattan federal court, investors said Musk used Twitter posts, paid online influencers, his 2021 appearance on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" and other ""publicity stunts"" to trade profitably at their expense through several Dogecoin wallets that he or Tesla controls. Investors said this included when Musk sold about $124 million of Dogecoin in April after he replaced Twitter's blue bird logo with Dogecoin's Shiba Inu dog logo, leading to a 30% jump in Dogecoin's price. A ""deliberate course of carnival barking, market manipulation and insider trading"" enabled Musk to defraud investors, promote himself and his companies, the filing said. Musk bought Twitter last October. He also runs SpaceX, a rocket and spacecraft manufacturer, as well as Tesla, which makes electric cars. Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk and Tesla, declined to comment on Thursday. The investors' lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Investors have accused Musk, the world's second-richest person according to Forbes magazine, of deliberately driving up Dogecoin's price more than 36,000% over two years and then letting it crash. They included their latest accusations in a proposed third amended complaint, in a lawsuit that began last June. Musk and Tesla had in March sought a dismissal of the second amended complaint, calling it a ""fanciful work of fiction,"" and on May 26 said another amendment was unjustified. In a Wednesday order, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said he would ""likely"" allow the third amended complaint, saying the defendants would not likely be prejudiced. Hellerstein also granted the investors' request to dismiss the nonprofit Dogecoin Foundation as a defendant. Its lawyer Seth Levine called the dismissal ""the appropriate result."" The case is Johnson et al v. Musk et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-05037.

China is one of Tesla's most important markets for sales and production, and Musk over the years has offered a lot of praise for the world's second-largest economy. Musk's visit to China, his first in three years, comes as the country looks to portray a friendly environment for foreign business amid geopolitical tensions with the U.S. and following years of strict Covid controls that have made the operating environment difficult. Here's what Musk did after arriving in Beijing on Tuesday. Musk met with China's foreign minister, Qin Gang, on Tuesday. Qin talked up the potential of the electric vehicle market in China, which he said ""has broad prospects for development,"" according to a statement from the Chinese ministry. Musk praised the Chinese people and China's achievements. Tesla opposes ""decoupling"" and is willing to continue to expand its business in China, the statement said. On Wednesday, Musk met with Jin Zhuanglong, China's minister of industry and information technology. The two sides discussed ""the development of new energy vehicles and intelligent networked vehicles,"" according to a statement from the ministry. On Thursday, Musk met with Chen Jining, the Shanghai party secretary. Tesla's Gigafactory is located in Shanghai, its only production site in China and one of the world's biggest for the electric carmaker. Chen talked about Shanghai as a place for international business, according to an official statement. Musk praised the success of the Shanghai Gigafactory and said he is hoping to continue to increase cooperation with the city in various areas, the statement added. Musk also met with China's vice premier, Ding Xuexiang, one of the country's top officials, Reuters reported, citing a source familiar with the matter. Ding is known as a loyalist to Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Ding is part of the Politburo Standing Committee, a top governing body led by Xi. It is not clear what was discussed, but the meeting highlights Musk's close relationships with top Chinese politicians. Musk also met with Zeng Yuqun, the chairman of CATL, the world's largest electric vehicle battery company and a Tesla supplier, according to local media reports. An image circulating in local media, which could not be immediately verified by CNBC, showed Musk and Zeng walking side by side in a hotel. In March, Bloomberg reported that Tesla was exploring building a battery plant in the U.S. in partnership with CATL. CATL declined to comment, and it was not clear what Musk and Zeng discussed. Musk visited Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory on Thursday, according to a video posted by the company's official account on the Chinese Twitter-like service Weibo. The billionaire gave a speech to the staff and praised them. ""It's been incredibly impressive how you have been able to overcome so many difficulties and so many challenges,"" Musk told staff. ""I tell people throughout the world, the cars we produce here are not just the most efficient production, but also the highest quality."" The Shanghai factory has been key to the electric carmaker's expansion into China. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg agree to hold cage fight · Two of the world's most high-profile technology billionaires - Elon Musk and Mark ...","Two of the world's most high-profile technology billionaires - Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg - have agreed to fight each other in a cage match. Mr Musk posted a message on his social media platform Twitter that he was ""up for a cage fight"" with Mr Zuckerberg. Mr Zuckerberg, the boss of Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta, then posted a screenshot of Mr Musk's tweet with the caption ""send me location"". ""The story speaks for itself,"" a Meta spokesperson told the BBC. Mr Musk then replied to Mr Zuckerberg's response with: ""Vegas Octagon."" The Octagon is the competition mat and fenced-in area used for Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) bouts. The UFC is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mr Musk, who turns 52 later this month, also tweeted: ""I have this great move that I call 'The Walrus', where I just lie on top of my opponent & do nothing."" He later tweeted short videos of walruses, perhaps suggesting his challenge to Mr Zuckerberg may not entirely be serious. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He also tweeted: ""I almost never work out, except for picking up my kids & throwing them in the air."" Meanwhile, 39-year-old Mr Zuckerberg has already been training in mixed martial arts (MMA) and has recently won jiu-jitsu tournaments. Twitter did not provide a statement when contacted by the BBC for comment. The exchanges have gone viral with social media users debating who would win the bout, while others have posted memes including mocked up posters advertising the fight. For example, business consultant Seyi Taylor tweeted: ""Choose your fighter"" with pictures of the two tech bosses. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Broadcaster and fight sports journalist Nick Peet told the BBC's World at One programme that Dana White, the president of the UFC, would be ""licking his lips at the possibility of putting this fight on"". He said he thought there was a decent chance it could actually go ahead, ""mostly because of Elon Musk and his personality and his eccentric character. His career kind of suggests he's not somebody who willingly steps down."" However, asked who he thought would come out on top, he replied: ""Zuckerberg all day! He's 12 years younger. He is a lot smaller. I think he's 5ft 7, Elon's probably around 6ft. And Elon's probably got a couple of stone in weight on him.  ""But unfortunately Mr Musk has got no training whatsoever. Even though Zuckerberg's only been training Brazilian jiu-jitsu for 18 months, it wouldn't be difficult for him to take his back, wrap his arms around his neck and give him a good old cuddle and choke him out!"" Mr Musk has a history of making statements that are not serious or which fail to happen. For example, he told the BBC in April he had made his dog chief executive of Twitter. In 2017 he tweeted he had ""verbal government approval"" for a so-called hyperloop - a kind of train system - to connect New York City with Washington DC, Philadephia and Baltimore. This has yet to materialise. In 2018 Mr Musk was forced to step down as Tesla chair by regulators after Tweeting that he intended to take the firm private. Mr Musk has also made good on some of his pronouncements, including stepping down as Twitter chief executive this year after Twitter users voted in favour of his resignation in a poll he ran. He had already said he wanted to step back as chief executive in November 2022, however. Earlier this month, Meta showed staff plans for a text-based social network designed to compete with Twitter, sources told the BBC. It could allow users to follow accounts they already follow on Instagram, Meta's image-sharing app. It could potentially allow the company to bring over followers from decentralised platforms such as Mastodon. A Meta spokesperson confirmed to the BBC that the platform was in development. The text-based network - which has a working title of P92 - could turn out to be a greater rival to Elon Musk's Twitter than either BlueSky or Mastodon.

Twitter owner Elon Musk introduced, then quickly amended, new rules to the social media platform on Saturday that set ""temporary limits"" on how many posts can be read per day. Musk initially unveiled Saturday afternoon that verified accounts are limited to reading 6,000 posts per day and unverified accounts are limited to 600 posts per day. New unverified accounts are limited to 300 posts per day, he said. Within two hours of making the announcement, Musk tweeted that rate limits will be ""increasing soon"" to 8,000 for verified, 800 for unverified and 400 for new unverified accounts. Three hours later, he tweeted that the numbers are now up to 10,000, 1,000 and 500, respectively.  The changes were made to ""address extreme levels of data scraping & system manipulation,"" Musk tweeted. Details of the changes came after many Twitter users complained about issues loading tweets Saturday morning -- including receiving error messages saying ""rate limit exceeded."" The hashtag ""TwitterDown"" was trending Saturday as users apparently encountered the new limits. The website downdetector.com showed a spike in users reporting problems accessing Twitter Saturday morning, with thousands of problems reported by the afternoon. Since acquiring Twitter in October for roughly $44 billion, Musk has made major changes to the company and its platform. In an effort to significantly slash costs, the company cut roughly 75% of its 7,500-person workforce, raising concerns about Twitter's capacity to maintain its platform.  In April, the company began phasing out legacy ""blue check marks."" Now, users who pay a monthly subscription fee and meet certain eligibility criteria can get a check mark and be considered verified. Musk announced in May that he was stepping down as CEO, after the billionaire entrepreneur pledged in December to step down as the head of Twitter as soon as he found someone ""foolish enough to take the job."" Musk was replaced by Linda Yaccarino, previously the ad sales chief at NBCUniversal. Musk, who runs Tesla and Space X, said at the time he plans to transition to a role as executive chairman and chief technology officer.

LGBTQ advocates criticized Elon Musk on Thursday after the Twitter owner said he would allow users to freely misgender people on the social ..."," Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time LGBTQ advocates criticized Elon Musk on Thursday after the Twitter owner said he would allow users to freely misgender people on the social media site.  In a tweet on the first day of Pride Month, Musk said he personally uses the pronouns that someone – including a transgender person – prefers because it’s good manners, but that he wouldn’t enforce that policy on Twitter.  Musk made the comment in a reply to a complaint from Jeremy Boreing, the co-CEO of the conservative site The Daily Wire. Boreing, who was seeking to distribute a video opposed to trans rights but said Twitter had canceled a distribution deal, said he considered it a free speech issue to not be able to use pronouns that are different from the ones a trans person uses.  “It is definitely allowed,” Musk told Boreing. “Whether or not you agree with using someone’s preferred pronouns, not doing so is at most rude and certainly breaks no laws.”  Musk said Twitter employees who told Boreing otherwise had made a mistake.  In culture war battles online and off, using pronouns other than what someone prefers is a common way to bully trans people. Twitter banned the practice as part of its rule against degrading behavior or other hateful content until April, when the company’s new management under Musk quietly changed the rule without an official announcement. The rule had been in place since 2018.  Musk’s latest statement drew a rebuke from LGBTQ organizations, which said the new policy opened a door for anti-trans harassment.  “Twitter was once a place where many marginalized people including LGBTQ people found community, and it’s become hostile,” Laurel Powell, a spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, said in a phone interview.  “What we’re seeing isn’t really about censorship or discrimination of ideas. It’s about the kind of company Twitter wants to be and the kind of world they want to shape,” she said.  Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said Musk’s tweet was disappointing.  “This will only increase hate speech that has harmed our community within social media spaces,” he said in a statement.  Heng-Lehtinen said lives may be at risk, citing a 2020 survey from The Trevor Project, an organization focused on suicide prevention. Transgender and nonbinary youth who said that all or most people in their lives respect their pronouns attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected, according to the survey. Musk has a history of staking out anti-trans positions. In tweets, he has mocked trans people and accused trans rights advocates of contradicting themselves. Last month, he participated in a Twitter event to launch the Republican presidential campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has signed several bills restricting LGBTQ rights. A year ago, one of Musk’s children filed a petition to change her name and have her gender officially recognized as female, saying she didn’t want to be related to Musk in any way.  Musk elaborated on his current thinking in his Thursday tweet.  “I should note that I do personally use someone’s preferred pronouns, just as I use someone’s preferred name, simply from the standpoint of good manners,” he said.  “However, for the same reason, I object to rude behavior, ostracism or threats of violence if the wrong pronoun or name is used,” he added.  GLAAD, the LGBTQ media advocacy organization, said the earlier Twitter rule existed to protect people from harassment and to reassure advertisers who don’t wish their ads to be featured adjacent to bullying.  “Elon Musk continues to double down on making his already struggling site less safe for users, and even less appealing for advertisers,” the organization said in a statement.

(AP Photo/Michel Euler, File)     SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Twitter owner Elon Musk has limited the number of tweets that users can view each day — restrictions he described as an attempt to prevent unauthorized scraping of potentially valuable data from the social media platform. The site is now requiring people to log on to view tweets and profiles — a change in its longtime practice to allow everyone to peruse the chatter on what Musk has frequently touted as the world’s digital town square since buying it for $44 billion last year. The restrictions could result in users being locked out of Twitter for the day after scrolling through several hundred tweets. Thousands of users complained Saturday of not being able to access the site. In a Friday tweet, Musk described the new restrictions as a temporary measure that was taken because “we were getting data pillaged so much that it was degrading service for normal users!” Musk has pushed back on what he calls misuse of Twitter data to train popular artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT. They scour reams of information online to generate human-like text, photos, video and other content.  
Musk elaborated on the limits Saturday, saying unverified accounts will temporarily be restricted to reading 600 posts per day, while verified accounts will be able to scroll through up to 6,000.  After facing backlash, he tweeted that the thresholds would be raised to 800 posts for unverified accounts and 8,000 for verified accounts before later settling on 1,000 and 10,000 tweets, respectively. The crackdown began to have ripple effects, causing more than 7,500 people at one point Saturday to report problems using the social media service, based on complaints registered on Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages.  Although that’s a relatively small number of Twitter’s more than 200 million worldwide users, the trouble was widespread enough to cause the #TwitterDown hashtag to trend in some parts of the world. The higher threshold allowed on verified accounts is part of an $8-per-month subscription service that Musk rolled out earlier this year in an effort to boost Twitter revenue. It has fallen sharply since the billionaire Tesla CEO took over the company and laid off roughly three-fourths of the workforce to cut costs and stave off bankruptcy. Advertisers have since curbed their spending on Twitter, partly because of changes that have allowed more sometimes-hateful and prickly content that offends a wider part of the service’s audience.  Musk recently hired longtime NBC Universal executive Linda Yaccarino as Twitter’s CEO to try to win back advertisers. An Associated Press inquiry about Saturday’s access problems triggered a crude automated reply that Twitter sends to most media queries without addressing the question.

Linda Yaccarino, a former NBCUniversal marketing executive, on Monday officially took over the CEO role at Twitter from Elon Musk, ...","Markets   
Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News          Linda Yaccarino, a former NBCUniversal marketing executive, on Monday officially took over the CEO role at Twitter from Elon Musk, weeks after the billionaire announced hiring her for the top spot at the social media company. 
   
      “It happened — first day in the books!,” Yaccarino tweeted late Monday. “Stay tuned…”
   
      A day earlier, Yaccarino had tweeted that Twitter had hired Joe Benarroch, NBCU’s former senior vice president of communications for advertising and partnerships, to join her at the company. Benarroch will work in business operations, according to his LinkedIn profile.  
   
      “Let’s get to work @Twitter! #timetofly” Yaccarino said in the tweet.  
   
The New York Times and The Information first reported that Yaccarino was expected to officially start as Twitter CEO on Monday. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.
   
A new CEO won't fix Twitter's biggest problem         Musk announced in May that Yaccarino, formerly chairman of global advertising and partnerships at NBCU, would be taking over as CEO of Twitter with a focus on business operations, after months of suggesting that he planned to find a new top leader for the struggling platform. 
   
      In December, Musk ran a poll on the platform asking users whether he should step back as Twitter’s CEO, which ended with the majority of users voting in the affirmative. 
   
      Musk is likely betting on Yaccarino’s ad industry chops to restore Twitter’s flagging advertising business. 
   
      On Monday, the New York Times reported that Twitter’s US advertising revenue from the five weeks from April 1 to the first week of May was down 59% year-over-year, citing an internal presentation. (CNN has not viewed the presentation.) 
   
      Just 43% of Twitter’s top 1,000 advertisers as of September, the month before Musk’s takeover, were still advertising on the platform as of April, according to data provided to CNN by market intelligence firm Sensor Tower last month. 
   
      Reversing that decline could prove to be an uphill battle: Twitter’s ad business has declined sharply since Musk’s takeover due to advertiser concerns over hate speech on the platform, mass layoffs at the company and general uncertainty about Twitter’s future direction. 
   
      Yaccarino’s takeover comes just days after the resignation of Twitter’s head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin, who confirmed her exit in a tweet Friday. 
   
      Yaccarino may also struggle to rein in Musk, whose tweets and policy decisions often generate controversy.  
   
      Musk last month told CNBC he “didn’t care” if his controversial tweets drew the ire of Twitter advertisers or Tesla shareholders. “I’ll say what I want to say, and if the consequence of that is losing money, so be it,” he said.  
   
      Even without the CEO title, Musk will retain significant control over Twitter as its owner. He has said he will oversee product, technology and software and systems operations, and will also transition to being the company’s executive chairman. 
   
      Yaccarino’s first day coincided with a Twitter Spaces livestream event Musk hosted with Democratic presidential hopeful and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, after a similar event Musk held with Ron DeSantis last month was largely overshadowed by technical glitches.
   
      At the event, Musk lamented Twitter’s fraught relationship with advertisers. Musk told Kennedy that Twitter had lost billions of dollars in advertising revenue due to Musk’s approach to content moderation on the social platform.
   
      “It’s definitely been extremely difficult,” Musk said. “Basically, our revenue is cut in half because we didn’t toe the line.”
   
      The Spaces conversation, which drew more than 60,000 listeners at its peak, was hosted by Musk, Kennedy and tech investor David Sacks. 
   
      Musk discussed the financial toll advertising boycotts have had on his business, saying it’s been a “huge struggle for Twitter to break even.”
   
      “We’re hoping to break even, but we’re not there yet,” he said.

With TripAdvisor and Elon Musk in the headlines for moving their companies from Delaware to Nevada, University of Virginia law professor ...","University of Virginia School of Law University of Virginia School of Law Professor Saw Elon Musk and TripAdvisor Move to Nevada Coming — 11 Years Ago Illustration by Warren Craghead Illustration by Warren Craghead Back in 2012, Professor Michal Barzuza spotted a trend in corporate law that continues to reverberate today. In fact, in one of today’s most high-profile courtroom battles, the shareholders of TripAdvisor.com cited the University of Virginia School of Law scholar for observations she made more than a decade ago: Nevada has deliberately created a legal Wild West in order to entice more companies to incorporate in the Silver State instead of Delaware, where half of businesses are incorporated. And some “controlling shareholders” — including corporate titans such as Elon Musk — are heeding the call. “Market Segmentation: The Rise of Nevada as a Liability-Free Jurisdiction,” which was published in the Virginia Law Review, was voted a top 10 corporate law paper that year. Perhaps the most striking finding of the paper related to Nevada’s corporate law. For decades, legal scholarship — and corporations textbooks — argued that Nevada copies Delaware law and applies the state’s cases to firms incorporated in Nevada, but Barzuza found sharp differences. In a Q&A, Barzuza discusses her discoveries about Nevada corporate law, the fascinating legislative history and the marketing strategy the state embarked on, and what the future might hold. It started in 1987, when Nevada adopted its exculpation statute. Nevada’s law was then significantly more protective of directors and officers than Delaware’s exculpation clause, because Nevada allowed firms to waive liability for directors and officers — not only for breaches of duty of care but also for breaching the duty of loyalty and of good faith. The only thing they couldn’t opt out of was liability for “fraud, intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law.” Then in 2001, Nevada made “no liability” mandatory and in 2003 changed it to be the default rule. In 2002, Nevada raised its negligible annual incorporation tax 10,000% — higher than most states but still significantly cheaper than Delaware’s tax — and started to market itself aggressively as “business-friendly.” In the legislative history, they said we need to differentiate Nevada from Delaware, otherwise everyone is going to incorporate in Delaware — if we want to attract firms, we have to offer more protection from liability. Some representatives said this is terrible, all the “scoundrels” are going to come here, it’s going to become a “hole in the wall,” and so forth. But eventually they were convinced to support these changes because they were promised that the additional tax fees would fund salary increases for public school teachers. There was a strong assumption in the literature that Nevada copies Delaware law, and even adopted all of its cases. All the papers around that time cited the same original source for the proposition that Nevada was just importing Delaware law wholesale. Yet, the source paper by William Carry merely said that “Nevada was trying to become Delaware of the West.”  And what’s funny is that the editors at The Onion, of all places, picked up on what Nevada was doing and poked fun at it. Shortly after this change in the corporate law, The Onion wrote a satirical headline saying, “Nevada to Phase Out Laws Altogether.” The story suggested that car theft, murder and rape would be legalized over a five-year period. Well, Elon Musk has, and others are now following … Nevada has long been second to Delaware in attracting out of state incorporations. After the legislature made “no liability” the default rule, we started seeing an increase in companies incorporating in Nevada. Delaware’s corporate law still attracts around half of all publicly traded companies. Of the other half, most incorporate in their home state. But Nevada attracted close to 10% of out-of-state corporations, second only to Delaware. I think it’s excessive protection that in some cases could be taken advantage of. Nevada adopted the law with the intention of attracting firms that are interested in more lax corporate law. Some of these firms may be ones that could benefit from regulation the most. In my paper with David Smith from UVA’s McIntire School of Commerce, “What Happens in Nevada? Self-Selecting into Lax Law,” which was published in the Review of Financial Studies, we found that Nevada “attracts firms that are 30% to 40% more likely to report financial results that later require restatement than firms incorporated in other states, including Delaware.”  It is indicative of aggressive or sloppy accounting, weak corporate control, manipulation of earnings or even fraud. It reduces a company’s credibility and tends to result in hits to their stock price. Most large companies don’t have a reason to go to Nevada. National law firms will continue to advise you to go to Delaware. Delaware attracts more than half of publicly traded companies. All the law firms are working in Delaware; all the financial firms are working in Delaware. Their courts are extremely efficient and the judges are experts in corporate law. Firms go to Nevada if they’re interested in more protection, either because they are exposed to litigation, or because their state provides less protection or both. Elon Musk already moved Twitter, which is a private company, into a new holding company he established in Nevada — X Holdings Inc. — and there are discussions that he’s trying to move Tesla there, though he will need to get shareholder vote for the move because it is a public company. Firms may have different motives for moving to Nevada. There’s a Tesla shareholders case in Delaware against Musk where the plaintiffs argue that he exerted too much influence on the Tesla board to award him a large compensation and bonus package. The court has previously found that he’s the controlling shareholder even though he owns less than 23% of the company, which under Delaware law exposes him to more litigation and higher judicial scrutiny. So that could be a motivation for him to move his firms to Nevada, where there’s much more limited liability for self-dealing transactions. Well, theoretically it could be, but the legislative intention to limit liability has been clear, and the courts follow this intention and state it explicitly in their verdicts. On top of that, in 2017, Nevada passed another amendment to its law stating Nevada rules should be applied by courts in a way that is consistent with state legislators’ intent, and not with Delaware law. In Delaware, there is now a line of cases about liability for oversight failure; for example, with Boeing there was a plane crash and the court found that the board didn’t fulfill their oversight duties sufficiently to prevent other crashes from the same cause. So those cases aren’t dismissed in Delaware, but they would be in Nevada. With TripAdvisor and Elon Musk’s moves in the news, we could see firms migrating to Nevada and potentially more shareholder suits to block firms from moving to Nevada. I think maybe Delaware will face concerns over losing more firms, especially ones with controlling shareholders. And maybe that will result in Delaware catering a little bit more to controlling shareholders — maybe they’ll be less quick to define shareholders as controlling shareholders.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/01/elon-musk-new-twitter-user-limits/,Elon Musk sets new daily Twitter post reading limits - The ...,20230601,"Jul 1, 2023 ... Elon Musk said verified accounts would be limited to reading 6000 posts per day while unverified users will be limited to 600.","Elon Musk announced Saturday that Twitter will temporarily limit the number of tweets users can read per day — with separate limits for paid and unpaid users — to combat computer programs that comb through posts to extract useful data from the platform. It’s unclear how long the limits will last, and what lifting them will depend on. Musk did not respond to a request for comment. Verified accounts will be limited to reading 10,000 posts per day while unverified accounts will have access to 1,000 per day, Musk tweeted. New unverified users who join the platform after Saturday’s announcement can access only 500 posts per day. The change came after significant backlash to initial tweet limits set by the company Saturday afternoon, allowing 6,000 tweets for verified users, 600 tweets for unverified and 300 for new profiles. The news follows the announcement by the Tesla and SpaceX CEO on Friday that tweets could not be viewed without being logged into an account. He described that change as a temporary measure to deter third parties from lifting data off the platform. In a tweet, Musk expressed dismay at what he characterized as “extreme levels of data scaping” by artificial intelligence companies. He again cited data scraping on Saturday as a reason for imposing the limit. Chatbots like ChatGPT rely on troves of data, mostly scraped from the internet. Musk’s post did not describe how the change will affect Twitter features like the audio conversation platform Spaces. However, following Musk’s post, many users began sharing screenshots of their Twitter homepages with the message “rate limit exceeded,” curbing their ability to view tweet replies or posts on their home feed. The website Downdetector indicated that user reports of Twitter malfunctions spiked at 8 a.m. Eastern on Saturday and continued throughout the day. The restrictions represent the latest drastic change by Musk, who headed up the social media company after purchasing it in October for $44 billion. After taking over, Musk restored many banned accounts, including that of former president Donald Trump, and stripped verification marks from public figures and instead offered the blue check marks to anyone willing to pay $8 a month. A year ago, Musk asked, ‘Is Twitter dying?’ He may have his answer. Advertisers have fled in droves, raising questions about how the company will make money. Amid what observers have characterized as a chaotic tenure, Musk in May appointed Linda Yaccarino, formerly NBCUniversal’s chairman of global advertising and partnerships, as Twitter’s CEO. Twitter’s changing user experience and frequent glitches have led to some users jumping to similar social media sites such as Mastodon and Bluesky. Meta has also reportedly proposed introducing its own Twitter clone. Bluesky, a platform backed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, bears a resemblance to Twitter. Bluesky said in a post on the platform Saturday afternoon that it was experiencing record high traffic after Musk’s announcement. The app, described as a decentralized social network, is currently invite-only and paused its sign-ups to respond to the spike in activity Saturday."
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/04/elon-musk-neuralink-approved-human-testing-concern,Elon Musk's brain implant company is approved for human testing ...,20230601,"Jun 5, 2023 ... Elon Musk's brain implant company is approved for human testing. How alarmed should we be? ... Elon Musk's brain-implant company Neuralink last ...","The billionaire’s record has raised concerns over Neuralink’s ability to responsibly oversee the development of such an invasive device Elon Musk’s brain-implant company Neuralink last week received regulatory approval to conduct the first clinical trial of its experimental device in humans. But the billionaire executive’s bombastic promotion of the technology, his leadership record at other companies and animal welfare concerns relating to Neuralink experiments have raised alarm. “I was surprised,” said Laura Cabrera, a neuroethicist at Penn State’s Rock Ethics Institute about the decision by the US Food and Drug Administration to let the company go ahead with clinical trials. Musk’s erratic leadership at Twitter and his “move fast” techie ethos raise questions about Neuralink’s ability to responsibly oversee the development of an invasive medical device capable of reading brain signals, Cabrera argued. “Is he going to see a brain implant device as something that requires not just extra regulation, but also ethical consideration?” she said. “Or will he just treat this like another gadget?” Neuralink is far from the first or only company working on brain interface devices. For decades, research teams around the world have been exploring the use of implants and devices to treat conditions such as paralysis and depression. Already, thousands use neuroprosthetics like cochlear implants for hearing. But the broad scope of capabilities Musk is promising from the Neuralink device have garnered skepticism from experts. Neuralink entered the industry in 2016 and has designed a brain-computer interface (BCI) called the Link – an electrode-laden computer chip that can be sewn into the surface of the brain and connects it to external electronics – as well as a robotic device that implants the chip. The design appears to use a novel kind of electrode, said John Donoghue, a neuroscientist at Brown University who led the team that developed the brain-computer interface ‘BrainGate’ to restore movement for people with paralysis. Musk has claimed Neuralink’s device could be used for a range of therapeutic uses, to treat conditions like blindness, paralysis, depression. But he has also said that the eventual aim is to create a “general population device” that could connect a user’s mind directly to supercomputers and help humans keep up with artificial intelligence. He has also suggested that the device could eventually extract and store thoughts, as “a backup drive for your non-physical being, your digital soul.” The company is not there yet. So far, Neuralink has tested its chips on animals. A video released in 2021 shows a monkey using the device to play the video game Pong with his mind and another from 2022 appeared to show a monkey typing on a computer telepathically. The FDA approval cleared the first hurdle toward a human clinical trial, but the scope, focus and design of any such study remains unclear. FDA applications and approval processes are not available to the public. As a private company, Neuralink is also not required to disclose such regulatory interactions to investors. Neuralink’s website indicates it is seeking participants with conditions including paralysis, blindness, deafness or the inability to speak. But the company did not respond to the Guardian’s request for further details. In a statement, a spokesperson for the FDA would only confirm that Neuralink was approved for an investigational device exemption (IDE) – the FDA process that allows a device to be used for clinical studies. Equally unclear is when such a trial would take place. The company would need to assemble an institutional review board to approve and monitor the research. The FDA’s approval last week comes after the regulator initially rejected Neuralink’s previous bid for clinical trials in 2022, citing “dozens of deficiencies” the company had to address before human testing, according to a report from Reuters. According to the news agency, safety concerns related to the implant’s lithium battery and potential overheating, questions over whether the machine’s small wires could migrate to other parts of the brain and that the device cannot be removed without damaging brain tissue. It is unclear how these concerns were resolved. The FDA declined to comment specifically on Neuralink’s application process, but the spokesperson commented generally that the agency has a “scientifically rigorous process to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of medical devices”. She added that the FDA has “a deep commitment to ensure the responsible and humane care of animals” involved in testing. Neuralink declined to comment on its plans for clinical trials. The FDA approval also comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Neuralink’s testing practices, and allegations of animal cruelty. The company has killed more than 1,500 animals since it began experimenting on them in 2018, according to another report from Reuters. While death of animal test subjects is not uncommon in labs, employees told the news service the mortality rate has been higher than necessary due to Musk’s grueling development timeline, which they allege has led to more mistakes and botched operations. Former employees interviewed by Reuters characterised some experiments as “hack jobs”. In one botched experiment, the wrong size of devices was installed in 25 of 60 pigs used for testing. In another, Neuralink’s device was accidentally implanted into the wrong vertebra of two different pigs during two separate surgeries, leading to their euthanasia due to pain and suffering. Neuralink did not respond to Reuters request for comment at the time. And the FDA declined to comment, citing laws keeping commercial information private. Most of the company’s founders, which included top scientists in the field, have quit. As of July 2022, only two of the eight founding members remained at Neuralink. “I would love to know what the FDA was thinking,” said L Syd M Johnson, a neuroethicist at the Center for Bioethics and Humanities in SUNY Upstate Medical University. “One of the concerns about Neuralink is that it’s not functioning in the way that many other research laboratories or organisations function,” Johnson added. “There’s concerns about the potential that they are performing a kind of sloppy work and that their data may not be reliable.” Sign up to Headlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion The allegations have led to ongoing investigations of Neuralink from multiple government agencies and members of Congress, including an inquiry from the Department of Agriculture over allegations of animal abuse and the Department of Transportation over mishandling of bio-hazardous materials across state lines. Earlier this month, Democratic representatives Earl Blumenauer and Adam Schiff called on the US Department of Agriculture to investigate conflicts of interest in the board responsible for oversight of animal testing at Neuralink. In an email, the USDA said it could not confirm or deny the investigation. The Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment. “I would want to wait to hear how those investigations go and what are the findings before giving the company a greenlight for trials,” said Cabrera. “If the allegations turn out to be true, it certainly raises concerns about the handling of human subjects’ brains.” Neuralink did not respond to a request for comment regarding the allegations. In a previous blog post responding to “recent articles” raising “questions around Neuralink’s use of research animals”, the company said it is “absolutely committed to working with animals in the most humane and ethical way possible”. It said at the time, in February 2022, it had “never received a citation from the USDA inspections of [its] facilities and animal care program”. The FDA does not typically inspect laboratory facilities as part of their clinical trial application reviews, said Victor Krauthamer, an adjunct biomedical engineering professor who spent three decades at the FDA. He said it is impossible to know if it did in this case. “The FDA is not really charged with animal protection – it is more concerned with the quality of the data,” he said. “If there were irregularities in the testing, maybe they should have done an inspection to see whether the results were trustworthy or not. But we don’t have enough information to know.” Musk’s track record of mishandling user data at Twitter also raises questions about his company’s ability to handle highly sensitive data extracted from the participants of its eventual clinical trials, both Johnson and Cabrera said. “There are some ethical concerns about privacy, anytime you’re using a brain device,” said Johnson. “Things to look out for are: will Neuralink have access to the brain data of the people that they implant these devices in? What are they going to do with it? And how are they going to protect user privacy?” Neuralink did not respond to questions about how it plans to handle the data of trial participants. Musk’s marketing sets Neuralink apart from other companies and teams at public institutions working in the BCI field, which have focused on using the devices to treat specific medical conditions such as seizures, Parkinson’s tremors or paralysis. The industry of “neuromodulation devices,” which record or stimulate neural activity, has surpassed $6bn. Synchron, another BCI manufacturer, received FDA approval to test brain implant devices in July 2021 and Blackrock Neurotech, which installs brain implants that enable people with paralysis to control digital devices and prosthetics, has been carrying out human trials for more than a decade. Musk, meanwhile, has said he founded the company largely in response to concerns that artificial intelligence would gain too much power over humans. The Neuralink device would allow humans to compete with new sentient AI, Musk has argued, stating “I created [Neuralink] specifically to address the AI symbiosis problem, which I think is an existential threat.” Even as Neuralink secures FDA approval for clinical trials, it will be a long road for its products to reach consumers, experts say. After being approved for clinical research, companies typically conduct at least two rounds of trials before applying for FDA approval to commercially market a device. Neuralink would first have to prove that its implant is safe and then establish its efficacy in treating specific conditions. The latter is a domain in which researchers around the world are doing difficult, but promising work, said Donoghue, the Brown University neuroscientist. “The technology to implant something in the brain is very mature, but where to put it in the brain and how to stimulate it is still being worked out, especially for complicated diseases,” he said. Still, he said he doesn’t like the hyped up marketing. Musk’s advertising of the Neuralink device has parallels to his plans for Twitter, which he purchased for $44bn in 2022 and has promised to pivot to an “everything app”, that can meet all users’ needs at once. “I think it dismisses the level of complexity of the whole thing,” Donoghue said. “Tackling each condition is a big effort, right? And it could take a long time. And so, I think we have to be very careful to respect the dignity of the people we’re trying to help.”"

He’s covered the tech industry for over a decade at The Information and other outlets. Here we go. After Elon Musk recently tweeted that he would be “up for a cage fight” with Zuckerberg, the Meta CEO shot back by posting a screenshot of Musk’s tweet with the caption “send me location.” I’ve confirmed that Zuckerberg’s post on his Instagram account is, in fact, not a joke, which means the ball is now in Musk’s court. “The story speaks for itself,” Meta spokesperson Iska Saric told me. After this story was published, Musk responded with two words: “Vegas Octagon.” He then tweeted: “I have this great move that I call ‘The Walrus,’ where I just lie on top of my opponent and do nothing.” The backstory here: since I recently reported more details about Meta’s forthcoming Twitter competitor, Musk has been taunting Zuckerberg on Twitter with zingers like “Zuck my 👅.” During an internal all-hands meeting at Meta last week, chief product officer Chris Cox told employees the company thinks creators want a version of Twitter that is “sanely run,” drawing cheers. “I’ve always thought that Twitter should have a billion people using it,” Zuckerberg said during a recent podcast interview with Lex Fridman.   In terms of tech billionaire CEOs literally fighting, Musk versus Zuckerberg would be as good as it gets. Musk, 51, has the upper hand on Zuckerberg in terms of sheer physical size, and he has talked about being in “real hard-core street fights” when he was growing up in South Africa. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg, 39, is an aspirational MMA fighter who is already winning Jiu-Jitsu tournaments. He also claims to have recently completed the grueling “Murph Challenge” workout in just under 40 minutes. Regardless of who would win, I think we can all agree that a Musk-versus-Zuckerberg match would be one of the most entertaining fights of all time. It needs to happen. Don’t back down now, Musk.

(Illustration by Warren Craghead, UVA School of Law)  Back in 2012, professor Michal Barzuza spotted a trend in corporate law that continues to reverberate today.

Self-Selecting into Lax Law,” which was published in the Review of Financial Studies, we found that Nevada “attracts firms that are 30% to 40% more likely to report financial results that later require restatement than firms incorporated in other states, including Delaware.” Q. What is the significance of accounting restatements? A. It is indicative of aggressive or sloppy accounting, weak corporate control, manipulation of earnings or even fraud. It reduces a company’s credibility and tends to result in hits to their stock price. Q. So how can Delaware compete to retain its corporate residents without going down the same path? A. Most large companies don’t have a reason to go to Nevada. National law firms will continue to advise you to go to Delaware. Delaware attracts more than half of publicly traded companies. All the law firms are working in Delaware; all the financial firms are working in Delaware. Their courts are extremely efficient and the judges are experts in corporate law. Firms go to Nevada if they’re interested in more protection, either because they are exposed to litigation, or because their state provides less protection, or both. Elon Musk already moved Twitter, which is a private company, into a new holding company he established in Nevada – X Holdings Inc. – and there are discussions that he’s trying to move Tesla there, though he will need to get shareholder vote for the move because it is a public company. Q. What does that tell you about Musk’s motivation? A. Firms may have different motives for moving to Nevada. There’s a Tesla shareholders case in Delaware against Musk where the plaintiffs argue that he exerted too much influence on the Tesla board to award him a large compensation and bonus package. The court has previously found that he’s the controlling shareholder even though he owns less than 23% of the company, which under Delaware law exposes him to more litigation and higher judicial scrutiny. So that could be a motivation for him to move his firms to Nevada, where there’s much more limited liability for self-dealing transactions. Q. Isn’t Nevada’s liability for “intentional misconduct” still a meaningful bar for bad actors? A. Well, theoretically it could be, but the legislative intention to limit liability has been clear, and the courts follow this intention and state it explicitly in their verdicts. On top of that, in 2017, Nevada passed another amendment to its law stating Nevada rules should be applied by courts in a way that is consistent with state legislators’ intent, and not with Delaware law. Q. What other types of things have directors and officers been held liable for in Delaware that they would be immune from in Nevada? A. In Delaware, there is now a line of cases about liability for oversight failure. For example, with Boeing there was a plane crash and the court found that the board didn’t fulfill its oversight duties sufficiently to prevent other crashes from the same cause. So those cases aren’t dismissed in Delaware, but they would be in Nevada. Q. What’s next? A. With TripAdvisor and Elon Musk’s moves in the news, we could see firms migrating to Nevada and potentially more shareholder suits to block firms from moving to Nevada. I think maybe Delaware will face concerns over losing more firms, especially ones with controlling shareholders. And maybe that will result in Delaware catering a little bit more to controlling shareholders – maybe they’ll be less quick to define shareholders as controlling shareholders. Melissa Castro Wyatt

Je zakladateľom,  riaditeľom a vedúcim inžinierom spoločnosti SpaceX, anjelským investorom, generálnym riaditeľom a produktovým architektom firmy Tesla, Inc., majiteľom, technickým riaditeľom a predsedom Twitteru, zakladateľom The Boring Company a X Corp., spoluzakladateľom Neuralinku a OpenAI a prezidentom filantropickej nadácie Musk Foundation. Podľa Bloomberg Billionaires Index a rebríčka Real Time Billionaires časopisu Forbes bol Elon Musk v júni 2023 najbohatším človekom na svete, a to najmä vďaka vlastníckym podielom v spoločnostiach Tesla a SpaceX, pričom jeho čistý majetok sa podľa Bloombergu odhaduje na približne 225 miliárd dolárov a podľa Forbesu na 235 miliárd dolárov.[1][2][3] 
Musk sa narodil v juhoafrickej Pretórii. Krátko navštevoval University of Pretoria a vo veku 18 rokov sa presťahoval do Kanady, kde získal občianstvo vďaka svojej matke narodenej v Kanade. O dva roky neskôr sa zapísal na Queen’s University a prestúpil na University of Pennsylvania, kde získal bakalárske tituly z ekonómie a fyziky. V roku 1995 sa presťahoval do Kalifornie, kde začal navštevovať Stanford University. Po dvoch dňoch štúdium prerušil a spolu s bratom Kimbalom založil softvérovú spoločnosť Zip2, ktorá poskytovala a licencovala novinám softvér na online sprievodcov mestami. V roku 1999 firmu Zip2 kúpila spoločnosť Compaq za 307 miliónov dolárov a Musk spoluzaložil internetovú banku X.com. V roku 2000 sa X.com zlúčila s firmou Confinity a vytvorila PayPal, ktorý v roku 2002 kúpila spoločnosť eBay za 1,5 miliardy dolárov. 
V roku 2002 Musk založil so 175,8 miliónmi dolárov spoločnosť SpaceX, ktorá poskytuje služby v oblasti kozmických letov. V roku 2004 bol prvým investorom výrobcu elektrických vozidiel Tesla Motors, Inc. (teraz Tesla, Inc.). Stal sa jej predsedom a produktovým architektom a v roku 2008 prevzal funkciu generálneho riaditeľa. V roku 2006 pomohol vytvoriť SolarCity, spoločnosť zaoberajúcu sa solárnou energiou, ktorú neskôr kúpila Tesla a stala sa z nej Tesla Energy. V roku 2015 spoluzaložil neziskovú spoločnosť OpenAI, ktorá sa zaoberá výskumom umelej inteligencie. V nasledujúcom roku spoluzaložil Neuralink – neurotechnologickú firmu vyvíjajúcu rozhrania mozog-počítač – a The Boring Company, ktorá sa zaoberá výstavbou tunelov. Musk tiež navrhol vysokorýchlostný dopravný systém hyperloop vactrain. V roku 2022 dokončil akvizíciu spoločnosti Twitter za 44 miliárd dolárov. 
Elon Musk tiež vyjadril názory, ktoré z neho urobili polarizujúcu osobnosť. Kritizovali ho za „nevedecké a zavádzajúce vyhlásenia vrátane šírenia dezinformácií“ o COVID-19. V roku 2018 ho Komisia pre kontrolu cenných papierov a burzy USA (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC) zažalovala za nepravdivý tweet, že zabezpečil financovanie súkromného prevzatia spoločnosti Tesla. Musk odstúpil z funkcie predsedu predstavenstva Tesly a v rámci dohody o urovnaní so SEC zaplatil pokutu vo výške 20 miliónov dolárov. 
Elon Musk sa narodil 28. júna 1971 v meste Pretória v provincii Transvaal v Južnej Afrike.[4] Je prvorodeným synom manželov Errola a Maye Muskových. Má dvoch mladších súrodencov – brata Kimbala (* 1972) a sestru Toscu (* 1974).[5][6] Jeho rodičia sa v roku 1980 rozviedli. Musk poväčšinou žil so svojím otcom na predmestí Pretórie.[7] Takto sa rozhodol dva roky po rozvode svojich rodičov, ktorý neustále odmietal.[8] Elon sa potom odcudzil od svojho otca, ktorého označil za „hroznú ľudskú bytosť“. Má tiež nevlastného brata a sestru.[9][10] 
V mladosti bol vášnivým čitateľom. V 10 rokoch sa začal zaujímať o počítače a používal počítač Commodore VIC-20.[11] Naučil sa programovať pomocou manuálu a v 12 rokoch vyvinul hru menom Blastar, v programovacom jazyku BASIC, ktorú predal za 500 dolárov.[12] Jeho mladosť ovplyvnila knižná séria Nadácia spisovateľa Isaaca Asimova, z ktorej si vzal myšlienku „mali by ste sa pokúsiť podniknúť množstvo akcií, ktoré pravdepodobne predĺžia civilizáciu, minimalizujú pravdepodobnosť temného veku a skrátia dĺžku temného veku, ak existuje“.[13][14] 
Elon navštevoval Waterkloofskú domácu prípravnú školu a Bryanstonskú strednú školu. potom vyštudoval Pretórijskú chlapčenskú strednú školu.[15] V škole ho ako najmladšieho šikanovali.[8] Hoci sa Muskov otec snažil, aby Elon vyštudoval Pretórijskú vysokú školu, Musk sa rozhodol presťahovať do Ameriky, a povedal „spomínam si, myslel som si a videl som, že Amerika je miesto, kde sú úžasné veci možnejšie, než v ostatných štátoch sveta“.[16] Musk vedel, že bude jednoduchšie dostať sa do USA cez Kanadu,[17] kam sa presťahoval v júni 1989, krátko pred svojimi 18. narodeninami, aj keď s tým jeho otec nesúhlasil. Do Kanady sa dostal vďaka kanadskému pasu, ktorý získal prostredníctvom svojej matky, ktorá sa narodila v Kanade.[18] 
Keď čakal na dokumenty s kanadským občianstvom, študoval päť mesiacov na University of Pretoria. V Kanade nastúpil na Queen’s University, aby sa vyhol narukovaniu do Juhoafrických obranných síl. Queen’s University opustil v roku 1992, aby študoval ekonómiu a fyziku na University of Pennsylvania, kde promoval v roku 1997 s bakalárskym titulom (Bachelor of Arts).[19][20][21] 
V lete 1994 sa Musk zúčastnil dvoch praxí v Silicon Valley. Prvá bola so start-upom, zameraným na uskladňovanie energie, ktorý sa volal Pinnacle Research Institute[22] a skúmal superkondenzátory. Druhou firmou bol paloaltský start-up menom Rocket Science Games.[22] Bruce Leak, ktorý Muska najal, povedal: „Mal nekonečnú energiu. Chlapci v dnešnej dobe nemajú potuchy o hardvéri, alebo ako veci fungujú, ale on mal minulosť hackera a nebál sa do toho ponoriť.“[23] V roku 1995 začal doktorandské štúdium aplikovanej fyziky na Stanford University v Kalifornii, ale už po dvoch dňoch štúdium ukončil, aby sa mohol pripojiť k internetovému boomu a založiť svoju prvú firmu Zip2.[24] 
Zip2 založil so svojim bratom Kimbalom, tretím zakladateľom bol investor Greg Kouri.[25] V roku 1999 firmu predali za 307 miliónov dolárov spoločnosti Compaq,[25] ktorá službu začlenila do svojho vyhľadávača AltaVista.[26] Musk za svoj podiel dostal 22 miliónov dolárov.[27] V roku 1999 spoluzaložil platobnú spoločnosť X.com. Tá sa v roku 2000 zlúčila s firmou Confinity a premenovala na PayPal.[28] Musk spoločnosť viedol do septembra 2000. V marci 2002 bola spoločnosť zalistovaná na burze NASDAQ[28] a ešte v októbri toho istého roka ju kúpil eBay za 1,5 miliardy dolárov.[29] Musk ako druhý najväčší akcionár dostal 165 miliónov dolárov.[27] 
V roku 2002 Musk založil kozmickú spoločnosť SpaceX.[27] V roku 2004 prvýkrát zainvestoval do automobilky Tesla a začal sa podieľať na jej vedení. Svoj podiel postupne zvyšoval, až sa stal jej najväčším akcionárom a od roku 2008 aj CEO. V roku 2010 bola spoločnosť zalistovaná na burze NASDAQ. V roku 2006 ako prvý investoval do spoločnosti SolarCity, ktorá sa v Spojených štátoch zaoberá inštaláciou solárnych panelov pre obytné domy.[30] Spoločnosť založili jeho bratranci Peter a Lyndon Riveovci.[27] V roku 2012 bola zalistovaná na burze NASDAQ[31] a v roku 2016 ju kúpila Tesla.[27] V roku 2016 tiež založil spoločnosť The Boring Company, ktorá sa zameriava na vytváranie tunelov a hyperloop trás na zefektívnenie dopravy. 
V priebehu roka 2020 sa jeho imanie zhodnotilo približne o 77 %, a to najmä vďaka prudkému rastu ceny akcií Tesly, ktorá zvýšila svoju trhovú hodnotu o 743 %. Dňa 7. januára 2021 sa Musk stal podľa rebríčka agentúry Bloomberg najbohatším človekom na svete s hodnotou majetku 185 miliárd dolárov, a predbehol tak Jeffa Bezosa. O dva dni neskôr jeho majetok prekročil hranicu 200 miliárd.[32] Okrem asi pätinového podielu v Tesle držal približne 48 % akcií firmy SpaceX.[33][34] Dňa 13. apríla 2022 urobil doterajším akcionárom ponuku na kúpu 100 % akcií sociálnej siete Twitter za 54,20 dolára za akciu v celkovej hodnote 43 miliárd dolárov. Dňa 25. apríla bolo oznámené, že Twitter je pripravený Muskovu ponuku prijať.[35][36][37][38] V októbri 2022 Musk dokončil akvizíciu Twitteru za 44 miliárd dolárov.[39] V decembri 2022 ho v dôsledku poklesu ceny akcií automobilky Tesla a akvizície Twitteru na prvom mieste rebríčka najbohatších ľudí sveta podľa agentúry Bloomberg vystriedal Bernard Arnault.[40] Potom, čo v decembri 2022 používatelia Twitteru hlasovali v Muskom vytvorenej ankete pre jeho odchod z pozície generálneho riaditeľa spoločnosti, oznámil, že tak urobí, len čo za seba nájde náhradu. V máji 2023 uviedol, že ho vo funkcii nahradí žena.[41] 
Elon Musk má americké, kanadské a juhoafrické občianstvo.[42][43] V rokoch 2000 až 2008 bol ženatý s kanadskou spisovateľkou Justine Wilsonovou. Ich prvý syn Nevada sa narodil v roku 2002, ale zomrel v 10 mesiacoch v dôsledku syndrómu náhleho úmrtia dojčaťa. V roku 2004 sa im narodili dvojičky Griffina a Xaviera. V roku 2006 trojčatá Damiana, Saxona a Kaie.[27] V rokoch 2010 až 2012 a znova v rokoch 2013 až 2016 bol ženatý s anglickou herečkou Talulah Rileyovou.[8] Dňa 7. mája 2018 sa objavil na americkom Met Gala po boku kanadskej umelkyne Grimes,[44] s ktorou začal žiť. Dňa 5. mája 2020 sa Muskovi a Grimes narodil syn. Podľa Muskovho vyjadrenia na Twitteri dostal meno X Æ A-12 Musk.[45] Kalifornské zákony toto meno ale nedovolili, preto svoje dieťa premenoval na X Æ A-Xii Musk.[46] V roku 2021 sa rozišli.[47] 
Elon sa tiež objavil v seriáloch Simpsonovci, Teória veľkého tresku, Mestečko South Park, Rick and Morty a hral vo filmoch Iron Man 2, Prečo práve on?, Machete zabíja a Ďakujeme, že fajčíte. Až do konca roku 2020 býval v Los Angeles, ale od decembra toho istého roka sa zdržiava v Texase.[48] V relácii Saturday Night Live v živom vysielaní 8. mája 2021 povedal, že má Aspergerov syndróm.[49] V júli 2022 denník Insider zverejnil súdne dokumenty, z ktorých vyplýva, že Musk mal v novembri 2021 dvojčatá so Shivon Zilisovou, riaditeľkou operácií a špeciálnych projektov spoločnosti Neuralink.[50][51] 
Prostredníctvom kozmickej spoločnosti SpaceX sa znížiť náklady na vesmírne cestovanie. Práve SpaceX sa stala prvou firmou, ktorá uviedla do prevádzky znovupoužiteľné kozmické rakety. Hlavným cieľom SpaceX je začatie kolonizácie Marsu.[52] 
Musk tvrdí, že je „veľká šanca na existenciu jednoduchého života na iných planétach“, ale „otázka je, či existuje inteligentný život v známom vesmíre“.[53] Neskôr vysvetlil svoje „nádeje“, že „inteligentný život v známom vesmíre existuje“ tým, že je to „pravdepodobnejšie, ako keby nebol, ale je to len odhad“. 
Často hovorí o potenciálnom nebezpečenstve umelej inteligencie (UI), označuje ju za „najvážnejšiu hrozbu prežitia ľudskej rasy“. Počas interview na sympóziu MIT opísal UI ako „najväčšiu existenčnú hrozbu“ a ďalej „čím ďalej, tým viac si myslím, že by mala existovať nejaká regulačná ochrana, možno na národnej a medzinárodnej úrovni, aby sme si boli istí, že neurobíme nejakú hlúposť“. Vytvorenie umelej inteligencie opísal ako „vyvolanie démona“.[54] 
Napriek tomu Musk investoval do firiem vyvíjajúcich UI DeepMind a Vicarious (ďalšia spoločnosť pracujúca na zvýšenie inteligencie strojov) a v roku 2015 spoluzaložil výskumnú organizáciu OpenAI. No Musk vysvetlil, že tieto investície „sa nevykonali z pohľadu ich návratnosti, ale kvôli dozoru nad súčasným stavom vývoja v odbore“. 
Elon Musk tiež hovorí: „Vo filmoch na túto tému, ako napríklad Terminátor, sa udalosti vyvíjajú hrozivo. A my by sme sa mali postarať, aby boli dobré, nie zlé.“[55]

Ông được bầu làm thành viên của Hiệp hội Hoàng gia (FRS) vào năm 2018.[15][16] Vào tháng 12 năm 2016, ông được xếp hạng 21 trong danh sách Những người quyền lực nhất thế giới của Forbes,[17] và được xếp hạng đầu tiên trong danh sách Forbes của các nhà lãnh đạo sáng tạo nhất năm 2019.[18] Tính đến ngày 7 tháng 1 năm 2021, giá trị tài sản ròng của ông ước tính khoảng 188,5 tỷ đô la và ông được Bloomberg Billionaires Index và Forbes the World's Real-Time Billionaires xếp hạng là người giàu nhất trên thế giới.[19][20] Ông là người nắm giữ chức vụ CEO lâu nhất so với bất kỳ hãng sản xuất ô tô nào trên toàn cầu.[21] 
Elon Musk sinh ra và lớn lên ở Pretoria, Nam Phi. Ông từng học một thời gian ngắn tại Đại học Pretoria trước khi chuyển đến Canada năm 17 tuổi để vào Đại học Queen. Ông chuyển sang Đại học Pennsylvania hai năm sau đó, nơi ông nhận bằng cử nhân kinh tế tại Trường Wharton và bằng cử nhân vật lý từ College of Arts and Sciences. Sau đó, ông chuyển đến California vào năm 1995 để theo đuổi bằng tiến sĩ ngành vật lý ứng dụng và khoa học vật liệu tại Đại học Stanford nhưng đã quyết định theo đuổi sự nghiệp kinh doanh thay vì ghi danh theo học.[22] 
Elon cùng với em trai, Kimbal, đồng sáng lập ra Zip2, một công ty phần mềm web và được hãng Compaq mua lại với giá 340 triệu USD vào năm 1999. Sau đó, Elon Musk thành lập X.com, một ngân hàng trực tuyến. Nó được sáp nhập với Confinity vào năm 2000, công ty đã ra mắt PayPal vào năm trước và sau được eBay mua lại với giá 1,5 tỷ đô la vào tháng 10 năm 2002.[10][23][24][25] 
Vào tháng 5 năm 2002, Musk thành lập SpaceX đơn vị chế tạo hàng không vũ trụ kiêm công ty dịch vụ vận tải không gian, nắm giữ cương vị CEO kiêm nhà thiết kế chính. Ông gia nhập Tesla Motors, Inc. (nay là Tesla, Inc.), công ty sản xuất xe điện vào năm 2004, một năm sau khi công ty được thành lập,[10] và trở thành CEO và kiến trúc sư sản phẩm của hãng. Năm 2006, ông đã giúp lập ra SolarCity, một công ty dịch vụ năng lượng mặt trời (hiện là công ty con của Tesla). Năm 2015, Musk đồng sáng lập OpenAI, một công ty nghiên cứu phi lợi nhuận nhằm mục đích thúc đẩy trí tuệ nhân tạo thân thiện. Vào tháng 7 năm 2016, ông đồng sáng lập Neuralink, một công ty công nghệ tập trung vào phát triển giao diện máy tính trí tuệ. Vào tháng 12 năm 2016, Musk thành lập The Boring Company, một công ty xây dựng cơ sở hạ tầng và đường hầm tập trung vào các đường hầm được tối ưu hóa cho xe điện. 
Ngoài việc theo đuổi công việc kinh doanh chính của mình, Musk đã hình dung ra một hệ thống giao thông tốc độ cao được gọi là Hyperloop. Musk đã nói rằng các mục tiêu của SpaceX, Tesla và SolarCity xoay quanh tầm nhìn của ông là ""thay đổi thế giới và giúp đỡ nhân loại"".[26] Mục tiêu của ông bao gồm giảm sự nóng lên toàn cầu thông qua sản xuất và tiêu thụ năng lượng bền vững; làm giảm nguy cơ tuyệt chủng của con người bằng cách thiết lập một thuộc địa của con người trên sao Hỏa.[27][28] 
Elon Musk sinh ngày 28 tháng 6 năm 1971 tại Pretoria, Transvaal, Nam Phi.[29][30] Elon là con trai của bà Maye Musk (nhũ danh Haldeman) là một người mẫu và chuyên gia dinh dưỡng sinh ra tại Saskatchewan, Canada, lớn lên tại Nam Phi[31][32][33] và ông Errol Musk, một kỹ sư cơ điện, phi công và thủy thủ người Nam Phi.[34] Elon có một em trai là Kimbal (sinh năm 1972) và một em gái Tosca (sinh năm 1974).[38][33] 
Ông ngoại là Tiến sĩ Joshua Haldeman có quốc tịch Canada nhưng sinh ra tại Mỹ.[39] Bà nội là người gốc Anh và cũng có tổ tiên là người nhập cư gốc Đức đầu tiên tại vùng đất Pennsylvania.[40][41] Sau khi cha mẹ ly hôn vào năm 1980, Elon chọn sống với cha ở ngoại ô thành phố Pretoria,[40] một lựa chọn mà Elon đưa ra hai năm sau khi bố mẹ ly thân nhưng sau đó cảm thấy hối hận.[42] Elon bị cha ghẻ lạnh, ông đã gọi cha mình là ""một con người khủng khiếp"".[42] Elon cũng có hai người anh em cùng cha khác mẹ.[43][44] 
Từ nhỏ, Elon đã là một độc giả cuồng nhiệt[45] Vào năm 10 tuổi, ông đã có hứng thú với máy tính trong khi sử dụng Commodore VIC-20.[46] Elon đã học lập trình máy tính bằng cách sử dụng một hướng dẫn và đến năm 12 tuổi, đã bán mã nguồn của một video game dựa trên BASIC tạo ra Blastar cho tạp chí PC and Office Technology với giá khoảng 500 đô la.[47][48] Danh mục đọc của Elon gồm bộ sách Foundation của Isaac Asimov từ đó rút ra bài học rằng ""bạn nên cố gắng thực hiện tập hợp các hành động có khả năng kéo dài nền văn minh, giảm thiểu xác suất của thời kỳ đen tối và giảm độ dài của thời kỳ đen tối nếu có"".[42] 
Thời đi học, ông chịu sự bắt nạt nghiêm trọng và đã từng phải nhập viện sau khi bị một nhóm bạn học ném xuống cầu thang.[42][45][49][50]
Elon theo học trường dự bị Waterkloof House Preparatory School và trung học Bryanston High School[49] sau đó tốt nghiệp tại trường trung học Pretoria Boys High School.[50] 
Mặc dù người cha nhất quyết muốn Elon vào học đại học tại Pretoria, nhưng Elon đã quyết tâm chuyển đến Hoa Kỳ, ông đã kể lại rằng ""Tôi nhớ mình đã suy nghĩ và thấy rằng nước Mỹ là nơi có thể có những điều tuyệt vời hơn bất kỳ quốc gia nào trên thế giới.""[51] Ông biết rằng việc đến Hoa Kỳ từ Canada sẽ dễ dàng hơn và chuyển đến đó trái với mong muốn của cha mình vào tháng 6 năm 1989, ngay trước sinh nhật thứ 18.[52][53] Sau khi có được hộ chiếu Canada thông qua bà Maye, người mẹ có gốc gác từ Canada.[54][55] 
Trong thời gian đợi giấy tờ từ phía Canada, Elon theo học Đại học Pretoria khoảng 5 tháng.[56] Khi chuyển đến sống tại Canada, Musk ghi danh vào Đại học Queen tại Kingston năm 1989 để tránh phải gia nhập nghĩa vụ quân sự bắt buộc của Quân đội Nam Phi.[57] 
Ông từ bỏ Đại học Queen năm 2000 để theo học ngành kinh tế và vật lý thuộc Đại học Pennsylvania; tốt nghiệp năm 1997 với bằng Cử nhân Kinh tế tại Trường Wharton thuộc Đại học Pennsylvania và bằng Cử nhân Khoa học Vật lý từ College of Arts and Sciences của Đại học Pennsylvania.[58][59][60][61][62] 
Năm 1994, Musk đã tổ chức hai đợt thực tập tại Thung lũng Silicon vào mùa hè: tại một công ty khởi nghiệp lưu trữ năng lượng có tên là Pinnacle Research Institute, chuyên nghiên cứu các siêu âm điện phân để lưu trữ năng lượng và công ty khởi nghiệp Rocket Science Games tại Palo Alto.[63] 
Bruce Leak, cựu kỹ sư trưởng đằng sau QuickTime của Apple, người đã thuê Musk, lưu ý: ""Anh ta có năng lượng vô biên. Bọn trẻ ngày nay không biết gì về phần cứng hay cách thức hoạt động, nhưng anh ta có một nền tảng hacker PC và chỉ để tìm ra mọi thứ mà không sợ điều gì.""[64] 
Năm 1995, Musk được nhận vào chương trình tiến sĩ về vật lý năng lượng/khoa học vật liệu tại Đại học Stanford ở California.[22] Háo hức theo đuổi các cơ hội trong thời đại bùng nổ internet, tuy nhiên, thay vào đó, ông quyết định ra mắt công ty đầu tiên của mình, Zip2 Corporation. 
Năm 1995, Musk khởi nghiệp với dự án Zip2, cung cấp phần mềm ấn hành nội dung số cho các tổ chức mới, cùng với em trai Kimbal Musk.[65]. Errol Musk đã tài trợ cho họ 28,000 đô la đầu tiên.[66] 
Năm 1999, bộ phận AltaVista của Compaq mua lại Zip2 với 307 triệu đô la tiền mặt và 34 triệu đô la cổ phiếu.[67] 
Musk đồng sáng lập X.com, một công ty về dịch vụ tài chính trực tuyến và thanh toán qua email tháng 3 năm 1999. Một năm sau đó, trong một cuộc sáp nhập 50/50 về vốn[68], X.com mua lại Confinity,[69] một hãng vận hành một hệ thống thanh toán đấu giá có quy mô tương tự như X.com, gọi tên là Paypal. Musk đã sắp xếp thương vụ này do niềm tin vào việc chuyển khoản trực tiếp đang nở rộ của công nghệ P2P[69]. Musk tin rằng nhánh con Confinity sẽ trở thành phương tiện cần thiết để tích hợp và phát triển một nền tảng thanh toán giữa các cá nhân bên trong X.com.[69] Công ty kết hợp ban đầu thu nhận X.com làm tên tập đoàn, nhưng vào tháng 2 năm 2001, X.com đổi tên chính thức của nó thành Paypal Inc. Musk đã cổ vũ mạnh mẽ cho trọng tâm của một Paypal mới nhằm vào hệ thống thanh toán toàn cầu và rời khỏi những sự cung cấp tài chính lõi của X.com[70]. 
Sự phát triển ban đầu của PayPal phần lớn là do một chiến dịch phát triển rộng khắp thành công của Musk.[71] Tháng 10 năm 2002, PayPal được eBay mua lại với giá 1.5 tỷ giá trị cổ phiếu.[72]. Vào thời điểm bán, Musk, cổ đông lớn nhất của công ty, nắm 11.7% cổ phiếu của PayPal[73]. 
Musk thành lập công ty thứ ba của ông, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), vào tháng 6 năm 2002[74]
và hiện là CEO và Giám đốc Kỹ thuật của tập đoàn này. SpaceX phát triển và chế tạo các phương tiện phóng ra không gian với trọng tâm hướng vào việc phát triển công nghệ tên lửa. Hai tên lửa đầu tiên của công ty là Falcon 1 và Falcon 9 và phi thuyền đầu tiên của nó mang tên Dragon.[75] 
SpaceX đã giành được hợp đồng 1,6 tỷ đô la với NASA ngày 23 tháng 12 năm 2008, cho 12 chuyến bay của Falcon 9 và Dragon vào Trạm Vũ trụ Quốc tế ISS, thay thế cho Space Shuttle của NASA sau khi nó hết thời gian hoạt động năm 2011. Ban đầu, Falcon 9/Dragon sẽ thay thế chức năng vận tải hàng hóa của Shuttle và việc vận chuyển phi hành gia sẽ được thực hiện bởi Tàu vũ trụ Soyuz. Tuy nhiên, SpaceX đã thiết kế Falcon 9/Dragon nhằm vào việc vận chuyển phi hành gia và Ủy ban Augustine (Cơ quan Hoa Kỳ phụ trách các chuyến bay có người lái vào vũ trụ) đã khuyến nghị việc vận tải hành khách bởi các công ty thương mại như SpaceX.[76] 
Musk nói rằng ý tưởng về công nghệ vũ trụ của mình chịu ảnh hưởng từ series ""Foundation"" của Issac Asimov [77], và xem việc khai phá vũ trụ như một bước quan trọng trong việc mở rộng—nếu không nói là bảo tồn-sự hiểu biết của đời sống con người.[78] Musk từng nói rằng sự sống trải trên nhiều hành tinh khác nhau có thể đóng vai trò như một hàng rào ngăn chặn những mối đe dọa sự tồn vong của loài người. ""Một thiên thạch hay một siêu núi lửa có thể hủy diệt chúng ta, và chúng ta đối mặt với những thảm họa mà khủng long chưa từng biết tới: một virus được lập trình, một sự hình thành do sơ suất một vi lỗ đen, sự ấm lên toàn cầu thảm họa hoặc một công nghệ thậm chí chưa được biết đến nào đó có thể báo hiệu sự tiêu vong của chúng ta. Nhân loại đã tiến hóa hàng triệu năm, nhưng trong 60 năm gần đây các vũ khí nguyên tử tạo nên nguy cơ tiêu diệt chính chúng ta. Sớm hay muộn, chung ta phải mở rộng sự sống ra ngoài trái cầu xanh lam này-hoặc là tuyệt chủng."" [79] Mục tiêu của Musk là giảm giá thành của một chuyến bay có chở người xuống còn 1/10 hiện nay.[80] Ông thành lập SpaceX với 100 triệu đô la từ tài sản ban đầu của mình. Ông hiện vẫn đóng vai trò điều hành lẫn chỉ đạo kĩ thuật của công ty đóng ở Hawthorne, California này.[81] Trong tiểu sử của Ashlee Vance, Musk tuyên bố rằng ông muốn thành lập một thuộc địa của loài người trên sao Hỏa vào năm 2040, với dân số khoảng 80.000 người.[46] Musk tuyên bố rằng, do bầu khí quyển của sao Hỏa thiếu oxy, nên tất cả các phương tiện giao thông trên sao Hỏa đều sẽ sử dụng động cơ điện (ô tô điện, tàu điện, Hyperloop, máy bay điện) [82]. Musk tuyên bố vào tháng 6 năm 2016 rằng hai tàu đầu tiên của SpaceX sẽ hạ cánh xuống sao Hỏa vào năm 2022 mang theo các thiết bị cần thiết để xây dựng các trạm năng lượng và cơ sở hạ tầng hỗ trợ sự sống. Đến năm 2024, các phi hành gia của SpaceX sẽ chính thức đặt chân lên hành tinh Đỏ, mang theo tham vọng chinh phục sao Hỏa của nhân loại [83]. Trong một cuộc phỏng vấn với Axios năm 2018, Tỷ phú Elon Musk tuyên bố ông muốn là người đầu tiên đặt chân lên Sao Hỏa. 
Trong 7 năm, SpaceX đã thiết kế dòng thiết bị phóng Falcon và phi thuyền đa mục đích Dragon từ chỗ không có gì. Tháng 9 năm 2009, tên lửa Falcon 1 trở thành phương tiện nhiên liệu lỏng đầu tiên do tư nhân hùn vốn đưa được một vệ tinh vào quỹ đạo Trái Đất. NASA đã chọn SpaceX để tham gia vào dự án đầu tiên tin cậy các công ty tư nhân vận chuyển hàng hóa tới ISS. Hợp đồng này, có giá trị từ 1.6 tỉ tới 3.1 tỷ đô la, là một dấu mốc quan trọng của trạm vũ trụ trong việc vận chuyển hàng tới trạm và trở lại. Bên cạnh những dịch vụ này, mục tiêu của SpaceX còn bao gồm việc đồng thời hạ giá các chuyến bay tới quỹ đạo và cải thiện độ tin cậy lên cỡ mười lần, trong khi tạo nên thiết bị phóng ra quỹ đạo đầu tiên có thể hoàn toàn tái sử dụng. Tuy hiện đang trong giai đoạn tìm cách đưa người ra ISS, năm 2011 Musk khẳng định mục đích cá nhân của ông là đưa người ra khai phá và định cư ở Sao Hỏa, trong khoảng 10-20 năm nữa.[84]
Ngày 25 tháng 5 năm 2012, tàu SpaceX Dragon đáp xuống ISS, ghi dấu mốc lịch sử lần đầu tiên có một công ty tư nhân phóng và đáp thành công một phương tiên xuống Trạm Vũ trụ Quốc tế [85]. 
Musk tin rằng chìa khóa để khiến việc du hành vũ trụ trở nên rẻ và hợp túi tiền hơn là phải làm cho tên lửa có khả năng tái sử dụng, mặc dù hầu hết các chuyên gia trong ngành vũ trụ đều không tin rằng tên lửa có khả năng tái sử dụng là một điều khả thi. Thứ hai ngày 21 tháng 12 năm 2015, SpaceX bắn một tên lửa vào không gian và hạ cánh nó trở về mặt đất, trong trạng thái hoàn toàn nguyên vẹn. Không chỉ tạo ra một bước ngoặt lịch sử trong việc chế tạo tên lửa tái sử dụng, thành công nói trên có sức ảnh hưởng rất lớn đến tương lai của ngành du lịch không gian [86]. 
Vào ngày 6 tháng 2 năm 2018, SpaceX đã phóng thành công Falcon Heavy, tên lửa có công suất cao thứ tư từng được chế tạo (sau Saturn V, Energia và N1) đồng thời là tên lửa mạnh nhất hoạt động trong năm 2018 [87]. 
SpaceX là nhà sản xuất động cơ tên lửa tư nhân lớn nhất thế giới và hiện đang nắm giữ kỷ lục về tỷ lệ lực đẩy trên trọng lượng cao nhất cho động cơ tên lửa (Merlin 1D) [88][89]. SpaceX đã sản xuất hơn 100 động cơ Merlin 1D và đưa vào hoạt động. Mỗi động cơ Merlin 1D có thể nâng được trọng lượng tương đương với 40 chiếc xe hơi gia đình theo chiều thẳng đứng. Kết hợp lại, 9 động cơ Merlin trong tên lửa Falcon 9 giai đoạn đầu tạo ra lực đẩy từ 5,8 đến 6,7 MN (1,3 đến 1,5 triệu pound), tùy thuộc vào độ cao [90]. 
Vào cuối năm 2017, SpaceX đã tiết lộ thiết kế cho phương tiện phóng và hệ thống tàu vũ trụ thế hệ tiếp theo tên là Starship. SpaceX đang thiết kế chiếc tên lửa đặc biệt này với hai bộ phận có thể tái sử dụng là bộ phận phóng chính cao 187m và chiếc tàu vũ trụ cao 153m trên đỉnh. Sau khi chế tạo thành công, chiếc tên lửa BFR sẽ cao hơn tượng Nữ thần tự do khoảng 15%, có thể mang theo 100 phi hành gia và 150 tấn hàng hóa lên quỹ đạo Trái đất. Khi lên được quỹ đạo Trái đất, BFR có thể tiếp nhiên liệu trong không gian và tiếp tục hành trình tới Sao Hỏa trong 6 tháng. Tên lửa Starship sẽ là tên lửa lớn nhất và mạnh nhất lịch sử từ trước đến nay, du định BFR sẽ thay thế hoàn toàn Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy và Dragon trong những năm 2020[cần dẫn nguồn]. 
Tesla Motors được Martin Eberhard và Marc Tarpening gây vốn vào tháng 7 năm 2003, Musk đầu tư thành lập tháng 2 năm 2004 và trở thành Chủ tịch Hội đồng Quản trị; nhưng đam mê của ông với ô tô điện đã có từ thời còn trẻ[91]. Do ảnh hưởng của khủng hoàng tài chính thế giới năm 2008 và kéo theo đó là một đợt cắt giảm nhân lực bắt buộc ở Tesla, Musk buộc phải đảm nhận thêm vị trí CEO[92]. Ông khẳng định đường hướng của công ty là đầu tiên phát triển những chiếc xe thể thao hạng sang để thu hút sự quan tâm tới xe điện và kiếm lợi nhuận ban đầu nhằm nuôi mục đích lâu dài là cung cấp ô tô điện phổ biến cho người bình dân, giảm đáng kể lượng tiêu thụ dầu thô toàn cầu
[93][94]. 
Musk đóng vai trò tích cực trong công ty và đặc biệt chỉ đạo thiết kế các mẫu sản phẩm cũng như định hướng chiến lược, nhưng dù là CEO ông không liên hệ sâu vào việc điều hành kinh doanh hàng ngày[95]. Ông được cho là nắm 32% cổ phần tại Tesla, tập đoàn này được định giá 13.9 tỷ đô la vào tháng 7 năm 2013[96][97] 
Mẫu xe điện thể thao đầu tiên, Tesla Roadster 2008, với giá khởi điểm 109 nghìn đô la/chiếc bán được khoảng 2500 đơn vị tới 31 quốc gia, đồng thời bản thử nghiệm của nó nhận giải ""Phát minh xuất sắc nhất"" năm 2006 của tạp chí Time trong lĩnh vực ""Phát minh về vận tải""[98].[99]. Tesla Model S, chiếc sedan xuất hiện trên thị trường tháng 6 năm 2012 đã trở thành hiện tượng của năm, đạt một loạt giải thưởng như giải Xe tiêu biểu nhất của năm 2013 của tạp chí Automobile[100]. Nó bán được 2650 chiếc trong năm 2012 ở Hoa Kỳ[98] và 4900 chiếc tại Bắc Mỹ chỉ trong quý I 2013, trở thành mẫu xe điện bán chạy nhất trong khu vực[101]. Model X, mẫu xe SUV-minivan, được giới thiệu tháng 9 năm 2012 và được bán ra năm 2015[102]. 
. Thế hệ thứ ba của xe điện Tesla là Model 3 ra mắt vào năm 2016. 
Bên cạnh việc bán xe điện thương hiệu Tesla, Tesla Motors còn cung cấp động cơ điện cho Mercedes-Benz, Toyota và Musk dự tính sẽ cung cấp một mạng lưới các trạm sạc điện siêu nhanh cho ô tô trên khắp Bắc Mỹ trong năm 2013[103] Tháng 5 năm 2013, Tesla Motors cho thấy quý đầu tiên hoạt động có lợi nhuận kể từ khi nó niêm yết cổ phiếu năm 2011[104]. 
Trong một cuộc phỏng vấn vào tháng 5 năm 2013 với All Things Digital, Musk nói rằng để khắc phục những hạn chế về phạm vi của ô tô điện, Tesla đang mở rộng mạng lưới các trạm tăng áp, tăng gấp ba số trên bờ Đông và Tây của Hoa Kỳ vào tháng 6, với kế hoạch nhiều hơn mở rộng trên khắp Bắc Mỹ, bao gồm Canada, trong suốt cả năm.[105] Tính đến ngày 29 tháng 1 năm 2016, Musk sở hữu khoảng 28,9 triệu cổ phiếu Tesla, tương đương với khoảng 22% cổ phần công ty [106][107]. 
Vào năm 2014, Musk tuyên bố rằng Tesla sẽ cho phép các bằng sáng chế công nghệ của nó được sử dụng bởi bất kỳ ai có thiện chí trong nỗ lực lôi kéo các nhà sản xuất ô tô để tăng tốc độ phát triển của ô tô điện. ""Thực tế không may là các chương trình xe điện (hoặc chương trình cho bất kỳ chiếc xe nào không đốt hydrocarbon) tại các nhà sản xuất lớn đều không tồn tại, chiếm trung bình ít hơn 1% tổng doanh số bán xe của họ"", Musk nói [108] 
Vào tháng 2 năm 2016, Musk tuyên bố rằng ông đã mua được tên miền Tesla.com từ Stu Grossman, người đã sở hữu nó từ năm 1992, và thay đổi trang chủ của Tesla thành tên miền đó [109]. 
Ủy ban Chứng khoán và Sàn giao dịch Mỹ (SEC) đã chính thức khởi kiện Elon Musk vào tháng 9 năm 2018 vì hành vi gian lận và thao túng thị trường. Nguyên nhân là do CEO Elon Musk đã đăng trên trang Twitter cá nhân của mình, ý muốn mua lại toàn bộ Tesla và biến nó trở thành một công ty tư nhân [110][111]. Kết quả là, Musk và Tesla đã bị phạt 20 triệu đô la, và Musk buộc phải từ chức chủ tịch Tesla trong khi vẫn là CEO của Tesla [112]. 
Vào tháng 1 năm 2019, Musk đã tới Trung Quốc để khởi công Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory, đây là nhà máy quy mô lớn đầu tiên của công ty bên ngoài Hoa Kỳ. Một phần trong chuyến thăm Trung Quốc, Musk cũng đã gặp thủ tướng Trung Quốc Li Keqiang [113]. Trong quá trình trao đổi, Musk thú nhận tình yêu của ông dành cho Trung Quốc và mong muốn ông có thể đến thăm Trung Quốc thường xuyên hơn, thủ tướng Trung Quốc đã nói rằng ""Chúng tôi có thể cấp cho ngài thẻ xanh của Trung Quốc nếu điều đó có ích."" [114]. 
Elon Musk là người đề xuất ý tưởng ban đầu cho SolarCity, một công ty do hai người anh em họ của ông, Peter (COO) và Lyndon Rive (CEO), thành lập năm 2006[115][116]. Elon Musk hiện giữ chân Chủ tịch và là cổ đông lớn nhất của SolarCity, định hướng nó cùng với Tesla Motors như một phần trong chiến dịch chống lại sự ấm lên toàn cầu[117]. Sau vài năm phát triển, SolarCity, chủ yếu hoạt động ở California, đã vươn lên thành nhà cung cấp năng lượng mặt trời cho dân cư lớn nhất Hoa Kỳ từ năm 2011.[118]. SolarCity cũng bước chân vào lĩnh vực ô tô điện từ năm 2009[119], và hợp tác với Tesla Motors nhằm kết hợp giữa pin điện ô tô với pin mặt trời, cung cấp các trạm sạc miễn phí cho xe điện hiệu Tesla và phương tiện lưu trữ điện mặt trời trong những thời điểm công suất hoạt động thấp[120][121]. SolarCity cũng tham gia các chương trình từ thiện, đầu tư các dự án hợp tác với chính phủ, quân đội, và các công ty khác như Google Inc. với Google Fund[122]. Lyndon Rive kể rằng Elon Musk chỉ có rất ít thời gian cho SolarCity, chỉ liên lạc qua điện thoại vài giờ mỗi tháng và họp hội đồng quản trị, nhưng vẫn bao quát toàn bộ hoạt động của công ty.[121] 
Năm 2016, Musk đồng sáng lập Neuralink, một công ty khởi nghiệp về công nghệ thần kinh, với khoản đầu tư 100 triệu USD.[123][124] Neuralink nhằm mục đích tích hợp bộ não con người với trí tuệ nhân tạo (AI) bằng cách tạo ra các thiết bị nhúng trong não để tạo điều kiện hợp nhất con người với máy móc. Công nghệ như vậy cho phép tăng cường bộ nhớ hoặc cho phép thiết bị cấy ghép trên con người giao tiếp với phần mềm.[125][126] Công ty cũng hy vọng sẽ phát triển các thiết bị điều trị các tình trạng thần kinh như bệnh Alzheimer, chứng mất trí nhớ và chấn thương tủy sống.[127] 
Vào năm 2019, Musk công bố nghiên cứu về một thiết bị giống như máy may có thể nhúng các sợi chỉ vào não người. Musk được liệt kê như là tác giả duy nhất của bài báo khoa học đăng tháng 10 năm 2019 nêu chi tiết một số nghiên cứu của Neuralink, mặc dù việc Musk được liệt kê như vậy đã khiến các nhà nghiên cứu của nhóm Neuralink không được xếp hạng. Tại một cuộc trình diễn trực tiếp vào năm 2020, Musk đã mô tả một trong những thiết bị đầu tiên của họ là ""Fitbit trong hộp sọ của bạn"" có thể sớm chữa khỏi bệnh tê liệt, điếc, mù và các khuyết tật khác. Nhiều nhà khoa học thần kinh và ấn phẩm đã chỉ trích những tuyên bố này.[128][129][130] MIT Technology Review mô tả chúng là ""có tính suy đoán cao"" và là ""nhà hát khoa học thần kinh"".[131] Trong cuộc trình diễn, Musk đã tiết lộ một con lợn được cấy ghép thiết bị của Neuralink để theo dõi hoạt động thần kinh liên quan đến mùi. Năm 2022, Neuralink thông báo các thử nghiệm lâm sàng sẽ bắt đầu tiến hành vào cuối năm.[132] 
Neuralink đã tiến hành thử nghiệm động vật trên khỉ macaque tại Đại học California, Trung tâm nghiên cứu linh trưởng của Davis. Vào năm 2021, công ty đã phát hành một video trong đó một con Macaque chơi trò chơi điện tử Pong thông qua bộ cấy ghép Neuralink. Các cuộc thử nghiệm trên động vật của công ty, gây ra cái chết của một số con khỉ, đã dẫn đến những cáo buộc về sự tàn ác với động vật. Ủy ban Bác sĩ về Y học có Trách nhiệm đã cáo buộc rằng các thử nghiệm trên động vật của Neuralink đã vi phạm Đạo luật Phúc lợi Động vật. Các nhân viên đã phàn nàn rằng áp lực từ Musk để đẩy nhanh quá trình phát triển đã dẫn đến các thí nghiệm bị hỏng và cái chết của động vật không cần thiết.[133] Vào năm 2022, một cuộc điều tra liên bang đã được tiến hành đối với các vi phạm phúc lợi động vật có thể có của Neuralink.[134] 
Năm 2017, Musk thành lập Công ty Boring, công ty xây dựng đường hầm dưới lòng đất cho các phương tiện chuyên dụng, công suất lớn có thể di chuyển với tốc độ 150 dặm một giờ (240 km/h) và do đó vượt qua giao thông trên mặt đất ở các thành phố lớn.[135][136] Đầu năm 2017, công ty bắt đầu thảo luận với các cơ quan quản lý và bắt đầu xây dựng một ""rãnh thử nghiệm"" rộng 30 ft (9,1 m), dài 50 ft (15 m) và sâu 15 ft (4,6 m) tại cơ sở văn phòng của SpaceX, vì điều đó không cần giấy phép. Đường hầm Los Angeles, có chiều dài chưa đến 3,2 km, ra mắt các nhà báo vào năm 2018.[137] Đường hầm này được sử dụng cho Tesla Model X và được cho là khá khó khăn khi di chuyển ở tốc độ dưới mức tối ưu.[138] 
Hai dự án đường hầm được công bố vào năm 2018, ở Chicago và Tây Los Angeles, đã bị hủy bỏ.[139][140] Tuy nhiên, một đường hầm bên dưới Trung tâm Hội nghị Las Vegas đã được hoàn thành vào đầu năm 2021.[141] Các quan chức địa phương cũng đã phê duyệt việc mở rộng thêm hệ thống đường hầm.[142] Vào năm 2021, việc xây dựng đường hầm  cho Fort Lauderdale, Florida đã được phê duyệt.[143] 
Đầu năm 2017, Musk bày bắt đầu tỏ sự quan tâm đến việc mua Twitter,[144] trước đó ông đã đặt câu hỏi về cam kết của nền tảng này đối với quyền tự do ngôn luận.[145][146] Vào tháng 1 năm 2022, Musk bắt đầu mua cổ phiếu Twitter và đạt 9,2% cổ phần vào tháng 4 năm 2022,[147] khiến ông trở thành cổ đông lớn nhất của Twitter tại thời điểm đó.[148] Khi sự việc này được tiết lộ công khai, cổ phiếu Twitter đã trải qua đợt tăng giá trong ngày lớn nhất kể từ khi công ty IPO năm 2013.[149] Vào ngày 4 tháng 4 năm 2022, Musk đã đồng ý với một thỏa thuận bổ nhiệm ông vào ban giám đốc của Twitter và đồng thời cấm ông mua hơn 14,9% cổ phần của công ty.[150][151] Tuy nhiên, vào ngày 13 tháng 4, Musk đã đưa ra lời đề nghị trị giá 43 tỷ đô la để mua lại Twitter, khởi động một cuộc mua thâu tóm để mua lại 100% cổ phiếu của Twitter với giá 54,20 đô la một cổ phiếu.[152][153] Đáp lại, hội đồng quản trị của Twitter đã thông qua một kế hoạch ""viên thuốc độc"" đáp ứng quyền cổ đông để làm cho bất kỳ nhà đầu tư đơn lẻ nào sở hữu hơn 15% cổ phần của công ty mà không có sự chấp thuận của hội đồng quản trị sẽ tốn kém hơn.[154] Tuy nhiên, vào cuối tháng 4 năm 2020, Musk đã kết thúc thành công cuộc đấu thầu của mình với giá khoảng 44 tỷ đô la.[155] Số tiền này bao gồm khoản vay khoảng 12,5 tỷ đô la thế chấp bằng cổ phiếu Tesla của ông và 21 tỷ đô la tài trợ vốn cổ phần.[156][157] 
Musk từng có kế hoạch cho một dự án mang tên ""Ốc đảo Sao Hỏa"" vào năm 2001 nhằm mục đích đưa một nhà kính thu nhỏ thử nghiệm lên Sao Hỏa, mang nhiều loại rau củ để trồng trên đất sao Hỏa[158]. Dự án này bị Musk dừng lại do ông sau đó đi tới kết luận rằng vấn đề cơ bản ngăn cản con người có thể trở thành một nền văn minh sinh sống ngoài không gian thực sự là việc thiếu một tiến bộ bước ngoặt trong công nghệ tên lửa; đó chính là thời điểm ông tập trung hoàn toàn vào dự án SpaceX. 
Mục tiêu dài hạn của Musk là thông qua SpaceX đưa loài người phát triển thành một nền văn minh ngoài không gian thực thụ.[159] Cụ thể, ông định đưa được nhìn thấy trong đời mình, một thuộc địa với 80.000 người được thành lập trên Sao Hỏa. Ông hy vọng sẽ trên hành tinh đỏ, nói rằng: ""Hẳn sẽ khá thú vị để chết trên Sao Hỏa...""[77] 
Musk từng tham gia ủng hộ Ủy ban Hành động Chính trị Hoa Kỳ FWD.us, một tổ chức vận động nghị trường cho cải cách chính sách nhập cư do các doanh nhân ở Thung lũng Silicon đại diện bởi Mark Zuckerberg gây dựng. Tuy nhiên tháng 5 năm 2013, Musk công khai rút bỏ sự ủng hộ khi FWD.us đưa ra quảng cáo cho một dự án vận chuyển dầu thô đi ngược lại lý tưởng bảo vệ môi trường của ông. Cùng với một số thành viên khác như David Sacks, ông rút khỏi tổ chức và phê phán chính sách của tổ chức vận động hành lang thường ủng hộ cả hai chiều hướng chính trị cùng lúc để kiếm sự hậu thuẫn từ giới lập pháp, gọi điều đó là ""vô đạo đức""[160]: ""Bạn phải chiến đấu trên lẽ phải của mục đích, chứ không phải chơi một trò Machiavelli mà bạn đồng ý ủng hộ những thứ xấu xa để những thứ tốt đẹp được thông qua""[77]. 
Tháng 7 năm 2012, Musk thông báo về một dự án hoàn toàn mới của ông mang tên ""Hyperloop"", một hệ thống đường hầm phản lực chạy bằng năng lượng mặt trời, được ông kì vọng là sẽ cho phép di chuyển từ San Francisco đến Los Angeles trong vòng ít nhất 30 phút (nghĩa là gần đạt tới tốc độ âm thanh)[161]. Elon Musk dự trù dự án này tiêu tốn khoảng 6 tỷ đô la, tức chỉ bằng một phần 10 chi phí xây dựng đường tàu cao tốc; các chi tiết thiết kế của Hyperloop được Musk công bố vào tháng 8 năm 2013.[162] 
Năm 2015, Musk đồng sáng lập OpenAI, một công ty nghiên cứu trí tuệ nhân tạo (AI) phi lợi nhuận nhằm phát triển trí tuệ nhân tạo chung nhằm mục đích an toàn và có lợi cho nhân loại.[163] 
Năm 2018, Musk rời hội đồng quản trị OpenAI để tránh những xung đột có thể xảy ra trong tương lai với vai trò Giám đốc điều hành của Tesla khi công ty sau này ngày càng tham gia nhiều hơn vào AI thông qua Tesla Autopilot.[164] 
Những thành tựu đạt được đã đưa Elon Musk lên vị trí một trong những doanh nhân có nhiều ảnh hưởng nhất trên thế giới cũng như một biểu tượng của ngành công nghệ không gian. Ông xuất hiện trong danh sách 100 nhân vật quan trọng nhất thế giới năm 2010 của tạp chí Time[165], danh sách 75 nhân vật ảnh hưởng nhất thế kỷ XXI của tạp chí Esquire[78], danh sách 20 CEO quyền lực nhất Hoa Kỳ dưới 40 tuổi của Forbes.[166], danh hiệu Nhà cách tân của năm (2007) của tạp chí R&D Magazine[167], Doanh nhân của năm (2007) của tạp chí Inc Magazine[168], xếp vào những Huyền thoại sống hàng không năm 2010 bởi Quỹ Kitty Hawk (2010)[169], Doanh nhân ô tô của năm (2010)[170]. 
Ông cũng nhận các giải thưởng như Huy chương Vàng của Hội Hoàng gia Hàng không học Anh (2012),[171] Huy chương Vàng Không gian của Liên đoàn Hàng không Quốc tế (FAI) năm 2010 [172], Giải thưởng Heinlein cho Tiến bố trong Thương mại hóa Không gian năm 2011[173], Giải thưởng George Low của Viện Hàng không và Hàng không vũ trụ Hoa Kỳ,[174] Cúp Von Braun của Hội Không gian Quốc gia.[175] 
Ông nhận bằng tiến sĩ danh dự ngành thiết kế từ Cao đẳng Thiết kế Trung tâm[176] và bằng tiến sĩ danh dự ngành kĩ thuật hàng không từ Đại học Surrey[177]. 
Vào tháng 6 năm 2016, Business Insider đã đưa Musk vào danh sách ""10 nhà kinh doanh nhìn xa trông rộng hàng đầu tạo ra giá trị cho thế giới"" cùng với Mark Zuckerberg và Sal Khan.[178] 
Vào tháng 12 năm 2016, Musk xếp hạng thứ 21 trong danh sách Những người quyền lực nhất thế giới của Forbes [17]. 
Đạo diễn bộ phim Iron Man kể lại rằng Elon Musk chính là nhân vật đã gây cảm hứng để xây dựng nhân vật Tony Stark trong bộ phim ăn khách nói trên[165]. Bản thân Elon cũng được ví như một Iron Man ngoài đời thực và ông có tham gia một cảnh (đóng vai chính mình)[179] trong Iron Man 2 với tư cách diễn viên khách mời (cameo), trong khi nhà máy của SpaceX là một địa điểm quay phim nói trên[180]. Chiếc máy bay Dassault Falcon 900 model 1994 của ông được dùng trong bộ phim ""Thank You for Smoking"" (2005) mà ông có đóng một vai cameo là phi công[181][182] 
Musk là chủ tịch của Quỹ Musk, tuyên bố mục đích chính là cung cấp các hệ thống năng lượng mặt trời trong các khu vực thảm họa cũng như các mục tiêu khác.[183][184] Vào năm 2010, Quỹ Musk hợp tác với SolarCity để tặng một hệ thống năng lượng mặt trời 25 kW cho trung tâm ứng phó với cơn bão của Liên minh Cộng đồng South Bay ở Coden, Alabama.[185] Vào tháng 7 năm 2011, Quỹ Musk đã quyên góp 250,000 đô la Mỹ đối với một dự án năng lượng mặt trời ở Sōma, Fukushima, Nhật Bản, một thành phố đã bị tàn phá nặng nề bởi sóng thần.[186] 
Vào tháng 7 năm 2014, Musk được họa sĩ truyện tranh Matthew Inman và William Terbo, cháu của Nikola Tesla ngỏ lời về việc quyên góp 8 triệu đô la Mỹ hướng tới việc xây dựng Trung tâm khoa học Tesla tại Wardenclyffe.[187] Cuối cùng, Musk đã đồng ý quyên góp 1 triệu đô la Mỹ đối với dự án và cũng cam kết xây dựng một máy siêu tăng áp Tesla trong bãi đậu xe của bảo tàng.[188] 
Vào tháng 1 năm 2015, Musk đã quyên góp 10 triệu đô la Mỹ cho viện nghiên cứu Future of Life Institute để điều hành một chương trình nghiên cứu toàn cầu nhằm giữ trí tuệ nhân tạo có lợi cho nhân loại.[189][190][191] 
Vào tháng 10 năm 2018, trong nỗ lực giúp giải quyết Khủng hoảng nước Flint, tỷ phú Elon Musk và Quỹ Musk đã quyên góp hơn 480.000 đô la để lắp đặt các đài phun nước mới với hệ thống lọc để tiếp cận với nước sạch tại tất cả các trường thuộc Flint, Michigan.[192] Tính đến năm 2019, khoảng 30.000 trẻ em ở tất cả 12 trường trong khu vực có nước uống miễn phí, an toàn từ các hệ thống lọc nước.[193] 
Elon Musk là một nhà tài trợ hàng đầu cho ACLU.[194] 
Vào tháng 10 năm 2019, Elon Musk đã quyên góp 1 triệu đô la Mỹ cho Team Trees là một phong trào gây quỹ với mục tiêu trồng được 20 triệu cây trước năm 2020. [note 2] và phối hợp với Tổ chức Arbor Day là một tổ chức giáo dục và bảo tồn phi lợi nhuận được thành lập vào năm 1972 tại Nebraska, Hoa Kỳ bởi John Rosenow. Đây là tổ chức phi lợi nhuận lớn nhất dành riêng cho việc trồng cây.[195][196][197] 
Tosca Musk là em gái của Elon, là một nhà làm phim. Cô là người sáng lập của Musk Entertainment và đã sản xuất nhiều bộ phim khác nhau.[198] 
Musk đã gặp người vợ đầu tiên của mình, nhà văn người Canada Justine Wilson, trong khi cả hai đều là sinh viên tại Đại học Queen ở Ontario, Canada. Họ kết hôn năm 2000 và ly thân năm 2008.[199] Con trai đầu của họ, Nevada Alexander Musk, mất vì hội chứng đột tử ở trẻ sơ sinh (SIDS) khi được 10 tuần tuổi.[200] Sau đó họ có năm người con trai thông qua thụ tinh trong ống nghiệm[201]- gồm một cặp song sinh vào năm 2004 (Griffin và Xavier), tiếp theo là sinh ba năm 2006 (Kai, Saxon và Damian). Họ chia sẻ quyền nuôi cả năm người con trai.[202] 
Năm 2008, Elon Musk bắt đầu hẹn hò với nữ diễn viên người Anh Talulah Riley và kết hôn năm 2010. Tháng 1 năm 2012, Musk tuyên bố rằng ông đã chấm dứt mối quan hệ bốn năm[37][203] với Riley thông qua trang Twitter cá nhân, ""Đó là một bốn năm tuyệt vời. Tôi sẽ yêu em mãi mãi. Em sẽ làm cho ai đó rất hạnh phúc vào một ngày nào đó.""[204] 
Tháng 7 năm 2013, Elon Musk và Riley tái hợp. Tháng 12 năm 2014, Musk đệ đơn ly hôn lần thứ hai với Riley; tuy nhiên sau đó đã rút đơn.[205] Tháng 3 năm 2016, các phương tiện truyền thông tiết lộ thủ tục ly hôn một lần nữa đang được tiến hành, lần này là từ phía Riley muốn ly hôn Elon Musk.[206] Vụ ly hôn được hoàn tất vào cuối năm 2016.[207] 
Musk bắt đầu hẹn hò với nữ diễn viên người Mỹ Amber Heard vào năm 2016, họ chia tay sau một năm do lịch trình vướng mắc.[208][209] 
Vào ngày 7 tháng 5 năm 2018, Elon Musk và nữ nghệ sĩ người Canada, Grimes tiết lộ rằng họ đã bắt đầu hẹn hò.[210][211][212] 
Vào ngày 8 tháng 1 năm 2020, Grimes tuyên bố rằng cô đang mang thai đứa con đầu lòng của họ.[213][214] Con trai của Grimes và Musk chào đời vào ngày 4 tháng 5 năm 2020.[215][216] Theo Elon Musk và Grimes, tên em bé là ""X Æ A-12"" (được phát âm là ""Ex Ash A Twelve""[217] hoặc ""Ex Aye Eye""[218]), tuy nhiên tên này được coi là không hợp lệ theo luật California, bởi vì nó chứa các ký tự không có trong bảng chữ cái hiện tại bảng chữ cái tiếng Anh,[219] và sau đó được đổi thành ""X Æ A-Xii"", điều này đã gây ra sự nhầm lẫn, vì ""Æ"" vẫn chưa có trong bảng chữ cái tiếng Anh hiện đại.[220] Musk xác nhận rằng mình đã tạm chia tay bạn gái vào tháng 9 năm 2021.[221][222] 
Vào ngày 6 tháng 9 năm 2018, Musk xuất hiện trên chương trình podcast The Joe Rogan Experience cùng thảo luận về nhiều chủ đề khác nhau trong hơn hai giờ. Trong vòng năm ngày, sự có mặt của Elon đã thu hút được 10 triệu lượt xem trên kênh YouTube của chương trình này.[223] 
Một trong những hành động gây tranh cãi của chương trình là việc Elon Musk hút một điếu xì gà, Rogan xác nhận đó là cần sa được cuốn bởi giấy xì gà. Đáp lại câu hỏi của Rogan về tần suất hút cần sa, Musk trả lời: 
""Hầu như không bao giờ. Tôi biết nhiều người thích cần sa và họ thấy vậy là tốt, nhưng tôi không thấy điều đó tốt lắm cho năng suất và... nó không dành cho tôi"".  
Tờ The Washington Post nhận định: ""Trong giới truyền thông, nó đã trở thành một câu chuyện về sự bất ổn ngày càng tăng của Musk ...""[224] Giá trị cổ phiếu của Tesla đã giảm sau vụ việc, trùng hợp với xác nhận về sự ra đi của Phó chủ tịch tài chính toàn cầu Tesla Justin McAnear đầu ngày hôm đó.[225] Tạp chí Fortune tự hỏi nếu sử dụng cần sa có thể diễn ra sự phân chia hợp đồng cho SpaceX với Không quân Hoa Kỳ, mặc dù một phát ngôn viên của USAF đã nói với The Verge rằng không có cuộc điều tra nào được thực hiện và Không quân vẫn đang xử lý tình huống.[226][227] 
Trong một cuộc phỏng vấn trên 60 Minutes, Elon nói về vụ việc hút cần sa:

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)       TikTok and Instagram users can scroll with abandon. But Twitter owner Elon Musk has put new curfews on his digital town square, the latest drastic change to the social media platform that could further drive away advertisers and undermine its cultural influence as a trendsetter. Keeping up with a sports game, extreme weather conditions or a major news event is getting harder under Musk’s new rules, which cap the number of tweets you can view as part of an apparent attempt to relieve the company’s overloaded web infrastructure. “The joke on Twitter is that people are going to go outside instead, but the reality is that they’re going to go to another app,” said Jasmine Enberg, an analyst with Insider Intelligence. “By sending users elsewhere, Musk is killing the main proposition Twitter has had for advertisers — a highly engaged user base, especially around news and events.” Musk recently hired longtime NBC Universal executive Linda Yaccarino as Twitter’s CEO to try to win back advertisers annoyed by a host of changes since Musk bought the platform for $44 billion last year. But she’s been silent about the new restrictions that lock users out if they view too many tweets in a day, leaving Musk to announce and explain them. The moves are “remarkably bad for Twitter’s users and advertisers,” decimating the reach and engagement that advertisers depend on, according to a statement from Forrester analyst Mike Proulx.  
“The advertiser trust deficit that Linda Yaccarino needs to reverse just got even bigger. And it cannot be reversed based on her industry credibility alone,” Proulx said. An Associated Press inquiry on Monday about how long the limits will last triggered a crude automated reply that Twitter sends to most media queries without addressing the question.  Musk had tried on Saturday to describe how the limits work, saying accounts that don’t pay for a monthly subscription will temporarily be restricted to reading 600 posts per day, while verified accounts will be able to scroll through up to 6,000. After facing backlash, he tweeted that the thresholds would be raised to 800 posts for unverified accounts and 8,000 for verified accounts before later settling on 1,000 and 10,000 tweets, respectively. Many unverified users are “going to hit that limit fast,” said Enberg, because most Twitter users are consuming, not creating posts, and “typically scroll through an enormous number of tweets in a short period of time.” Enberg said Musk should be doing whatever he can to encourage engagement to show Twitter is still viable as it faces growing competition from upstart rivals, as well as a new Twitter-like service coming from Facebook and Instagram parent Meta. “Instead, he’s throttling it,” she said. Proulx, of Forrester, said the “real reason behind Musk’s temporary rate limits” is still unclear.  Musk over the weekend explained the new restrictions as an attempt to prevent unauthorized scraping of potentially valuable data from the social media platform. He said it was a temporary measure that was taken because “we were getting data pillaged so much that it was degrading service for normal users!” The site is now requiring people to log on to view tweets and profiles — a change in its longtime practice to allow everyone to peruse the chatter on what Musk has frequently touted as the world’s digital town square. Musk has pushed back on what he calls misuse of Twitter data to train popular artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT. They scour reams of information online to generate human-like text, photos, video and other content. The higher tweet-viewing threshold allowed on verified accounts is part of an $8-per-month subscription service that Musk rolled out earlier this year in an effort to boost Twitter revenue. It has fallen sharply since the billionaire Tesla CEO took over the company and laid off roughly three-fourths of the workforce to cut costs and stave off bankruptcy. Advertisers have since curbed their spending on Twitter, partly because of changes that have allowed more hateful or prickly content that offends a wider part of the service’s audience.

The term “cis” is short for cisgender, meaning someone whose gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth. In other words, it's ...","Elon Musk says the term 'cis' is a Twitter slur. (Photo by Britta Pedersen-Pool/Getty Images) Elon Musk has deemed the words “cis” and “cisgender” slurs on Twitter and warned that anyone who harasses others on Twitter will receive at least temporary suspension. The warning came after a Twitter user complained others had labeled him “cis .” Here’s what the word means and why it has become so polarizing. The term “cis” is short for cisgender, meaning someone whose gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth. In other words, it’s the opposite of transgender. Elon Musk was male at birth and still identifies as a man, so he is legitimately cisgender. The prefixes ‘cis’ and ‘trans’ have wide usage beyond gender. “Cis” is defined as “on this side, and “trans” means “on or to the other side,” according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. A flight from Pittsburgh to Paris is transatlantic because it crosses over to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. A flight from Chicago to Philadelphia is cisatlantic because it remains on the same side of the Atlantic Ocean. And in chemistry, molecules with atoms on opposite sides are called “trans,” and those with atoms on the same side are “cis.” Retired researcher and physician educator Dana Defosse says she coined the term cisgender in graduate school in 1994 to describe people who were not transgender. The word has grown in popularity and was added to the Oxford English Dictionary and Merriam-Webster Dictionary in the middle of the last decade. So why the Twitter pushback on the use of the widely accepted word? Some don’t like the term because “it challenges the false narrative that gender identity depends on biological sex,” Defosse wrote in response to Musk’s comments in an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle. In other words, for those who don’t believe that gender identity can differ from the sex assigned at birth, there’s no need for additional terminology. Using this argument, Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling supported Musk’s comments on “cis.” “ ‘Cis’ is ideological language, signifying belief in the unfalsifiable concept of gender identity. You have a perfect right to believe in unprovable essences that may or may not match the sexed body, but the rest of us have a right to disagree and to refuse to adopt your jargon,” she tweeted. She reasons that accepting the label “cis” involves agreeing that someone’s gender identity may not match their biological sex. It seems Rowling does not agree with this premise. Rowling and Musk’s arguments suggest that cis peoples’ gender identities are more legitimate than trans people’s. In other words, cisgender individuals are presumed to be the norm, and transgender are deemed abnormal by comparison. “I’m not ‘cis,’ I’m normal,” the argument goes. Author and activist Julia Serano labels this attitude “cissexism.” Not everyone who dislikes the term is cisgender. Some in the LGBTQ+ community have argued that the word perpetuates the notion that gender is binary. University of Southern California gender studies professor Chris Freeman told The Advocate that the term “creates, or re-creates, a gender binary, which is exactly what many scholars and activists have been fighting against for decades."" Not everyone identifies with their birth sex or the opposite sex. Those who identify as gender fluid or nonbinary are neither transgender nor cisgender. It’s unlikely that Musk labeled the term a slur because he was concerned about nonbinary individuals feeling left out. Describing Elon Musk and J.K. Rowling as cisgender is accurate. Banning the use of the term on Twitter only serves to alienate the trans community and invalidate their gender identities. "
https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-ceo-elon-musk,Tesla CEO Elon Musk: Career and Biography,20230701,"Jul 11, 2023 ... Tesla CEO Elon Musk: His career and biography · Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla. He's also cofounder other major companies, including SpaceX. · He ...","Jump to        Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. His mother, Maye Musk, is a professional dietitian and model, appearing on boxes of Special K cereal and the cover of TIME magazine. Last year, at the age of 74, she was on the cover of Sport Illustrated's swimsuit edition. Maye and Musk's father, Errol, were married for nearly a decade before they divorced. Maye said in her book that she'd wanted to end the marriage earlier, but the Divorce Act, which legalized the termination of a marriage in South Africa, was not enacted until 1979. The couple was divorced the same year the law was passed. After their parents divorced, 9-year-old Musk and his younger brother, Kimbal, decided to live with their father. It wasn't until after the move was made that his notoriously troubled relationship with his dad began to emerge. ""It was not a good idea,"" Musk said of the move in an interview with Rolling Stone. In 1983, at the age of 12, Musk sold a simple game called ""Blastar"" to a computer magazine for $500, according to a WaitButWhy report from journalist Tim Urban. Musk described it as ""a trivial game ... but better than Flappy Bird."" Musk's school days weren't easy — he was once hospitalized after being beaten by bullies. The bullies threw Musk down a set of stairs and beat him until he blacked out, as detailed in Ashlee Vance's book ""Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future."" Musk's father told Insider the incident took place after Musk made some insensitive comments to a classmate. The Tesla CEO has said he didn't always feel he was on the same wavelength as his classmates. ""Social clues were not intuitive"" Musk said during a TED conference last year. In 2021, the billionaire said during his performance on ""Saturday Night Live"" that he has Asperger's syndrome. Musk has said he spent a lot of his childhood reading and coding late into the night — and it paid off. At 17, he took a university-level aptitude test on his computer programming skills. Examiners made him retake the test because they had never seen such a high score, his mother said in a tweet.  After graduating from high school, Musk moved to Canada with his mother, Maye; his sister, Tosca, and his brother, Kimbal, and spent two years studying at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, according to the school. 
                          
                        He later finished his studies at the University of Pennsylvania, earning degrees in physics and economics. While studying at the University of Pennsylvania, Musk and a classmate rented out a 10-bedroom frat house and turned it into a nightclub. The move, which Musk undertook with Adeo Ressi, was one of his first entrepreneurial experiments, Vogue reported. After graduation, Musk traveled to Stanford University to study for his Ph.D. — but he barely started the program before leaving it. He deferred his admission after only two days in California, deciding to test his luck in the dot-com boom that was just getting underway. He never returned to finish his studies at Stanford. Musk's college girlfriend Jennifer Gwynne would later auction a set of photos of Musk from his time studying at the University of Pennsylvania. With his brother, Kimbal, Elon Musk launched Zip2. A cluster of Silicon Valley investors helped to fund the company, which provided city travel guides to newspapers like The New York Times and Chicago Tribune, per the Rolling Stone interview with Musk. While Zip2 got off the ground, Musk lived in the office and showered at a local YMCA, he said in a Stanford University video. The hard work paid off when Compaq bought Zip2 in a deal worth $341 million in cash and stock, earning Musk $22 million. 
                          
                        Musk next started X.com, an online banking company. He launched the company in 1999 using $10 million of the money he got from the Zip2 sale, Investopedia reported. About a year later, X.com merged with Confinity, a financial startup cofounded by Peter Thiel, to form PayPal. Musk was named the CEO of the newly minted PayPal — but it wouldn't last long. In October 2000, he started a huge fight among the PayPal cofounders by pushing for them to move its servers from the free Unix operating system to Microsoft Windows, according to a Forbes report. PayPal cofounder and then CTO Max Levchin pushed back — hard. While Musk was en route to Australia for a much-needed vacation, PayPal's board fired him and made Thiel the new CEO. ""That's the problem with vacations,"" Musk told Fortune years later about his ill-fated trip in late 2000. But things worked out for Musk — he made another windfall when eBay bought PayPal in late 2002. As PayPal's single biggest shareholder, he netted $165 million of the $1.5 billion price eBay paid, Money.com reported. Even before the PayPal sale, Musk was dreaming up his next move, including a wild plan to send mice or plants to Mars. In early 2002, Musk founded the company that would be known as Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, with $100 million of the money received from the PayPal sale. Musk's goal was to make spaceflight cheaper by a factor of 10. One early SpaceX vehicle was named after the song ""Puff the Magic Dragon."" The name of the spacecraft, the Dragon, was Musk's jab at skeptics who told him SpaceX would never be able to put vehicles into space, Musk later shared on Twitter. SpaceX's long-term goal is to make colonizing Mars affordable. Musk has said that SpaceX won't file for an initial public offering until what Musk calls the ""Mars Colonial Transporter"" is flying regularly. Musk had also been keeping plenty busy here on Earth, particularly with Tesla Motors. In 2004, Musk made the first of what would be $70 million of total Tesla investments, an electric car company. Tesla's founders were veteran startup executives Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Musk has said he took an active product role at the carmaker, helping develop its first car, the Tesla Roadster, the Roadster. The Roadster was built on the chassis of a Lotus Elise — a tiny British sports car that Tesla remade into an electric car with a lithium-ion battery. The all-electric Roadster debuted in 2006 when Musk was serving as Tesla's chairman.  Musk also came up with the idea for SolarCity, a solar energy company. Musk gave his cousins Peter and Lyndon Rive the working capital to get SolarCity off the ground in 2006, according to a VentureBeat report.  In 2007, Musk staged a boardroom coup at Tesla, first ousting Eberhard from his CEO seat and then from the company's board and executive suites entirely. In 2008, with the financial crisis seriously limiting his options, a Tesla bankruptcy was personally halted by Musk. He invested $40 million in Tesla and loaned the company $40 million more. Not coincidentally, he was named CEO the same year. But between SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity, Musk nearly went broke. He described 2008 as ""the worst year of my life"" in an interview with 60 Minutes. Tesla kept losing money, and SpaceX was having trouble launching its Falcon 1 rocket. By 2009, Musk was living off personal loans just to survive. Right around Christmas 2008, Musk got two pieces of good news: SpaceX had landed a $1.5 billion contract with NASA to deliver supplies into space, and Tesla finally found more outside investors. Musk's career was starting to get noticed in other circles, too, most notably in Hollywood. Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark in the ""Iron Man"" movies is at least partially based on Musk, director Jon Favreau said on the ""Recode Decode"" podcast. Musk even had a cameo in ""Iron Man 2."" In late 2015, Musk also cofounded OpenAI, a nonprofit dedicated to researching artificial intelligence and ensuring it doesn't destroy humanity. He later announced that he would step down from the board to avoid any potential conflicts of interest with Tesla, which has made strides into artificial intelligence for its self-driving car technology. The billionaire has since spoken out against the company on multiple occasions and is even attempting to launch his own competitor, which he jokingly dubbed ""Truth GPT"" after the success of OpenAI's ChatGPT. By the end of 2015, 24 SpaceX launches had been made on assignments like resupplying the International Space Station, setting some records along the way.  That year, Tesla also released its first version of Autopilot, a driver-assist feature for its EVs. Musk later went on to release an enhanced version of Autopilot called Full Self-Driving beta several years later. He has since said that Tesla FSD is the difference between being ""worth a lot of money or worth basically zero."" Though, Autopilot has generated its fair share of lawsuits, as well as investigations from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration over the years. In late 2016, Tesla bought SolarCity in a $2.6 billion deal. That same year some Tesla shareholders filed a lawsuit accusing Musk of putting pressure on Tesla's board members to buy SolarCity and bail it out. Musk later won the lawsuit in 2022. In 2016, he also started The Boring Company, which has a mission to dig a network of tunnels under and around cities for high-speed, no-traffic driving. Boring's first tunnel network for commercial use, located in Las Vegas, opened in April 2021. Musk founded another company: Neuralink, in 2017, which is trying to build devices that can be implanted inside the human brain. The billionaire has described the device as a ""Fitbit in your skull"" and has said it will allow people to perform tasks using only their mind. The company has experimented with putting the device in pigs and monkeys and won approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to begin human trials in 2023. In 2017, Musk also joined President Trump's business advisory council — a move that caused a huge public backlash. He initially defended the move but then quit after Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Musk said he tried to convince Trump not to withdraw. The Falcon Heavy, the successor to the Falcon 9 and the most powerful rocket SpaceX has built to date, completed a successful maiden launch in February 2018. The Falcon Heavy carried a unique payload: a dummy dubbed ""Starman,"" and Musk's personal cherry red Tesla Roadster, which were launched toward Martian orbit. 
                          
                        ""We really wanted to get the public here to wonder, to get excited about the possibility of something new happening in space — of the space frontier getting pushed forward,"" Musk told an audience at the 2018 South by Southwest conference. ""The goal of this was to inspire you and make you believe again, just as people believed in the Apollo era, that anything is possible."" Musk ran into some trouble in 2018 when he sent a tweet declaring he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 per share and had already secured funding. Just a few days later, the SEC sent Tesla subpoenas about the company's plans to go private and Musk's comments. By September, the SEC had formally filed a lawsuit against Musk, accusing him of making ""false and misleading statements."" Musk settled with the SEC, which resulted in both him and Tesla paying a $20 million fine and Musk stepping down as chairman of Tesla's board. Additionally, Tesla was required to appoint a committee to oversee Musk's communications. One month later, Musk won a victory in court when a jury ruled he was not guilty of defaming the British diver Vernon Unsworth, Insider previously reported. Unsworth had filed a defamation lawsuit in 2018 after Musk called him a ""pedo guy"" on Twitter. Musk's wealth has soared in recent years. The Tesla CEO became the richest man in the world in 2021 when his fortune surpassed $200 billion, passing Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' net worth. Musk said he commemorated the occasion by sending Bezos, his longtime rival, a silver medal. Musk's status as the richest man in the world was eclipsed by LVMH owner Bernard Arnault in 2023. Since, he has remained near the top of the list of wealthiest people in the world. He also won Time's Person of the Year award in 2021. In 2022, Musk started buying up shares of Twitter and later turned down an offer to join the board in favor of buying Twitter outright for $44 billion.  
Musk, who has become one of the most-followed accounts on the social media site, attempted to backtrack on his offer to buy Twitter in July.  Twitter sued Musk promptly, in order to force him to go through with the purchase.  After months of back and forth leading up to a trial in the Delaware Court of Chancery, Musk agreed to buy the company in October. The same day he took over Twitter, he ousted several key executives including then-Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal. Musk took over as ""Chief Twit"" and proceeded to cut the Twitter workforce in half in the chaotic months following the Musk acquisition. He later brought in a new CEO for Twitter in May, 2023 after the billionaire said Twitter was no longer ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy."" The billionaire has also expressed interest in launching his own AI venture. In April, Musk confirmed reports that he's planning to create an AI startup to build a ChatGPT rival. Katie Canales, Matt Weinberger, and Mary Meisenzahl contributed to an earlier version of this story.

The change, which was not evident on the website on Sunday evening, followed Musk's recent admission that advertising revenue remains nearly half of what it once was. And Twitter's cash flow has been negative as a result of that and its heavy debt load. Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester, said on Sunday that the move would further alienate Twitter's original, and once fiercely loyal, user base.

On the other hand, he is signaling it is a new day for what was once Twitter and that the company is heading in a different direction with a different user base.""

Late Sunday afternoon, Twitter's new CEO, Linda Yaccarino, tweeted: ""It’s an exceptionally rare thing – in life or in business – that you get a second chance to make another big impression. Twitter made one massive impression and changed the way we communicate. Now, X will go further, transforming the global town square."" Under Musk's tumultuous tenure since he bought Twitter in October, the company has changed its business name to X Corp, reflecting the billionaire's vision to create a ""super app"" like China's WeChat. In April, Twitter's legacy blue bird logo was temporarily replaced by Dogecoin's Shiba Inu dog, helping drive a surge in the cryptocurrency's market value. The company came under widespread criticism from users and marketing professionals when Musk announced early this month that Twitter would limit how many tweets per day various accounts can read. The daily limits helped Meta Platforms-owned (META.O) rival service Threads, which crossed 100 million sign-ups within five days of its July 5 launch.

Twitter owner Elon Musk introduced, then quickly amended, new rules to the social media platform on Saturday that set ""temporary limits"" on how many posts can be read per day. Musk initially unveiled Saturday afternoon that verified accounts are limited to reading 6,000 posts per day and unverified accounts are limited to 600 posts per day. New unverified accounts are limited to 300 posts per day, he said. Within two hours of making the announcement, Musk tweeted that rate limits will be ""increasing soon"" to 8,000 for verified, 800 for unverified and 400 for new unverified accounts. Three hours later, he tweeted that the numbers are now up to 10,000, 1,000 and 500, respectively.  The changes were made to ""address extreme levels of data scraping & system manipulation,"" Musk tweeted. Details of the changes came after many Twitter users complained about issues loading tweets Saturday morning -- including receiving error messages saying ""rate limit exceeded."" The hashtag ""TwitterDown"" was trending Saturday as users apparently encountered the new limits. The website downdetector.com showed a spike in users reporting problems accessing Twitter Saturday morning, with thousands of problems reported by the afternoon. Since acquiring Twitter in October for roughly $44 billion, Musk has made major changes to the company and its platform. In an effort to significantly slash costs, the company cut roughly 75% of its 7,500-person workforce, raising concerns about Twitter's capacity to maintain its platform.  In April, the company began phasing out legacy ""blue check marks."" Now, users who pay a monthly subscription fee and meet certain eligibility criteria can get a check mark and be considered verified. Musk announced in May that he was stepping down as CEO, after the billionaire entrepreneur pledged in December to step down as the head of Twitter as soon as he found someone ""foolish enough to take the job."" Musk was replaced by Linda Yaccarino, previously the ad sales chief at NBCUniversal. Musk, who runs Tesla and Space X, said at the time he plans to transition to a role as executive chairman and chief technology officer.

The new entity is called xAI, and employs several engineers that have worked at companies like OpenAI and Google.","Tesla boss Elon Musk has announced the formation of an artificial intelligence startup. The new company is called xAI, and includes several engineers that have worked at companies like OpenAI and Google.  Mr Musk has previously stated he believes developments in AI should be paused and that the sector needs regulation. He said the start-up was created to ""understand reality"". It is unclear how much funding the entity has, what its specific objectives are or what kind artificial intelligence the company wants to focus on. The company's website says the goal of xAI is to ""understand the true nature of the universe."" The new firm will host a Twitter Spaces chat on Friday, which may reveal further details about its aims. Elon Musk was the one of the original backers of OpenAI, which went on to create the popular large language model ChatGPT, which has - often controversially - become popular for uses such as assisting students with writing homework. However, the billionaire's relationship with the company has soured. He has criticised ChatGPT for having a liberal bias.  ""What we need is TruthGPT"", Mr Musk tweeted in February. He also disagrees with how ChatGPT has been run - and its close relationship with Microsoft.  ""It does seem weird that something can be a nonprofit, open source and somehow transform itself into a for-profit, closed source,"" Musk said in a CNBC interview.  In March Mr Musk signed an open letter calling for a pause to ""Giant AI Experiments"", which to date has around 33,000 signatures. In an interview with the BBC in April Mr Musk said he had been worrying about AI safety for over a decade. ""I think there should be a regulatory body established for overseeing AI to make sure that it does not present a danger to the public"", he said. Mr Musk has also pitted himself against AI companies due to the data they use to train chatbots - the software that learns how humans interacts by scraping masses of data from various sources to fuel its knowledge and interaction styles. The billionaire believes vast amounts of Twitter's data is scraped from the platform, and that the company should be adequately compensated. Mr Musk purchased the microblogging platform in a deal worth billions, before making sweeping changes which led to many leaving the platform in protest, including the producer of shows such as Grey's Anatomy and Bridgerton, Shonda Rhimes, as well as model Gigi Hadid and comedian and actor Stephen Fry.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI on Wednesday, vowing to develop a generative AI program that competes with established offerings like ChatGPT. The company employs some engineers who formerly worked for major companies in the field like Google and OpenAI, the xAI website said. Musk, who has previously criticized the pace and ambitions of recent developments in AI, said in a Twitter Spaces on Wednesday that he entered the industry reluctantly. ""If I could press pause on advanced AI digital super-intelligence, I would. But it doesn't seem like that is realistic,"" Musk said, adding that he expects xAI to be safer than its competitors because it will be ""maximally curious, maximally truth-seeking."" XAI, according to its website, aims to ""understand the true nature of the universe."" In April, Musk announced plans to create an AI-driven conversation tool called ""TruthGPT"" after criticizing the popular AI text bot ChatGPT for being ""politically correct.""  ""There's certainly a path to AI dystopia, which is to train AI to be deceptive,"" Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of Twitter, cautioned in an interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but left the organization in 2018, accused OpenAI of ""training AI to be woke"" in a tweet in December. ChatGPT, as well as similar programs like Google's Bard, are AI-driven programs that speak back and forth with human users on a wide range of subjects. Deploying a machine-learning algorithm, the chatbot scans text across the internet and develops a statistical model that allows it to string words together in response to a given prompt. The technology has stoked controversy over its potential to spread misinformation and hate speech, as well as efforts taken by some designers to moderate responses in order to limit such outcomes. In March, Musk signed onto an open letter with some other industry leaders raising concerns about the potential negative impact of AI and calling for a six-month pause in development of the technology.  XAI adds a new company to Musk's portfolio roughly one month after he officially stepped down as Twitter CEO. He retained a prominent role in the company as its executive chairman and chief technology officer. The AI startup will ""work closely"" with Tesla and Twitter but remain separate, according to the new company's website. Musk acknowledged that the new company remains in its infancy. ""XAI is just starting out here,"" he said, adding that he expects it ""to be a while"" before the company's offering reaches a scale on par with products from OpenAI or Google. AI, he added, poses significant questions and dangers for humanity. ""It's something that's sort of hard for us to even comprehend,"" he said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

A newly constructed X sign is seen on the roof of the headquarters of the social media platform previously known as Twitter, in San Francisco, on July 29, 2023. Elon Musk killed off the Twitter logo on July 24, 2023, replacing the world-recognized blue bird with a white X. San Francisco city authorities forced the company to take down the sign right away for permitting reasons. Elon Musk's X, the company formerly known as Twitter, is suing a nonprofit that researches hate speech on social media, accusing it of conducting ""a scare campaign to drive away advertisers."" The suit alleges that the Center for Countering Digital Hate violated Twitter's terms of service and federal law by scraping data from the social media site. It claims the group cherry picks posts from the site to make it look like Twitter is flooded with hate speech and other harmful content, in order to silence users. In its complaint filed in federal court in California, the company alleged that CCDH and its British affiliate are ""activist organizations masquerading as research agencies"" and said the group was ""advocating for censorship on the internet."" Among the research that CCDH is best known for is a 2021 study showing that 12 people were behind most of the misleading claims and lies about COVID-19 vaccines on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. ""Musk is trying to 'shoot the messenger' who highlights the toxic content on his platform rather than deal with the toxic environment he's created,"" CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed said in a statement. ""CCDH has no intention of stopping our independent research â€“ Musk will not bully us into silence."" CCDH and other outside researchers have tracked increasing levels of hate speech on the platform since Musk bought it last fall. The entrepreneur, describes himself as a free speech absolutist, has loosened rules about what can be posted and reinstated the accounts of white supremacists, far-right extremists, and Qanon conspiracy theorists. Over the weekend, he allowed Ye, the rapper and mogul formerly known as Kanye West, back after a months-long suspension for posting an image of a swastika inside a Star of David.  Twitter disputes the claim that hateful content is on the rise, saying views of such posts have declined. ""Free expression and platform safety are not at odds,"" the company wrote in a blog post on Monday. Musk frequently uses heavy-handed tactics to take aim at critics. In December he suspended several journalists who covered the company (he reinstated most of them days later, under pressure from press freedom advocates), and banned a user who posted about the movements of his private jet using publicly available information. In 2018, he hired a private investigator to dig into a British man who had criticized Musk's efforts to help rescue a boys' soccer team in Thailand. Twitter's anger with CCDH appeared to come to a head after the group published a report in June saying Twitter did not take action against 99 of 100 tweets the group reported for violating the platform's rules against hateful conduct. Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino said the findings and other research cited in a Bloomberg News story about hate speech and violent content were based on ""incorrect, misleading, and outdated metrics."" ""Despite our continued progress, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) and its backers have been actively working to assert false and misleading claims encouraging advertisers to pause investment on the platform,"" the company wrote in Monday's blog post.  The lawsuit comes as Musk's chaotic management of the company and abrupt changes in policies and features have sent many users to Twitter alternatives, including rival Meta's newly launched Threads, and as Twitter's advertising revenue has plunged. It also comes at a moment when Republican lawmakers and right-wing activists are claiming that researchers who study online disinformation are actually trying to censor contrary views.

The website Twitter.com remained live and branding on the app version of the platform did not appear to change as of early Monday.  Twitter’s world-renowned bird logo was transformed into an X, however. Early Sunday, Musk posted a short video of a flickering ""X."" Asked if the logo would change in a Twitter Spaces audio chat, he said ""yes,"" telling an unknown speaker: “We’re cutting the Twitter logo off the building with blow torches."" Early Monday, Musk tweeted an image of the X branding beamed across Twitter's headquarters. Musk tweeted Sunday that the idea of changing the logo to “X” was to “embody the imperfections in us all that make us unique.” “And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,” he wrote. By Sunday afternoon, the web address x.com was already redirecting to what was once Twitter. The domain returned to Musk in 2017 after it was relinquished under the merger that became PayPal,  The shift from bird imagery to an ""X"" is the latest sweeping change since Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion last year. Musk in April changed the name of the company from Twitter Inc. to X Corp. The social media company also recently announced it was limiting the number of daily direct messages unverified users can send in what it said is part of an effort to reduce spam. That change went into effect Friday, according to a message on the help center. If users want to increase the number of daily messages allowed, they will have to join the subscription service launched last year. The latest changes come as the social media giant continues to face competition from Meta's new app, Threads, which launched earlier this month. Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a series of posts that the rebrand is the start of a move to push the app in new directions. She is the former head of ad sales for NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News. ""X is the future state of unlimited interactivity — centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking — creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities,"" she wrote. ""Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine."" Musk has teased turning Twitter into a bigger app since he bought the platform last year, talking about an ""everything app"" similar to what WeChat has become in China. The shifts marks the end of one of the most recognizable brands of the social media boom. The blue Twitter bird had also become a known icon, and one that the company previously valued. ""Our logo is our most recognizable asset,"" the company said in a branding page that was still live as of Monday morning. ""That’s why we’re so protective of it."" The origin of the new logo is not yet known, but many online have pointed to its similarity to a Unicode character. Unicode is a standard of digital letters maintained by the nonprofit group The Unicode Consortium, which also oversees emoji.

Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News          Elon Musk disclosed on Twitter Saturday that, due to a 50% drop in advertising revenue and a “heavy debt load,” the platform still has a negative cash flow. 
   
      The billionaire owner tweeted Saturday, in response to business advice from a follower, “Need to reach positive cash flow before we have the luxury of anything else.”
   
      The tweet is in stark contrast to his tone in April, when Musk told the BBC the platform is now “roughly breaking even” and that most of its advertisers have returned. 
   
      Ad revenue has been a contentious issue and an uphill battle for the site, after hordes of advertisers fled after Musk took over. Advertisers were concerned about content moderation, mass layoffs and general uncertainty about Twitter’s future. 
   
      Linda Yaccarino, a former NBCUniversal marketing executive, recently took over the CEO position from Musk – he’s likely betting on her advertising experience to bring them back.
   
      The New York Times reported that Twitter’s US advertising revenue from the five weeks from April 1 to the first week of May was down 59% year-over-year, citing an internal presentation. (CNN has not viewed the presentation.)
   
      Just 43% of Twitter’s top 1,000 advertisers as of September, the month before Musk’s takeover, were still advertising on the platform as of April, according to data provided to CNN by market intelligence firm Sensor Tower last month.
   
      “It’s definitely been extremely difficult,” Musk said in Twitter Spaces livestream event Musk hosted with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr last month. “Basically, our revenue is cut in half because we didn’t toe the line.” He added it’s been a “huge struggle for Twitter to break even.” 
   
      And, after its rival app, Meta’s Threads, surpassed 100 million downloads less than a week after it launched, Twitter is under increased pressure. 
   
      Musk has added a variety of cost-cutting or cash-seeking measures to the site, from giving blue checkmarks with a Twitter Blue membership to putting Tweetdeck behind a paywall. 
   
      On Thursday, Twitter announced content creators would be able to get a slice of the site’s ad revenue, seemingly to encourage more creators to join the site. To be eligible, the creators must have Twitter Blue and have at least 5 million impressions on their posts in each of the last three months. 
   
      Among the creators who now get monetized off Twitter: Andrew Tate, the self-proclaimed “misogynist” online influencer, who was indicted in Romania on charges of human trafficking, rape and setting up a criminal gang. 
   
      CNN did not receive comment from Twitter.

According to the company's website, Musk and his team will share more information in a live Twitter Spaces chat on Friday. Team members behind xAI are alumni of DeepMind, OpenAI, Google Research, Microsoft Research, Twitter and Tesla, and have worked on projects including DeepMind's AlphaCode and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 chatbots. Musk seems to be positioning xAI to compete with companies like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, which are behind leading chatbots like ChatGPT, Bard and Claude. News of the startup was previously reported by the Financial Times in April, along with reports that Musk had secured thousands of GPU processors from Nvidia in order to power a potential large language model. That same month, Musk shared details of his plans for a new AI tool called ""TruthGPT"" during a taped interview on Fox News Channel, adding that he feared existing AI companies are prioritizing systems that are ""politically correct."" One of the AI startup's advisors will be Dan Hendrycks, executive director of the Center for AI Safety, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that published a letter in May signed by tech leaders claiming that ""mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war."" The letter received pushback from many academics and ethicists of the belief that too much focus on AI's growing power and its future threats distracts from real-life harms that some algorithms cause to marginalized communities right now, rather than in an unspecified future. According to Greg Yang, co-founder of xAI, the startup will delve into the ""mathematics of deep learning,"" a facet of AI, and ""develop the 'theory of everything' for large neural networks"" to take AI ""to the next level."" Musk reportedly incorporated xAI in Nevada in March. Previously, he had changed the name of Twitter to ""X Corp."" in some financial filings, but on xAI's website, the company notes its separation from X Corp., adding that it will ""work closely with X (Twitter), Tesla, and other companies to make progress towards our mission.""

      Musk made the shock announcement of his plans early Sunday. By Monday morning US time, he tweeted that X.com now points to Twitter.com. 
   
      “Interim X logo goes live later today,” he wrote, shortly before sharing a photo of Twitter’s headquarters lit up by a giant new X.

      The renaming could be seen as something of a brand overhaul “Hail Mary” for the company: Musk in recent months has repeatedly warned that Twitter, facing steep losses in ad revenue, was on the edge of bankruptcy.
   
      Increasing the pressure, earlier this month rival social media platform Threads launched from Facebook
            
                (FB) parent Meta. It surpassed 100 million user sign-ups in its first week. 
   
      Twitter had 238 million active users prior to being taken private by Musk in October 2022.
   
      One of the world’s richest men, Musk was once best known for his innovative efforts through companies SpaceX and Tesla
            
                (TSLA) to launch rockets and build electric cars. 
   
Elon Musk may want a WeChat for the world. It won't be easy to build         Now, many of the headlines he makes are for his eccentric remarks on his personal Twitter account – often sharing conspiracy theories and getting into public spats on the social media platform.
   
      Musk overhauled the site after acquiring it for $44 billion in late October, then followed with mass layoffs, disputes over millions of dollars allegedly owed in severance and Musk’s note to employees that remaining at the company would mean “working long hours at high intensity.” He wrote: “Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade.” 
   
      The upheaval prompted organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League, Free Press and GLAAD, to pressure brands to rethink advertising on Twitter.
   
      The groups pointed to the mass layoffs as a key factor in their thinking, citing fears that Musk’s cuts would make Twitter’s election-integrity policies effectively unenforceable, even if they technically remain active.
   
      Musk also began overseeing controversial policy changes which led to frequent service disruptions at Twitter and upended his own reputation in the process.
   
      In June, Musk named Linda Yaccarino, a former NBCUniversal marketing executive, CEO of the company. 
   
      She commented on the name change on Twitter Sunday afternoon: “It’s an exceptionally rare thing – in life or in business – that you get a second chance to make another big impression. Twitter made one massive impression and changed the way we communicate. Now, X will go further, transforming the global town square.”
   
      As the new venture begins, it faces challenges. Musk recently disclosed that the platform still has a negative cash flow due to a 50% drop in advertising revenue and heavy debt loads.
   
      Criticizing the exit, or pause, of such Twitter advertisers as General Mills
            
                (GIS), Macy’s
            
                (M) and some car companies that compete with Tesla, Musk has called himself a “free speech absolutist” and said he wanted to buy Twitter to bolster users’ ability to speak freely on the platform. 
   
      Musk explained his approach to free speech by saying: “Is someone you don’t like allowed to say something you don’t like? And if that is the case, then we have free speech.”
   
      He added that Twitter would “be very reluctant to delete things” and that the platform would aim to allow all legal speech. Many users have worried that could mean a rise in hate speech.
   
      Meanwhile, the initial frenzy around rival Threads appears to have come back to earth, especially as it has been plagued with spam and lacks several user-friendly features Twitter, or, now X, offers. 
   
      Adam Mosseri, who is overseeing the Threads launch for Meta, has hinted at plans to add features such as a desktop version of the app, a feed of only accounts a user follows and an edit button. 
   
      Its ability to draw advertising support is, as yet, unproven.

As Elon Musk rebrands Twitter to ""X,"" here are eight facts about Americans' use of the social media platform.","Read our research on: Israel | Internet & Technology | Family & Relationships Read our research on: Israel | Internet & Technology | Family & Relationships Twitter has seen big changes since Elon Musk purchased the company in October 2022. The social media platform has gone through a transition period marked by the exit of top executives, companywide firings and layoffs, and algorithms and policy overhauls. Most recently, Musk has rebranded the platform from Twitter to X. Through these and other changes, millions of Americans continue to use Twitter. Here are eight facts about Americans’ use of the platform, based on Pew Research Center studies. Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to show how Americans use Twitter, including since Elon Musk acquired the platform. All findings are based on Center surveys and analyses. Additional information about these studies and their methodologies are available in the links throughout this post. In early 2021, 23% of U.S. adults said they use Twitter. The share of Americans using the platform remained steady over several years and was similar to the shares using Snapchat (25%) and WhatsApp (23%). But much larger shares of U.S. adults said they used YouTube (81%), Facebook (69%) and Instagram (40%). Democrats were more likely than Republicans to use Twitter in 2021. About a third of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (32%) reported using Twitter as of early 2021, compared with 17% of Republicans and Republican leaners. In a spring 2023 survey, 60% of U.S. adults who had used Twitter in the past year said they’d taken a break from the platform in that time. The survey was fielded about five months after Musk’s purchase of Twitter. Among those who had used Twitter in the 12 months before the survey, women were more likely than men to say they’d taken a break from the platform (69% vs. 54%). And Black users (67%) were more likely than their White (60%) or Hispanic (54%) counterparts to say the same. (There were not enough Asian American Twitter users in the sample to analyze separately.) In the same 2023 survey, a quarter of current or recent Twitter users said it is unlikely they will be on the site a year later. A plurality (40%) said they were extremely or very likely to use the site in a year, and 35% said they were somewhat likely to use it. But 25% said they were not very or not at all likely to be on Twitter a year from the time of the survey. Larger shares of Democratic than Republican users said it was unlikely they will be on Twitter in a year (29% vs. 20%). Conversely, Republican Twitter users were more likely than Democratic ones to say they were likely to use the site a year from the time of the survey (45% vs. 36%). Following Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, most highly active users continued to use the platform but posted less frequently, on average, according to a Center analysis of public tweets posted between January 2022 and April 2023. The analysis defined the most active users as the top 20% by tweet volume. These users’ average number of tweets per month declined by around 25% following Musk’s purchase of the site. Despite the decline in tweet volume, eight-in-ten of the most active adult Twitter users between January and April 2022 remained among the most active users after Musk acquired the site that October. The vast majority of tweets are replies or retweets, according to an analysis of tweets posted by U.S. adult users between October 2022 and April 2023. Three-quarters of these tweets were either replies to other users (40%) or retweets (35%). The rest were original tweets (15%) or quote tweets (9%). Breaking down Twitter users by partisanship revealed differences in the types of tweets users post. Democratic Twitter users were far more likely than their Republican counterparts to post retweets, while Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to post replies. Over the past two years, Democratic and Republican Twitter users’ views of the site’s impact on American democracy have changed. Republican users have become much less likely to say the site is mostly bad for democracy (60% in 2021 vs. 21% now). In turn, the share of Republican users who say the platform is mostly good for American democracy increased from 17% in 2021 to 43% in 2023. Democratic Twitter users’ views have moved in the opposite direction. In two years, the share of Democratic users who said the site is mostly good for American democracy decreased from 47% to 24%. The increase in the share who say it is bad for democracy was more modest, rising from 28% to 35%. Partisan Twitter users have grown further apart in their views about misinformation, harassment and civility on the platform. As of March 2023, Democratic Twitter users were far more likely than Republican users to say inaccurate or misleading information is a major problem on the site (68% vs. 37%). Democratic users were also more likely than Republican ones to say harassment and abuse from other users (65% vs. 29%) and the tone and civility of discussions (50% vs. 27%) were major problems. After Musk acquired the platform, he reinstated several accounts that were banned for violating Twitter’s rules on hate speech or misinformation and disbanded the team tasked with addressing those problems. He also changed the way the site’s verification system works. Between 2021 and 2023, there were notable increases in the shares of Democratic users who said Twitter limiting the visibility of certain posts (17% in 2021 to 32% in 2023) and banning users from the platform (6% to 19%) were major problems. Meanwhile, the share of Republicans who said banning users from the platform was a major problem decreased. (The share of Republican users who said that post visibility is a major problem on the platform is statistically unchanged.)

He’s submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. Elon Musk has wanted to build X.com into a super app for a very long time. As described by Walter Isaacson, who is writing a Musk biography, when Musk launched the online bank X.com in 1999, his original concept was to turn the website into a “one-stop everything-store for all financial needs.” That company would eventually be folded into what we now know as PayPal, where Musk tried (and failed) to bring back the X name. In 2023, X.com is back, intended as a replacement for Twitter with an even grander mission. “In the months to come, we will add comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world,” Musk wrote on the social network he now owns. “The Twitter name does not make sense in that context, so we must bid adieu to the bird.” What does that mean in practice? Newly installed CEO Linda Yaccarino described a bold and vague vision for the app that’s far beyond the microblogging platform that once felt like the pulse of the internet. “X is the future state of unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities,” Yaccarino wrote. “Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.” Musk’s description of where Twitter is heading was even simpler. His goal is to “transform” the social network into X, “the everything app.” Sure, that jargon all sounds like something Kendall Roy might say on Succession. But it’s also grounded in some amount of reality; apps like Musk’s still-fictional version of X do exist. Even before he officially took over the company, Musk was talking about turning Twitter into something like WeChat, the near-ubiquitous app in China that offers a bunch of services on top of social media. Many of Twitter’s product moves under Musk’s ownership have been steps in that direction, and there are hints that more are in the works. It’s easy to take this all as a joke. The jargon. The hurried announcement. The “er” getting left on the company’s sign because it apparently didn’t have a permit for the crane to remove them. But if it’s not a joke, it could be the start of something much bigger. Or possibly just a much bigger, splashier, stranger downfall for Twitter. In May 2022, shortly after Musk had put his deal for Twitter “on hold,” he discussed his admiration for WeChat on the All-In Podcast. (One of the hosts of the podcast, David Sacks, worked with Musk at PayPal.) “For those that have used WeChat, I think that WeChat’s actually a good model,” Musk said. “If you’re in China, you kind of live on WeChat. It does everything. It’s sort of like Twitter plus PayPal plus a whole bunch of other things all rolled into one with actually a great interface. It’s really an excellent app. We don’t have anything like that outside of China.” Those features include mini-apps made by developers, opening up WeChat’s capabilities significantly. And X itself is already experimenting with letting verified organizations (which pay to be verified) post job listings. Musk has also been open about his vision for making X a place where money flows. At his first meeting with company employees after officially taking ownership of Twitter, for example, Musk said there was a “transformative opportunity in payments.”  X / Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino will be on stage at this year’s Code Conference to discuss Twitter’s transformation into X, working alongside Elon Musk, and courting advertisers to the platform. Apply to attend Code here.  “From an information standpoint, not a huge difference between, say, just sending a direct message and sending a payment,” he said. “They are basically the same thing. In principle, you can use a direct messaging stack for payments. And so that’s definitely a direction we’re going to go in, enabling people on Twitter to be able to send money anywhere in the world instantly and in real time.” Later, he described some ideas that sounded an awful lot like making Twitter a bank. X doesn’t just want to handle payments for its users; it wants to pay them for their work making content for the platform, too. Some who subscribed to the product formerly known as Twitter Blue were notified in mid-July that they would be getting a portion of Twitter’s ad revenue — an initiative Musk first announced in February. Many said they received thousands of dollars. Musk said on July 22nd that the company would soon share revenue for ads on profile pages, too, which he claims will “approximately” double payouts. Musk isn’t the only tech leader to see the potential opportunity of a super app in the US. Instagram has shopping, Meta Pay lets you send money over Messenger, TikTok is reportedly about to launch an e-commerce business, and Snapchat made a run at offering apps within its app before eventually dropping them, just to name a few examples of apps trying to expand beyond their core social media focus.  The utility of X / Twitter as a super app does make some sense. It would be handy to have one single app in the US where you could read about anything going on in the world, message your friends to hang out, get some money from the bank, book a reservation at a restaurant, and then hail a car to get back home. (I’m sure Musk would want it to be a Tesla robotaxi!) But a WeChat-style super app might not be possible for X. Regulators are keeping a much closer eye on social media and technology companies than they used to, so they might step in to prevent any one app from owning too much of your experience on the internet. And it might just be hard to get people to switch over to X for things like grocery shopping or banking because there are a lot of popular incumbents at this point. Even if the super app idea is ultimately a bit nebulous at the moment, we can already see that Musk is trying to turn Twitter into a supersize social app. What might that look like? Even if the bird iconography is going away, as far as I can tell, X.com will still be a social media platform at its heart. It seems like you’ll still be able to scroll through posts (formerly tweets, now, according to Musk, “x’s”), see conversations, look at photos and videos in your feed, and DM other users. Well, DMs won’t be quite the same, thanks to... Many of Twitter’s best features are behind the Twitter Blue subscription, including a verification checkmark, editing posts, fewer ads, higher rankings in conversations and search, longer tweets (I’ll talk more about that), longer videos (and that), and even getting a cut of the company’s ad revenue (and that). There are also some “features” that are exclusive to Blue subscribers as well, including unlimited direct messages and, at least earlier in July, the ability to read way more tweets per day than unverified users. As for the potential new name for the subscription, its X account page is currently named “Blue Subscription,” and its handle is @XBlue. While Musk told one Twitter user he would “consider” the suggestion to switch the name to X Black, it fortunately seems like he was joking when he told another that the new name would just be “Balls.” You may have noticed that some posts are absolutely huge now. That’s because, under Musk’s ownership, the company has slowly increased the character count for Blue subscribers from 4,000 to 10,000 to, now, 25,000. (Nonsubscribers are still limited to 280 characters.) Those expansive character limits might be just the start. Musk recently confirmed that the company is working on a feature that will let users share “very long, complex articles.” “You could publish a book if you want,” Musk said.  Now that Blue subscribers can upload videos that are two hours long (up from one hour as of December, which was up from 10 minutes previously), you might be able to settle in for entire movies on the social network. If you know where to look, that has been entirely possible: in one instance, I saw somebody reply to a Musk post with a full reupload of Shrek the Third. (Unsurprisingly, it was taken down.) And if you like a video so much you want to save it for later, you’re able to do that — well, if you’re a Blue subscriber.  While all of this stuff about pirated movies is very funny, Musk seems very serious about building out Twitter as a potential YouTube competitor. Spaces, the social audio room feature, has stuck around under Musk’s ownership, and I suspect it will continue to be a key part of the app. Musk himself has participated in a lot of Spaces, including a disastrous one to help launch Ron DeSantis’ presidential campaign and better ones with car CEOs to announce their switches to Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) port for electric vehicles. Spaces, to me, make more sense than other aspects of the X plan: posts can be a way to broadcast text to a huge audience, and Spaces let you broadcast audio. That’s a lot of things to pack into one app. Although WeChat is a model for that actually being successful, it’s going to be an uphill battle for X. Even if the app becomes more useful, many have lost trust in the platform for an array of reasons. Verification is now bought, not earned. Musk has supported often-offensive conservative figures like DeSantis and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. And the ads seem to have gotten much worse. Twitter is also facing some huge competition on its core turf: text-based microblogging. Meta’s new Threads service had a huge launch but is losing a bit of steam. TikTok just added text posts. Federated platforms like Bluesky and Mastodon have growing communities as well. Musk’s gamble is that users will want a super app to handle everything to do on the internet. I’m not sure that they do; my sense is that people just want a safe place to quip about things like Barbie or the Women’s World Cup. Twitter often doesn’t feel like the best place to do that right now, and I don’t think adding banking is going to change my mind.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

Musk said xAI would seek to build a system that would be safe because it was “maximally curious” about humanity rather than having moral guidelines programmed into it. “From an AI safety standpoint … a maximally curious AI, one that is trying to understand the universe, is I think going to be pro-humanity,” he said on a Spaces discussion on Twitter announcing xAI. The world’s wealthiest person was one of the signatories to a letter this year that called for a pause in building large AI models such as ChatGPT, the chatbot built by the US firm OpenAI. There are growing fears that development of AI technology will race beyond human control. Musk said a pause no longer seemed realistic and he hoped xAI would provide an alternative path. “If I could press pause on AI or really advanced AI digital superintelligence I would. It doesn’t seem like that is realistic so xAI is essentially going to build an AI … in a good way, sort of hopefully,” he said. Musk, who owns Twitter, said there was a benign scenario in which the emergence of artificial general intelligence – a system capable of human-level intelligence – led to an “age of plenty” where there was no shortage of goods and services. However, there was also the possibility of a darker future, he added. Referring to the Terminator films and their vision of a future destroyed by AI-powered robots, Musk said: “It’s actually important for us to worry about a Terminator future in order to avoid a Terminator future.” He said superintelligence – AI more intelligent and gifted than humans – could be five or six years away, which is faster than many experts’ estimates. Musk, who is also chief executive of electric car firm Tesla, said it would be a “while” before xAI reaches the level of OpenAI or Google, which has released its own chatbot called Bard and owns the world-leading UK artificial intelligence firm DeepMind. On Thursday, Google announced that Bard, which has already been launched in the US and UK, would be rolled out across rest of Europe and Brazil with new features including the option of the chatbot speaking its answers back to a user, alongside using images when prompting it. The team at xAI includes Igor Babuschkin, a former engineer at DeepMind; Tony Wu, who worked at Google; Christian Szegedy, who was also a research scientist at Google; and Greg Yang, who was previously at Microsoft. In March, Musk registered a firm named X.AI Corp, incorporated in Nevada, according to a state filing. The firm lists Musk as the sole director and Jared Birchall, the managing director of the multibillionaire’s family office, as a secretary. Dan Hendrycks, who will advise the xAI team, is director of the Center for AI Safety (Cais) and his work revolves around the risks of AI. The Cais issued a statement in May, carrying multiple signatures from AI professionals and experts, saying that dealing with the risk of extinction from artificial intelligence should be a global priority on a par with mitigating the risk of pandemics and nuclear war. Musk said in the Spaces event that he had doubts over the safety implications of programming a moral stance into generative AI tools. This week, Anthropic, a leading US AI firm, launched a chatbot that operates from a list of safety principles drawn from sources such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. “If you programme a certain reality [into an AI] you have to say what morality you are programming. Whose decision is that?” he asked, adding that once an AI is programmed with a specific moral standpoint it would be easier to prompt it into reversing it. This is known as the “Waluigi effect”, named after Luigi’s mischievous arch-rival in the Super Mario video game franchise. Musk’s new company is separate from X Corp, but will work closely with Twitter, Tesla and other companies, according to its website, and is recruiting experienced engineers and researchers in the San Francisco Bay area."

Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — Elon Musk said Sunday that he plans to change the logo of Twitter to an “X” from the famous blue bird, marking what would be the latest big change since he bought the social media platform for $44 billion last year. In a series of posts on his Twitter account starting just after 12 a.m. ET, Twitter’s owner said that he’s looking to make the change worldwide as soon as Monday. “And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,” Musk wrote on his account. The change isn’t surprising given Musk’s long history with the name “X,” says Allen Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce. The billionaire Tesla CEO tweeted last October that “buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” Musk’s rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., is commonly known as SpaceX. And in 1999, Musk founded a startup called X.com, an online financial services company now known as PayPal. “Not sure what subtle clues gave it way, but I like the letter X,” Musk tweeted Sunday. But the change on Twitter was met with sharp criticism on the social media platform. The change will be very confusing to a huge chunk of the Twitter’s audience, which has been already souring on the social platform given a slew of other major changes Musk has made, Adamson said. “They won’t get it,” he said. “It’s a fitting end to a phenomenal unwinding of an iconic brand and business.” Earlier this month, Musk put new curfews on his digital town square, a move that met with sharp criticism that it could drive away more advertisers and undermine its cultural influence as a trendsetter. READ MORE: Twitter users get locked out after Elon Musk imposes daily limits on reading tweets The higher tweet-viewing threshold is part of an $8-per-month subscription service that Musk rolled out earlier this year in an attempt to boost Twitter revenue. Revenue has dropped sharply since Musk took over the company and laid off roughly three-fourths of the workforce to slash costs and avoid bankruptcy. In May, Musk hired longtime NBC Universal executive Linda Yaccarino as Twitter’s CEO. Luring advertisers is essential for Musk and Twitter after many fled in the early months after his takeover of the social media platform, fearing damage to their brands in the enveloping chaos. Advertisers have cut back on spending partly because of changes Musk has made that has allowed for more hateful content to flourish and that has offended a wider part of the platform’s audience. Musk said in late April that advertisers had returned, but provided no specifics. Musk’s move to change Twitter’s logo to an “X” also comes as Twitter faces new competition from Meta’s new app, Threads, launched earlier this month. It has been seen as an alternative for those who have been upset with Twitter. Threads is being billed as a text-based version of Meta’s photo-sharing app Instagram that the company has said offers “a new, separate space for real-time updates and public conversations.” In the first five days of its launch, 100 million people had signed up for Threads, according to a post on Threads by Instagram head Adam Mosseri.

It’s unclear how long the limits will last, and what lifting them will depend on. Musk did not respond to a request for comment. Verified accounts will be limited to reading 10,000 posts per day while unverified accounts will have access to 1,000 per day, Musk tweeted. New unverified users who join the platform after Saturday’s announcement can access only 500 posts per day. The change came after significant backlash to initial tweet limits set by the company Saturday afternoon, allowing 6,000 tweets for verified users, 600 tweets for unverified and 300 for new profiles. The news follows the announcement by the Tesla and SpaceX CEO on Friday that tweets could not be viewed without being logged into an account. He described that change as a temporary measure to deter third parties from lifting data off the platform. In a tweet, Musk expressed dismay at what he characterized as “extreme levels of data scaping” by artificial intelligence companies. He again cited data scraping on Saturday as a reason for imposing the limit. Chatbots like ChatGPT rely on troves of data, mostly scraped from the internet. Musk’s post did not describe how the change will affect Twitter features like the audio conversation platform Spaces. However, following Musk’s post, many users began sharing screenshots of their Twitter homepages with the message “rate limit exceeded,” curbing their ability to view tweet replies or posts on their home feed. The website Downdetector indicated that user reports of Twitter malfunctions spiked at 8 a.m. Eastern on Saturday and continued throughout the day. The restrictions represent the latest drastic change by Musk, who headed up the social media company after purchasing it in October for $44 billion. After taking over, Musk restored many banned accounts, including that of former president Donald Trump, and stripped verification marks from public figures and instead offered the blue check marks to anyone willing to pay $8 a month. A year ago, Musk asked, ‘Is Twitter dying?’ He may have his answer. Advertisers have fled in droves, raising questions about how the company will make money. Amid what observers have characterized as a chaotic tenure, Musk in May appointed Linda Yaccarino, formerly NBCUniversal’s chairman of global advertising and partnerships, as Twitter’s CEO. Twitter’s changing user experience and frequent glitches have led to some users jumping to similar social media sites such as Mastodon and Bluesky. Meta has also reportedly proposed introducing its own Twitter clone. Bluesky, a platform backed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, bears a resemblance to Twitter. Bluesky said in a post on the platform Saturday afternoon that it was experiencing record high traffic after Musk’s announcement. The app, described as a decentralized social network, is currently invite-only and paused its sign-ups to respond to the spike in activity Saturday."

          New Tesla facility in Buffalo was supposed to house a huge solar-panel operation, but the project hasn’t turned out as planned.
           BUFFALO, N.Y.—New York spent nearly $1 billion over the past decade on Elon Musk’s ambitious plan for what was supposed to be the largest solar-panel factory in the Western Hemisphere, one of the largest-ever public cash outlays of its kind. ... A state comptroller’s audit found just 54 cents of economic benefit for every subsidy dollar spent on the factory, which rose on the site of an old steel mill. External auditors have written down nearly all of New York’s investment.   “It was a bad deal,” said state Sen. Sean Ryan, a Democrat who represents Buffalo. “A cautionary tale is you can’t give governors too much power to get on the phone with egotistical billionaires.” ... State Sen. Ryan last visited the site just before the Covid pandemic. He and another public official who was on the tour later said that the activity they witnessed didn’t look like full-scale manufacturing work. “We still want to wake up tomorrow and hear that Tesla is really going to invest in this factory, and we’re gonna have the jobs and the ripple economy that we were promised,” Ryan said in a recent interview. “So, everyone’s reluctant to dance on Tesla’s grave because we still want it to happen.” Click here to read the full story.

After saddling the company with a mountain of debt to complete his acquisition in October, he decided to tweet baseless conspiracy theories and ...","The social network has never seen chaos quite like this. Twitter may have just had its worst weekend ever, technically speaking. In response to a series of server emergencies, Elon Musk, the Twitter owner and self-professed free-speech “absolutist,” decided to limit how many tweets people can view, and how they can view them. This was not your average fail whale. It was the social-media equivalent of Costco implementing a 10-items-or-fewer rule, or a 24-hour diner closing at 7 p.m.—a baffling, antithetical business decision for a platform that depends on engaging users (and showing them ads) as much as possible. It costs $44 billion to buy yourself a digital town square. Breaking it, however, is free.  First, Twitter set a policy requiring that web users log in to view tweets—immediately limiting the potential audience for any given post to people who have Twitter—and later, Musk announced limits to how many tweets users can consume in a day, purportedly to counter “extreme levels of data scraping & system manipulation.” Although these measures will supposedly be reversed, as others have been during Musk’s tenure, they amount to a sledgehammering of a platform that’s been quietly wasting away for months: Twitter is now literally unusable if you don’t have an account, or if you do have an account and access it a lot. It is the clearest sign yet that Musk does not have his platform under control—that he cannot deliver a consistently functional experience for what was once one of the most vibrant and important social networks on the planet.  The extreme, even illogical nature of these interventions led to some speculation: Is Twitter’s so-called rate limit a technical mistake that’s being passed off as an executive decision? Or is it the opposite: a daring gambit of 13-dimensional chess, whereby Musk is trying to plunge the company into bankruptcy and restructuring? The situation has made conspiracy theorists out of onlookers who can’t help but wonder whether Musk’s plan has been to slowly and steadily destroy the platform all along.  Such theories are compelling, but they all share a flaw, in that they presuppose both a rational actor and a plan. You may not find either here. I’ve reported on Musk for the past five years, speaking with dozens of employees in the process to try to understand his rationales. The takeaway is clear: His motivations are frequently not what they seem, and chaos is a given. His money and power command attention and his actions have far-reaching consequences, but his behavior is rarely befitting of his station.  Of course, many of his acolytes—especially those in Silicon Valley—have tended to believe that he has everything in hand. “It’s remarkable how many people who’ve never run any kind of company think they know how to run a tech company better than someone who’s run Tesla and SpaceX,” the investor Paul Graham tweeted in November, after Musk took over the social network. “In both those companies, people die if the software doesn’t work right. Do you really think he’s not up to managing a social network?” But it has been clear since the moment we got a glimpse into his phone that Musk’s purchase of Twitter was defined by impulse: It appears to have been triggered in part by getting his feelings hurt by the company’s previous CEO. The decision was rash enough that he tried three times to back out of it.  Read: Twitter’s slow and painful end  Musk’s management style at the platform has appeared equally unstrategic. After saddling the company with a mountain of debt to complete his acquisition in October, he decided to tweet baseless conspiracy theories and alienate advertisers; days before this incident, the marketing lead in charge of managing Twitter’s brand partnerships had resigned. Musk quickly unbanned Twitter’s most egregious rule breakers; fired most of the employees, including those in charge of technical duties; and bungled the rollout of Twitter’s paid-verification system. Compared with a year earlier, Twitter’s U.S. advertising revenue for the five weeks beginning April 1 was down 59 percent.  Recently, Musk’s public-facing strategy to turn his company around has been to continue tweeting thinly veiled conspiracy theories and sex jokes, cozy up to far-right politicians, hire a CEO who was initially contractually forbidden to negotiate with some of Twitter’s brand partners, and float fighting Mark Zuckerberg in a cage match. To date, Musk’s leadership has degraded the reliability of Twitter’s service, filled the platform with bigots and spam, and alienated many of its power users. But this weekend’s disasters are different. The decision to limit people’s ability to consume content on the platform is the rapid unscheduled disassembly of the never-ending, real-time feed of information that makes Twitter Twitter.  Read: Elon Musk’s text messages explain everything  His supporters are confused and, perhaps, starting to feel the cracks of cognitive dissonance. “Surely someone who can figure out how to build spaceships can figure out how to distinguish scrapers from legit users,” Graham—the same one who supported Musk in November—tweeted on Saturday. What reasonable answer could there be for an advertising company to drastically limit the time that potentially hundreds of millions of users can spend on its website? (Maybe this one: On Saturday, outside developers appeared to discover an unfixed bug in Twitter’s web app that was flooding the network’s own servers with self-requests, to the point that the platform couldn’t function—a problem likely compounded by Twitter’s skeleton crew of engineers. When I reached out for clarification, the company auto-responded with an email containing a poop emoji.)  All the money and trolling can’t hide what’s obvious to anyone who’s been paying attention to his Twitter tenure: Elon Musk is bad at this. His incompetence should unravel his image as a visionary, one whose ambitions extend as far as colonizing Mars. This reputation as a genius, more than his billions, is Musk’s real fortune; it masks the impetuousness he demonstrates so frequently on Twitter. But Musk has spent this currency recklessly. Who in their right mind would explore space with a man who can’t keep a website running?"

He claims that he wants to “understand the true nature of the universe.” Back in March, reports surfaced that the CEO of Twitter, Tesla, and SpaceX, Elon Musk, was going to build an artificial intelligence company to fight against “woke AI.” Then, in April, The Wall Street Journal discovered its name—xAI—in a Nevada filing for incorporation. Now, it’s official. Musk has revealed xAI, along with its ambitious-yet-perplexing mission: to “understand the true nature of the universe.” After launching the company, Musk held a Twitter Spaces event on Wednesday to pontificate on his plans for the company, and his hopes to create a “maximally curious” AI. “If it tried to understand the true nature of the universe, that’s actually the best thing that I can come up with from an AI safety standpoint,” Musk said on Twitter Spaces. “I think it is going to be pro-humanity from the standpoint that humanity is just much more interesting than not-humanity.” This isn’t Elon Musk’s first time in the ring at the AI rodeo. He was an early backer of OpenAI (creator of GPT-4 and ChatGPT) in 2015, but left the company three years later over a disagreement. In general, Musk has a somewhat confusing relationship with AI. He is extremely vocal about its world-ending possibilities, and has simultaneously celebrated and denigrated OpenAI’s ChatGPT—even going so far as to tweet about the dangers of “woke AI” this past December… whatever that means. From there, it only gets weirder. Just this past March, Musk joined other experts in a call to pause AI development due to its potential risks to humanity. But creating a new AI company seems like a reversal of that opinion. One AI ethics expert, speaking with New Scientist, says that building yet another AI competitor only adds fuel to the fire. Musk also spoke about a working on a ChatGPT rival called “TruthGPT” a month later during an interview with ex-Fox News personality Tucker Carlson.  As reported by The Information months ago, joining Musk’s team is Igor Babuschkin, who previously worked at Google’s AI company, Deepmind. Additionally, Dan Hendrycks, who currently leads the Center for AI Safety, will serve as a consultant. Seeing as this nonprofit exists to “reduce societal-scale risks associated with AI,” that maybe provides some assurance that xAI won’t become a real-world Cyberdyne. Other than the company’s official name, it’s perplexing mission, and its founding team—including people who’ve contributed to a variety of AI innovations including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4—we don’t know much about xAI. The company will hold another Q&A session on Twitter Spaces on Friday.  The AI race has just enter an all-new phase—only time will tell if it’ll be a terrible one.

https://www.freepress.net/blog/elon-musk-absolutely-enemy-free-speech,Elon Musk Is Absolutely an Enemy of Free Speech | Free Press,20230701,"Jul 31, 2023 ... Musk claims he supports free speech, but the evidence shows that he attacks or tries to silence anyone who dares to hold him accountable.","We respect your privacy Thanks for signing up!  In Elon Musk’s mind he’s absolutely a free-speech absolutist. He’ll absolutely defend your right to speak out, as long as you don’t criticize him. If you do ... well ... then you’re out of luck. To no one is this more evident right now than the good people at the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). The nonprofit organization investigates the spread of hate speech across social media, and has devoted much of its recent research to Musk’s many failures since taking over Twitter last fall. In return for its work, CCDH is now on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by X Corp., the company that until recently was known as Twitter, claiming that the organization “engaged in a series of unlawful acts” when researching the platform. The lawsuit is just the latest Musk assault on free expression. “Twitter has made a series of escalating and ever-more-bizarre moves to try to silence or intimidate CCDH. Starting [with] Musk calling the organization ‘evil’ and its CEO a ‘rat,’ then by his office cold-calling the chair of the CCDH Board,” a CCDH spokesperson wrote several allies in an email. “Musk’s billionaire bully-boy tactics to try to shut down his critics couldn’t be more at odds with his purported commitment to open and transparent debate.” These attempts to silence his critics are not surprising to anyone who’s followed Musk’s erratic behavior. The magnate positions himself as a champion of free and open debate while taking extraordinary efforts to silence any honest criticism and independent research that might negatively impact Musk and his many businesses.  Musk has targeted CCDH for exposing how hate and disinformation have mushroomed on Twitter since he took over in late October. That he still considers himself a free-speech absolutist is stunning given his past efforts to silence anyone who questions his motives or criticizes his businesses. Musk’s taste for shutting down dissenting voices predates CCDH and even his takeover of Twitter. Here’s the history: As Musk began rolling out sales of Tesla in China in 2021, he and company colleagues became unnerved by a number of consumers who had taken to Chinese social media to complain about issues with the company’s malfunctioning electric cars. Rather than fix the problems, Tesla called on the Chinese government to use its censorship powers to block its critics online.  By the end of the year, the company filed defamation claims against at least two Chinese citizens who raised concerns about the safety and quality of its vehicles, according to Bloomberg. Dozens of Twitter employees were fired for expressing concern about three colleagues who Musk had fired for criticizing him the day before. A Tesla employee was fired in 2022 after he posted critical video reviews of Tesla’s autopilot system, including an instance where he had to disengage the function and take control of the car to avoid a possible crash. Other employees claimed they were fired for reporting racist harassment at several Tesla plants. When one brought his complaints to management at the company, he was fired for “not having a positive attitude,” according to The Guardian. More than his predecessors at Twitter, Elon Musk has gone out of his way to appease repressive regimes seeking to shut down the social-media accounts of their critics. X Corp. has helped India’s Modi government take offline a BBC documentary that criticizes the leadership for inciting religious-based violence against the country’s Muslim population.  Beneath the surface of Musk's free-speech jingoism is a man who is far too willing to defer to repressive regimes. “My preference is to hew close to the laws of countries in which Twitter operates,” he tweeted in 2022 in response to those who called on him to defend dissident voices worldwide. He claimed that his Twitter predecessors took the same approach. Except they didn't: Prior to Musk, Twitter frequently took a stand against governments that attempted to silence dissent, calling on these regimes to respect freedom of expression. In late 2022, Musk suspended the accounts of several high-profile journalists who covered his businesses. To justify this action, he suddenly changed the company’ policies so that he could also bar the account of a person who had been tracking the whereabouts of Musk’s private jet using publicly available information. Most of the journalists who were suspended, including reporters from CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post, were merely writing about this suspension or questioning Musk’s supposed allegiance to free speech. “Musk already has a long track record of trying to silence people he dislikes or speech that is critical of him,” Free Press’ Nora Benavidez told NPR at the time, noting that the suspension of journalists “endangers the broader public’s ability to know what is happening inside Twitter.” Just this spring, Musk began suppressing Substack links on Twitter. The newsletter company had earlier announced plans to launch a Twitter-like service called Notes, which allowed people to share short updates to a reverse-timeline feed. The move angered several journalists who were using Substack and Twitter to build large followings for their newsletters and other commentary. (Musk had previously — but temporarily — blocked Twitter users’ ability to link to Mastodon, another competitor.) “Musk’s attack on Substack is part of [a] pattern, since he bought Twitter in October, to suppress content on an essentially ad hoc basis—from enabling the Indian government to silence dissent to reinstating white nationalists and haphazardly banning journalists,” wrote The New Republic's Prem Thakker at the time. Right now CCDH is Musk’s target. Next week he’ll pick another, someone else who is brave enough to call the billionaire’s bluff, criticize his alt-right politics or highlight X Corp.’s many failures. Musk’s habit of bullying those he disagrees with emboldens his many followers to pile on and harass his critics until they go quiet. The danger is not just that anyone speaking truth to power must put up with the increased abuse, including Musk’s own attacks. Groups like CCDH are forced to play defense to a set of hollow accusations, which distracts from the necessary work of holding people like Musk and companies like X accountable to their users. The headlines are focused on CCDH; they should instead center on Musk and his attempts to turn a popular social-media platform into a weapon he can wield against his political and business foes, and anyone else who doesn’t follow his reactionary agenda. The only thing absolute about Elon is his refusal to give a fair hearing to any of his critics. And that’s absolutely not free-speech absolutism. Help Free Press hold Musk accountable: Donate today. All of Musk’s decisions have been wrong, with consequences that have undermined public discourse, imperiled democracy, and harmed people both at home and abroad. For the past three years, the Media 2070 project has worked to create the media system that’s needed to realize Black liberation. Here’s a look back. Twitter’s mishandling of the platform in the aftermath of Hamas’ attack in October and Israel’s subsequent military response marks a new low. We respect your privacy Thanks for signing up!"

Elon Musk in his dual role as CEO of Twitter and Tesla. “Mr. Musk's actions since purchasing Twitter and becoming its Chief Executive ...","“The concerns about Mr. Musk’s actions as Tesla CEO since his purchase of Twitter and the Board’s failure to address or disclose potential risks related to them raise obvious questions about Tesla’s compliance with SEC rules and regulations.” “Mr. Musk’s personal wealth … do(es) not shield him or the Tesla Board from meeting basic SEC governance and disclosure rules.” Text of Letter (PDF) Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Elizbeth Warren (D-Mass.), a member of the Senate Banking, House, and Urban Affairs Committee, sent a letter to the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, calling on the SEC to open an investigation into Tesla and the Tesla Board of Directors’ (Board) failure to manage the actions of CEO Elon Musk in his dual role as CEO of Twitter and Tesla.  “Mr. Musk’s actions since purchasing Twitter and becoming its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) – while remaining Tesla’s CEO – have raised concerns about conflicts of interest, misappropriation of corporate assets, and other negative impacts to Tesla shareholders. Despite recent and repeated calls from investors to address these actions, the Board appears to have failed to uphold its legal duty to ensure that Mr. Musk act in the best interest of Tesla. The Board also does not appear to have adequately disclosed concerns about these issues to investors, undermining shareholders’ ability to make informed voting and investing decisions and to hold their fiduciaries accountable,” wrote Senator Warren.  In December 2022, following Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter, Senator Warren sent a letter to the Chair of Tesla’s Board, expressing concerns about the corporate governance issues raised by Musk’s deal to buy Twitter and his actions after becoming CEO. She raised concerns about the possible misappropriation of Tesla resources, conflicts arising from Twitter’s reliance on advertising revenue from automobile companies, and possible violations of state and federal labor law in Mr. Musk’s appropriation of Tesla employees. Senator Warren asked the Board a series of questions to determine if it was properly addressing the corporate governance concerns raised by Musk’s dual role as Tesla and Twitter’s CEO – which to date it has not answered.  “Unlike Twitter, Tesla is a public company listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. As such, it must have an independent board of directors whose role it is to ‘act on behalf of investors to maximize shareholder value … and guard against conflicts of interest.’ But despite repeated calls to address the risks posed by Mr. Musk’s conflicting dual roles at Tesla and Twitter and his actions since acquiring Twitter, the Tesla Board has taken no apparent action to address concerns related to Mr. Musk and protect its shareholders … The Board’s apparent lack of independence, combined with its inaction and incomplete disclosures, raise questions about possible violations of securities laws and exchange rules which fall under SEC’s jurisdiction,” continued Senator Warren.  Senator Warren lays out possible violations of securities laws, including Nasdaq listing rules requiring a majority independent board; SEC disclosure requirements regarding Board independence and related party transactions; and SEC rule 10b-5 regarding statements about Tesla’s code of ethics.  “Tesla is publicly owned, and Mr. Musk and the Board have responsibilities to shareholders and the public in their management of the company. Mr. Musk’s personal wealth – and his personal relationships with Board members – do not shield him or the Tesla Board from meeting basic SEC governance and disclosure rules. The concerns about Mr. Musk’s actions as Tesla CEO since his purchase of Twitter and the Board’s failure to address or disclose potential risks related to them raise obvious questions about Tesla’s compliance with SEC rules and regulations. I am therefore asking the SEC to open an investigation into Tesla to ensure that the actions of Mr. Musk and the Tesla Board have not violated securities laws,” concluded Senator Warren.  ###"

Save X Corp., the parent company of the X social media platform once known as Twitter, on Monday sued the Center for Countering Digital Hate alleging the nonprofit group that researches online hate speech is “actively working to assert false and misleading claims encouraging advertisers to pause investment on the platform.” “Through the CCDH's scare campaign and its ongoing pressure on brands to prevent the public’s access to free expression, the CCDH is actively working to prevent public dialogue,” X said in a blog post. The $10 million lawsuit was filed in federal court in the Northern District of California. Imran Ahmed, the Center for Countering Digital Hate’s CEO, accused X owner Elon Musk of trying to “‘shoot the messenger’ who highlights the toxic content on his platform rather than deal with the toxic environment he’s created.” “Elon Musk’s latest legal threat is straight out of the authoritarian playbook – he is now showing he will stop at nothing to silence anyone who criticizes him for his own decisions and actions,” Ahmed said in a statement. The CCDH has published a series of studies that found hate speech has increased since Elon Musk purchased Twitter, which he rebranded X last week, in October 2022. The group’s research has found, for example, that the number of tweets containing slurs soared by about 200% in the early weeks after Musk took over Twitter, that anti-LGBTQ+ posts about “grooming” were up 119% in the first five months under Musk and that the platform was poised to generate $19 million in ad revenue from 10 banned accounts restored by Musk. In a July 20 letter to the CCDH, Alex Spiro, a lawyer representing X Corp., accused the nonprofit group of making “troubling and baseless claims that appear calculated to harm Twitter generally, and its digital advertising business specifically.” Spiro attacked CCDH’s research methodology, including in a June report that found Twitter failed to take action on 99 of 100 hateful tweets by Twitter Blue users that the CCDH flagged to the company. Twitter Blue is a subscription that provides more features to users. The messages, the CCDH said, were racist, homophobic, neo-Nazi or antisemitic, or they included conspiracy content. All the posts clearly violated the platform’s policies, according to the watchdog group.  One tweet said LGBTQ+ rights activists need “IRON IN THEIR DIET. Preferably from a #AFiringSquad.” Another said, “The black culture has done more damage [than] the klan ever did.” And one said, “The Jewish Mafia wants to replace us all with brown people.” In its blog post, X said the digital consumer analytics firm Brandwatch recently told the tech company that the CCDH gained access to X’s data without Brandwatch’s authorization and claimed CCDH research cited in a Bloomberg article used metrics out of context and made unsubstantiated assertions about X. The lawsuit alleges that by accessing the data, the CCDH violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Also cited are breach of contract, intentional interference with contractual relations and inducing breach of contract. 
Spiro claimed in his letter the CCDH is funded by X Corp.’s competitors, government entities and their affiliates, which the watchdog denied. The lawsuit, however, says the group is funded by “unknown organizations, individuals and potentially even foreign governments with ties to legacy media companies.” Attorney Roberta Kaplan, who represents the CCDH, wrote in a reply to Spiro on Monday that his “allegations not only have no basis in fact (your letter states none), but they represent a disturbing effort to intimidate those who have the courage to advocate against incitement, hate speech and harmful content online, to conduct research and analysis regarding the drivers of such disinformation, and to publicly release the findings of that research, even when the findings may be critical of certain platforms.” She also insisted the CCDH’s work is “political, journalistic, and research work on matters of significant public concern.” Kaplan pushed back on the claim that the CCDH is aiming to hurt X and help its competitors by noting the nonprofit also has published research critical of Instagram, Facebook and TikTok.  “Elon Musk’s actions represent a brazen attempt to silence honest criticism and independent research, in the desperate hope that he can stem the tide of negative stories and rebuild his relationship with advertisers,” Ahmed said in a statement Monday, before the lawsuit was filed. 
“This should be the last time anyone dares to claim Musk is a ‘free speech absolutist’ — he is in fact a bully who uses attack dogs to terrorize his opponents into silence,” he added. Musk said in April he had laid off about 80% of Twitter’s workforce after he bought Twitter, which included cuts to its trust and safety team handling global content moderation. 
Musk said earlier this month that the platform’s advertising revenue has been down about 50%. In November, he blamed a massive drop in ad revenue on “activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.”"

Save X Corp., the parent company of the X social media platform once known as Twitter, on Monday sued the Center for Countering Digital Hate alleging the nonprofit group that researches online hate speech is “actively working to assert false and misleading claims encouraging advertisers to pause investment on the platform.” “Through the CCDH's scare campaign and its ongoing pressure on brands to prevent the public’s access to free expression, the CCDH is actively working to prevent public dialogue,” X said in a blog post. The $10 million lawsuit was filed in federal court in the Northern District of California. Imran Ahmed, the Center for Countering Digital Hate’s CEO, accused X owner Elon Musk of trying to “‘shoot the messenger’ who highlights the toxic content on his platform rather than deal with the toxic environment he’s created.” “Elon Musk’s latest legal threat is straight out of the authoritarian playbook – he is now showing he will stop at nothing to silence anyone who criticizes him for his own decisions and actions,” Ahmed said in a statement.

CNN By Jordan Valinsky New York (CNN) — In a radical rebranding, Twitter owner Elon Musk has replaced Twitter’s iconic bird logo with X. Musk made the shock announcement of his plans early Sunday. By Monday morning US time, he tweeted that X.com now points to Twitter.com.  “Interim X logo goes live later today,” he wrote, shortly before sharing a photo of Twitter’s headquarters lit up by a giant new X. The Twitter website now features the same logo, while the familiar blue bird is gone. Previously, Musk said he was bidding “adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds.” Twitter                              (TWTR), founded in 2006, has used its vivid, globally recognized blue bird emblem for more than a decade.  The renaming could be seen as something of a brand overhaul “Hail Mary” for the company: Musk in recent months has repeatedly warned that Twitter, facing steep losses in ad revenue, was on the edge of bankruptcy. Increasing the pressure, earlier this month rival social media platform Threads launched from Facebook                              (FB) parent Meta. It surpassed 100 million user sign-ups in its first week.  Twitter had 238 million active users prior to being taken private by Musk in October 2022. Spats, mass layoffs 
One of the world’s richest men, Musk was once best known for his innovative efforts through companies SpaceX and Tesla                              (TSLA) to launch rockets and build electric cars.  Now, many of the headlines he makes are for his eccentric remarks on his personal Twitter account – often sharing conspiracy theories and getting into public spats on the social media platform. Musk overhauled the site after acquiring it for $44 billion in late October, then followed with mass layoffs, disputes over millions of dollars allegedly owed in severance and Musk’s note to employees that remaining at the company would mean “working long hours at high intensity.” He wrote: “Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade.”  The upheaval prompted organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League, Free Press and GLAAD, to pressure brands to rethink advertising on Twitter. The groups pointed to the mass layoffs as a key factor in their thinking, citing fears that Musk’s cuts would make Twitter’s election-integrity policies effectively unenforceable, even if they technically remain active. Musk also began overseeing controversial policy changes which led to frequent service disruptions at Twitter and upended his own reputation in the process. ‘A second chance’ 
In June, Musk named Linda Yaccarino, a former NBCUniversal marketing executive, CEO of the company.  She commented on the name change on Twitter Sunday afternoon: “It’s an exceptionally rare thing – in life or in business – that you get a second chance to make another big impression. Twitter made one massive impression and changed the way we communicate. Now, X will go further, transforming the global town square.” As the new venture begins, it faces challenges. Musk recently disclosed that the platform still has a negative cash flow due to a 50% drop in advertising revenue and heavy debt loads. Criticizing the exit, or pause, of such Twitter advertisers as General Mills                              (GIS), Macy’s                              (M) and some car companies that compete with Tesla, Musk has called himself a “free speech absolutist” and said he wanted to buy Twitter to bolster users’ ability to speak freely on the platform.  Musk explained his approach to free speech by saying: “Is someone you don’t like allowed to say something you don’t like? And if that is the case, then we have free speech.” He added that Twitter would “be very reluctant to delete things” and that the platform would aim to allow all legal speech. Many users have worried that could mean a rise in hate speech. Meanwhile, the initial frenzy around rival Threads appears to have come back to earth, especially as it has been plagued with spam and lacks several user-friendly features Twitter, or, now X, offers.  Adam Mosseri, who is overseeing the Threads launch for Meta, has hinted at plans to add features such as a desktop version of the app, a feed of only accounts a user follows and an edit button.  Its ability to draw advertising support is, as yet, unproven.  The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.

             Is this the answer to student credentials verification when applying for studying abroad? What challenges do you foresee?  #APAAR, which stands for Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry, is envisioned as a special ID system for all students in India, starting from childhood. Under the initiative, each student would get a lifelong APAAR ID, making it easy for the learners, schools, and governments to track academic progress from pre-primary education to higher education. APAAR would also serve as a gateway to #Digilocker, a digital system where students can store their important documents and achievements, such as exam results and report cards, digitally, making it easier to access and use them in the future for, say, pursuing higher education or finding a job. #studyabroad AdmitKard

             Don't panic. Update and clarification. Many people have been talking about the impact of India/Canada dialogue on students going for higher education. 3 things only to keep in mind: 1. This is temporary and should reopen post Christmas holidays. 2. VFS services will be operational for biometric 3. Expect some delays as people bandwidth would be limited, so Jan intake students to apply as early as possible for their visas. And yes, Delhi is open!

             There's no denying that Elon Musk is a visionary genius, leading the charge in technological advancements and revolutionising multiple industries. However, as with any maverick innovator, he sometimes dances dangerously close to the edge between genius and insanity. His high-profile acquisition of Twitter raised eyebrows and sparked debates about the potential risks associated with his bold decisions.  But let's take a step back and examine how Elon Musk's journey sheds light on the importance of seeking an outside perspective, even for the brightest minds. ✨ 🛠️ 𝗜𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗯𝗲 𝗯𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴: Elon's brilliance is unquestionable, but being deeply invested in his vision might lead him to overlook certain blind spots or potential pitfalls. Having an outside perspective can help identify risks and alternative approaches to refine strategies. ⚖️ 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗯𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲: Seeking external advice creates a system of checks and balances, ensuring accountability and responsible leadership.  💭 𝗙𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗵 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗮𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀: Collaborating with experts from different backgrounds brings diverse ideas to the table. Elon Musk could benefit from incorporating a diverse range of perspectives in his ventures.  👥 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿-𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗶𝘁𝘆: A successful business puts customers at the heart of everything. By welcoming an outsider's viewpoint, companies can better understand their customers' needs and pain points, leading to tailored solutions that boost loyalty and retention.  🚀 𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗲𝗻𝘃𝗶𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀: In fast-paced industries like technology and space exploration, having an external team can help strategise and adapt to challenges swiftly. The world of tech and innovation requires constant evolution, and the ability to pivot intelligently can make or break a company's success.  Elon Musk's story reminds us that no matter how brilliant a visionary may be, seeking an outside perspective brings benefits to businesses.

             Thinking about exporting but not sure if it is right for your organisation?  The recent #InternationalTradeWeek2023, hosted by the Department for Business and Trade, shed light on a crucial aspect that can serve as a powerful catalyst for organisational expansion. 🌍 The event brought together industry leaders, experts, and visionaries who shared invaluable insights, making a compelling case for organisations to harness their skills as a driving force for expansion. 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗸𝗲𝘆 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀: 💡 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝗚𝗿𝗼𝘄𝘁𝗵 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲 - Skills play as a growth engine in the context of international expansion. It's not merely about having a great product or service; it's about equipping the workforce with the skills necessary to adapt, innovate, and thrive in diverse cultural and economic landscapes. 💡 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗲 - The evolving landscape of the sector, emphasising the digital shift, AI adoption, and a seamless supply chain that prioritises transparency and dependability. 💡 𝗨𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗿𝗼𝘀𝘀-𝗖𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗲 - Every country is unique, and successfully navigating diverse cultural landscapes is essential for achieving sustainable growth. Taking the relationship between the UK and the US as an example, with low regulatory barriers, minimal language barriers and access to the global supply chain, it offers huge potential for UK manufacturers. While it offers great opportunities, its regulations are different from the UK, which is why understanding the cross-cultural landscape is crucial for international expansion. At gigCMO, we help businesses like yours succeed in global markets by providing strategic leadership and expert insights.

             Who are the largest trading partners of the United States, and how do these international economic relationships impact the U.S. economy and global trade dynamics? According to The Associated Press, The U.S. economy grew 5.7% in 2021, the fastest pace since 1984, bouncing back from the economic downturn created by the pandemic. But as supply chain issues reared their head and international restrictions came in and out of play, how did the country’s trade situation shape up? So, Who Does the U.S. Trade Most With? In 2021, the U.S. traded goods worth almost $4.6 trillion. Canada, Mexico, and China were the top trading partners, making up 41% of all trade, with a total of $1.9 trillion.

Elon Musk has replaced Twitter's iconic bird logo with X. Musk made the shock announcement of his plans early Sunday. By Monday morning US ...","Currently in Columbia  New York (CNN) — In a radical rebranding, Twitter owner Elon Musk has replaced Twitter’s iconic bird logo with X. Musk made the shock announcement of his plans early Sunday. By Monday morning US time, he tweeted that X.com now points to Twitter.com. “Interim X logo goes live later today,” he wrote, shortly before sharing a photo of Twitter’s headquarters lit up by a giant new X. The Twitter website now features the same logo, while the familiar blue bird is gone. Previously, Musk said he was bidding “adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds.” Twitter (TWTR), founded in 2006, has used its vivid, globally recognized blue bird emblem for more than a decade. The renaming could be seen as something of a brand overhaul “Hail Mary” for the company: Musk in recent months has repeatedly warned that Twitter, facing steep losses in ad revenue, was on the edge of bankruptcy. Increasing the pressure, earlier this month rival social media platform Threads launched from Facebook (FB) parent Meta. It surpassed 100 million user sign-ups in its first week. Twitter had 238 million active users prior to being taken private by Musk in October 2022. One of the world’s richest men, Musk was once best known for his innovative efforts through companies SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA) to launch rockets and build electric cars. Now, many of the headlines he makes are for his eccentric remarks on his personal Twitter account – often sharing conspiracy theories and getting into public spats on the social media platform. Musk overhauled the site after acquiring it for $44 billion in late October, then followed with mass layoffs, disputes over millions of dollars allegedly owed in severance and Musk’s note to employees that remaining at the company would mean “working long hours at high intensity.” He wrote: “Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade.”

The upheaval prompted organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League, Free Press and GLAAD, to pressure brands to rethink advertising on Twitter. The groups pointed to the mass layoffs as a key factor in their thinking, citing fears that Musk’s cuts would make Twitter’s election-integrity policies effectively unenforceable, even if they technically remain active. Musk also began overseeing controversial policy changes which led to frequent service disruptions at Twitter and upended his own reputation in the process. In June, Musk named Linda Yaccarino, a former NBCUniversal marketing executive, CEO of the company. She commented on the name change on Twitter Sunday afternoon: “It’s an exceptionally rare thing – in life or in business – that you get a second chance to make another big impression. Twitter made one massive impression and changed the way we communicate. Now, X will go further, transforming the global town square.” As the new venture begins, it faces challenges. Musk recently disclosed that the platform still has a negative cash flow due to a 50% drop in advertising revenue and heavy debt loads. Criticizing the exit, or pause, of such Twitter advertisers as General Mills (GIS), Macy’s (M) and some car companies that compete with Tesla, Musk has called himself a “free speech absolutist” and said he wanted to buy Twitter to bolster users’ ability to speak freely on the platform. Musk explained his approach to free speech by saying: “Is someone you don’t like allowed to say something you don’t like? And if that is the case, then we have free speech.” He added that Twitter would “be very reluctant to delete things” and that the platform would aim to allow all legal speech. Many users have worried that could mean a rise in hate speech. Meanwhile, the initial frenzy around rival Threads appears to have come back to earth, especially as it has been plagued with spam and lacks several user-friendly features Twitter, or, now X, offers. Adam Mosseri, who is overseeing the Threads launch for Meta, has hinted at plans to add features such as a desktop version of the app, a feed of only accounts a user follows and an edit button. Its ability to draw advertising support is, as yet, unproven. To report an error or typo, email news@komu.com.

By Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, has sued a group of researchers — alleging their work highlighting an increase in hate speech on the platform cost the company millions of dollars of advertising revenue. The suit, filed late Monday night in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California, accuses the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate of violating X’s terms of service by improperly collecting a vast amount of data for its analysis. The suit also alleges, without offering evidence, that the organization is funded by foreign governments and media companies who view X as competition. The legal fight between the tech company, which was acquired by Elon Musk last year, and the center could have significant implications for a growing number of researchers and advocacy groups that seek to help the public understand how social media is shaping society and culture. With offices in the U.S. and United Kingdom, the center regularly publishes reports on hate speech, extremism and harmful behavior on social media platforms like X, TikTok or Facebook. The organization has published several reports critical of Musk’s leadership, detailing an increase in anti-LGBTQ hate speech as well as climate misinformation since his purchase. In its lawsuit, X alleges the center violated its terms of service by automatically scraping large amounts of data from the site without the company’s permission. X also claims the center improperly accessed internal Twitter data, using log-on credentials it obtained from an employee at a separate company that has a business relationship with X. Without naming any individuals or companies, the suit says the center receives funding from foreign governments as well as organizations with ties to “legacy media organizations” that see X as a rival. The suit claims the center’s work has cost X tens of millions of dollars in lost ad revenue. In response to the legal action, Imran Ahmed, the center’s founder and CEO, defended its work and accused Musk of using the lawsuit to silence criticism of his leadership, as well as research into the role X plays in spreading misinformation and hate speech. “Musk is trying to ‘shoot the messenger’ who highlights the toxic content on his platform rather than deal with the toxic environment he’s created,” Ahmed said. The center’s 2021 tax forms show it took in $1.4 million in revenue. A review of major donors shows several large charities, including the National Philanthropic Trust in the U.S. and the Oak Foundation and Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust in the U.K. A spokesman for the group said the center receives no funding from any government entities or tech companies that could be considered competitors to X. The identities of other donors is not revealed in public documents, and the center declined to provide a list. Musk is a self-professed free speech absolutist who has welcomed back white supremacists and election deniers to the platform, which he renamed X last month. He initially had promised that he would allow any speech on his platform that wasn’t illegal. “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk wrote in a tweet last year. Nevertheless, the billionaire has at times proven sensitive about critical speech directed at him or his companies. Last year, he suspended the accounts of several journalists who covered his takeover of Twitter."

A staffer handed him an iPhone—in part to avoid inviting an onslaught of late-night texts and colorful emojis on Kahl’s own phone. Kahl had returned to his room, with its heavy drapery and distant view of the Eiffel Tower, after a day of meetings with officials from the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. A senior defense official told me that Kahl was surprised by whom he was about to contact: “He was, like, ‘Why am I calling Elon Musk?’ ” The reason soon became apparent. “Even though Musk is not technically a diplomat or statesman, I felt it was important to treat him as such, given the influence he had on this issue,” Kahl told me. SpaceX, Musk’s space-exploration company, had for months been providing Internet access across Ukraine, allowing the country’s forces to plan attacks and to defend themselves. But, in recent days, the forces had found their connectivity severed as they entered territory contested by Russia. More alarmingly, SpaceX had recently given the Pentagon an ultimatum: if it didn’t assume the cost of providing service in Ukraine, which the company calculated at some four hundred million dollars annually, it would cut off access. “We started to get a little panicked,” the senior defense official, one of four who described the standoff to me, recalled. Musk “could turn it off at any given moment. And that would have real operational impact for the Ukrainians.” Musk had become involved in the war in Ukraine soon after Russia invaded, in February, 2022. Along with conventional assaults, the Kremlin was conducting cyberattacks against Ukraine’s digital infrastructure. Ukrainian officials and a loose coalition of expatriates in the tech sector, brainstorming in group chats on WhatsApp and Signal, found a potential solution: SpaceX, which manufactures a line of mobile Internet terminals called Starlink. The tripod-mounted dishes, each about the size of a computer display and clad in white plastic reminiscent of the sleek design sensibility of Musk’s Tesla electric cars, connect with a network of satellites. The units have limited range, but in this situation that was an advantage: although a nationwide network of dishes was required, it would be difficult for Russia to completely dismantle Ukrainian connectivity. Of course, Musk could do so. Three people involved in bringing Starlink to Ukraine, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they worried that Musk, if upset, could withdraw his services, told me that they originally overlooked the significance of his personal control. “Nobody thought about it back then,” one of them, a Ukrainian tech executive, told me. “It was all about ‘Let’s fucking go, people are dying.’ ” In the ensuing months, fund-raising in Silicon Valley’s Ukrainian community, contracts with the U.S. Agency for International Development and with European governments, and pro-bono contributions from SpaceX facilitated the transfer of thousands of Starlink units to Ukraine. A soldier in Ukraine’s signal corps who was responsible for maintaining Starlink access on the front lines, and who asked to be identified only by his first name, Mykola, told me, “It’s the essential backbone of communication on the battlefield.” Initially, Musk showed unreserved support for the Ukrainian cause, responding encouragingly as Mykhailo Fedorov, the Ukrainian minister for digital transformation, tweeted pictures of equipment in the field. But, as the war ground on, SpaceX began to balk at the cost. “We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,” SpaceX’s director of government sales told the Pentagon in a letter, last September. (CNBC recently valued SpaceX at nearly a hundred and fifty billion dollars. Forbes estimated Musk’s personal net worth at two hundred and twenty billion dollars, making him the world’s richest man.) Musk was also growing increasingly uneasy with the fact that his technology was being used for warfare. That month, at a conference in Aspen attended by business and political figures, Musk even appeared to express support for Vladimir Putin. “He was onstage, and he said, ‘We should be negotiating. Putin wants peace—we should be negotiating peace with Putin,’ ” Reid Hoffman, who helped start PayPal with Musk, recalled. Musk seemed, he said, to have “bought what Putin was selling, hook, line, and sinker.” A week later, Musk tweeted a proposal for his own peace plan, which called for new referendums to redraw the borders of Ukraine, and granted Russia control of Crimea, the semi-autonomous peninsula recognized by most nations, including the United States, as Ukrainian territory. In later tweets, Musk portrayed as inevitable an outcome favoring Russia and attached maps highlighting eastern Ukrainian territories, some of which, he argued, “prefer Russia.” Musk also polled his Twitter followers about the plan. Millions responded, with about sixty per cent rejecting the proposal. (Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s President, tweeted his own poll, asking users whether they preferred the Elon Musk who supported Ukraine or the one who now seemed to back Russia. The former won, though Zelensky’s poll had a smaller turnout: Musk has more than twenty times as many followers.) By then, Musk’s sympathies appeared to be manifesting on the battlefield. One day, Ukrainian forces advancing into contested areas in the south found themselves suddenly unable to communicate. “We were very close to the front line,” Mykola, the signal-corps soldier, told me. “We crossed this border and the Starlink stopped working.” The consequences were immediate. “Communications became dead, units were isolated. When you’re on offense, especially for commanders, you need a constant stream of information from battalions. Commanders had to drive to the battlefield to be in radio range, risking themselves,” Mykola said. “It was chaos.” Ukrainian expats who had raised funds for the Starlink units began receiving frantic calls. The tech executive recalls a Ukrainian military official telling him, “We need Elon now.” “How now?” he replied. “Like fucking now,” the official said. “People are dying.” Another Ukrainian involved told me that he was “awoken by a dozen calls saying they’d lost connectivity and had to retreat.” The Financial Times reported that outages affected units in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Luhansk. American and Ukrainian officials told me they believed that SpaceX had cut the connectivity via geofencing, cordoning off areas of access. Link copied The senior defense official said, “We had a whole series of meetings internal to the department to try to figure out what we could do about this.” Musk’s singular role presented unfamiliar challenges, as did the government’s role as intermediary. “It wasn’t like we could hold him in breach of contract or something,” the official continued. The Pentagon would need to reach a contractual arrangement with SpaceX so that, at the very least, Musk “couldn’t wake up one morning and just decide, like, he didn’t want to do this anymore.” Kahl added, “It was kind of a way for us to lock in services across Ukraine. It could at least prevent Musk from turning off the switch altogether.” Typically, such a negotiation would be handled by the Pentagon’s acquisitions department. But Musk had become more than just a vender like Boeing, Lockheed, or other defense-industry behemoths. On the phone with Musk from Paris, Kahl was deferential. According to unclassified talking points for the call, he thanked Musk for his efforts in Ukraine, acknowledged the steep costs he’d incurred, and pleaded for even a few weeks to devise a contract. “If you cut this off, it doesn’t end the war,” Kahl recalled telling Musk. Musk wasn’t immediately convinced. “My inference was that he was getting nervous that Starlink’s involvement was increasingly seen in Russia as enabling the Ukrainian war effort, and was looking for a way to placate Russian concerns,” Kahl told me. To the dismay of Pentagon officials, Musk volunteered that he had spoken with Putin personally. Another individual told me that Musk had made the same assertion in the weeks before he tweeted his pro-Russia peace plan, and had said that his consultations with the Kremlin were regular. (Musk later denied having spoken with Putin about Ukraine.) On the phone, Musk said that he was looking at his laptop and could see “the entire war unfolding” through a map of Starlink activity. “This was, like, three minutes before he said, ‘Well, I had this great conversation with Putin,’ ” the senior defense official told me. “And we were, like, ‘Oh, dear, this is not good.’ ” Musk told Kahl that the vivid illustration of how technology he had designed for peaceful ends was being used to wage war gave him pause. After a fifteen-minute call, Musk agreed to give the Pentagon more time. He also, after public blowback and with evident annoyance, walked back his threats to cut off service. “The hell with it,” he tweeted. “Even though Starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we’ll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free.” This June, the Department of Defense announced that it had reached a deal with SpaceX. The meddling of oligarchs and other monied interests in the fate of nations is not new. During the First World War, J. P. Morgan lent vast sums to the Allied powers; afterward, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., poured money into the fledgling League of Nations. The investor George Soros’s Open Society Foundations underwrote civil-society reform in post-Soviet Europe, and the casino mogul Sheldon Adelson funded right-wing media in Israel, as part of his support of Benjamin Netanyahu. But Musk’s influence is more brazen and expansive. There is little precedent for a civilian’s becoming the arbiter of a war between nations in such a granular way, or for the degree of dependency that the U.S. now has on Musk in a variety of fields, from the future of energy and transportation to the exploration of space. SpaceX is currently the sole means by which NASA transports crew from U.S. soil into space, a situation that will persist for at least another year. The government’s plan to move the auto industry toward electric cars requires increasing access to charging stations along America’s highways. But this rests on the actions of another Musk enterprise, Tesla. The automaker has seeded so much of the country with its proprietary charging stations that the Biden Administration relaxed an early push for a universal charging standard disliked by Musk. His stations are eligible for billions of dollars in subsidies, so long as Tesla makes them compatible with the other charging standard. In the past twenty years, against a backdrop of crumbling infrastructure and declining trust in institutions, Musk has sought out business opportunities in crucial areas where, after decades of privatization, the state has receded. The government is now reliant on him, but struggles to respond to his risk-taking, brinkmanship, and caprice. Current and former officials from NASA, the Department of Defense, the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration told me that Musk’s influence had become inescapable in their work, and several of them said that they now treat him like a sort of unelected official. One Pentagon spokesman said that he was keeping Musk apprised of my inquiries about his role in Ukraine and would grant an interview with an official about the matter only with Musk’s permission. “We’ll talk to you if Elon wants us to,” he told me. In a podcast interview last year, Musk was asked whether he has more influence than the American government. He replied immediately, “In some ways.” Reid Hoffman told me that Musk’s attitude is “like Louis XIV: ‘L’état, c’est moi.’ ” Musk’s power continues to grow. His takeover of Twitter, which he has rebranded “X,” gives him a critical forum for political discourse ahead of the next Presidential election. He recently launched an artificial-intelligence company, a move that follows years of involvement in the technology. Musk has become a hyper-exposed pop-culture figure, and his sharp turns from altruistic to vainglorious, strategic to impulsive, have been the subject of innumerable articles and at least seven major books, including a forthcoming biography by Walter Isaacson. But the nature and the scope of his power are less widely understood. More than thirty of Musk’s current and former colleagues in various industries and a dozen individuals in his personal life spoke to me about their experiences with him. Sam Altman, the C.E.O. of OpenAI, with whom Musk has both worked and sparred, told me, “Elon desperately wants the world to be saved. But only if he can be the one to save it.” The terms of the Starlink deal have not been made public. Ukrainian officials say that they have not faced further service interruptions. But Musk has continued to express ambivalence about how the technology is being used, and where it can be deployed. In February, he tweeted, “We will not enable escalation of conflict that may lead to WW3.” He said, as he had told Kahl, that he was sincerely attempting to navigate the moral dilemmas of his role: “We’re trying hard to do the right thing, where the ‘right thing’ is an extremely difficult moral question.” Musk’s hesitation aligns with his pragmatic interests. A facility in Shanghai produces half of all Tesla cars, and Musk depends on the good will of officials in China, which has lent support to Russia in the conflict. Musk recently acknowledged to the Financial Times that Beijing disapproves of his decision to provide Internet service to Ukraine and has sought assurances that he would not deploy similar technology in China. In the same interview, he responded to questions about China’s efforts to assert control over Taiwan by floating another peace plan. Taiwan, he suggested, could become a jointly controlled administrative zone, an outcome that Taiwanese leaders see as ending the country’s independence. During a trip to Beijing this spring, Musk was welcomed with what Reuters summarized as “flattery and feasts.” He met with senior officials, including China’s foreign minister, and posed for the kinds of awkwardly smiling formal photos that are more typical of world leaders. National-security officials I spoke with had a range of views on the government’s balance of power with Musk. He maintains good relationships with some of them, including General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Since the two men met, several years ago, when Milley was the chief of staff of the Army, they have discussed “technology applications to warfare—artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, and autonomous machines,” Milley told me. “He has insight that helped shape my thoughts on the fundamental change in the character of war and the modernization of the U.S. military.” During the Starlink controversy, Musk called him for advice. But other officials expressed profound misgivings. “Living in the world we live in, in which Elon runs this company and it is a private business under his control, we are living off his good graces,” a Pentagon official told me. “That sucks.” One summer evening in the mid-nineteen-eighties, Musk and his friend Theo Taoushiani took Taoushiani’s father’s car for an illicit drive. Musk and Taoushiani were both in their mid-teens, and lived about a mile apart in a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa. Neither had a driver’s license, or permission from Taoushiani’s father. But they were passionate Dungeons & Dragons fans, and a new module—a fresh scenario in the game—had just been released. Taoushiani took the wheel for the twenty-minute drive to the Sandton City mall. “Elon was my co-pilot,” Taoushiani told me. “We went under the cover of darkness.” At the mall, they found that they didn’t have enough money. But Musk promised a salesperson that they would return the next day with the rest, and dropped the name of a well-known Greek restaurant owned by Taoushiani’s family. “Elon had the gift of the gab,” Taoushiani said. “He’s very persuasive, and he’s quite dogged in his determination.” The two went home with the module. Musk was born in 1971 in Pretoria, the country’s administrative capital, and he and his younger brother, Kimbal, and his younger sister, Tosca, grew up under apartheid. Musk’s mother, Maye, a Canadian model and dietitian, and his father, Errol, an engineer, divorced when he was young, and the children initially stayed with Maye. She has said that Errol was physically abusive toward her. “He would hit me when the kids were around,” she wrote in her memoir. “I remember that Tosca and Kimbal, who were two and four, respectively, would cry in the corner, and Elon, who was five, would hit him on the backs of his knees to try to stop him.” By the mid-eighties, Musk had moved in with his father—a decision that he has said was motivated by concern for his father’s loneliness, and which he came to regret. Musk, usually impassive in interviews, cried openly when he told Rolling Stone about the years that followed, in which, he said, his father psychologically tortured him, in ways that he declined to specify. “You have no idea about how bad,” he said. “Almost every crime you can possibly think of, he has done. Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done.” Taoushiani recalled witnessing Errol “chastise Elon a lot. Maybe belittle him.” (Errol Musk has denied allegations that he was abusive to Maye or to his children.) Musk has also said that he was violently bullied at school. Though he is now six feet one, with a broad-shouldered build, he was “much, much smaller back in school,” Taoushiani told me. “He wasn’t very social.” Link copied Musk has said that he has Asperger’s syndrome, a form of what is now known as autism-spectrum disorder, which is characterized by difficulty with social interactions. As a child, he would sometimes fall into trancelike states of deep thought, during which he was so unresponsive that his mother eventually took him to a doctor to check his hearing. Musk’s quiet side persists—in my own interactions with him, I have found him to be thoughtful and measured. (Musk declined to answer questions for this story.) He can also be, as he joked during a stilted “Saturday Night Live” monologue, “pretty good at running human, in emulation mode.” Musk escaped into science fiction and video games. “One of the reasons I got into technology, maybe the reason, was video games,” he said at a gaming-industry convention several years ago. In his early teens, Musk coded an eight-bit shooter game in the style of Space Invaders called Blastar, whose title screen, in a novelistic flourish, credits him as “E. R. Musk.” The premise was basic: “MISSION: DESTROY ALIEN FREIGHTER CARRYING DEADLY HYDROGEN BOMBS AND STATUS BEAM MACHINES.” But it won recognition from a South African trade magazine, which published the game’s hundred and sixty-seven lines of code and paid Musk a small sum. Musk often talks about his science-fiction influences. Some have manifested in straightforward ways: he has connected his love of Isaac Asimov’s “Foundation” novels, whose characters grapple with a mathematically precise prediction of their civilization’s collapse, to his obsession with insuring human survival beyond Earth. But some of Musk’s touchstones present ironies. He has said that his hero is Douglas Adams, the writer who skewered both the hyper-rich and the progress-at-any-cost ethos that Musk has come to embody. In the “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” novels and radio plays, the latter of which were broadcast in South Africa during Musk’s childhood, a narcissistic playboy becomes the president of the galaxy, and Earth is demolished to make way for a space transit route. Musk is also an avowed fan of Deus Ex, a role-playing first-person-shooter video game that he has brought up when discussing his company Neuralink, which aspires to invent ability-enhancing body modifications like those featured in the game. During the pandemic, Musk seemed to embrace Covid denialism, and for a while he changed his Twitter profile picture to an image of the protagonist of the game, which turns on a manufactured plague designed to control the masses. But Deus Ex, like “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” is a fundamentally anti-capitalist text, in which the plague is the culmination of unrestrained corporate power, and the villain is the world’s richest man, a media-darling tech entrepreneur with global aspirations and political leaders under his control. In 1999, Musk stood outside his Bay Area home to accept the delivery of a million-dollar McLaren F1 sports car. He was in his late twenties, and wearing an oversized brown blazer. “Some could interpret purchasing this car as behavior characteristic of an imperialist brat,” he told a CNN news crew. Then he beamed, saying that there were only about sixty such cars in the world. “My values may have changed,” he added, “but I’m not consciously aware of my values having changed.” Musk’s fiancée, a Canadian writer named Justine Wilson, seemed more aware. “It’s a million-dollar car. It’s decadent,” she said. “My fear is that we become spoiled brats. That we lose a sense of appreciation and perspective.” The McLaren, she observed, was “the perfect car for Silicon Valley.” Musk had moved to Canada when he was in his late teens, and met Wilson when they both attended Queen’s University, in Ontario. He later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, graduating with degrees in economics and physics. In 1995, the early days of the World Wide Web, he and Kimbal founded a company that came to be called Zip2, an online city directory that they sold to newspapers. Musk has often described the company’s humble origins, saying that he and his brother lived and worked in a small studio apartment, showering at a nearby Y.M.C.A. and eating at Jack in the Box. (Errol at one point gave his sons twenty-eight thousand dollars. Musk, who has a tendency to fuss over questions of credit, has stated that his father’s contribution came “much later,” in a round of funding that “would’ve happened anyway.”) At Zip2, Musk developed what he describes as his “hard-core” work style; even after he had his own apartment, he often slept on a beanbag at the office. But, in the end, the company’s investors stripped him of his leadership role and installed a more experienced chief executive. Musk believed that the startup should have been targeting not just newspapers but consumers. Investors pursued a more modest vision instead. In 1999, Zip2 was sold to Compaq for three hundred and seven million dollars, earning Musk more than twenty million dollars. Justine and Musk married the following year. After their first child died at ten weeks, from sudden infant death syndrome, the couple dealt with the tragedy in very different ways. Justine, by her account, grieved openly; Musk later told one of his biographers, Ashlee Vance, that “wallowing in sadness does no good for anyone around you.” After pursuing I.V.F. treatment, the couple had twins, then triplets. (Musk now has at least nine children with three different women, and has said that he is doing his part to address one of his pet issues, the risk of population collapse; demographers are skeptical about the matter.) Justine wrote in an essay for Marie Claire that their relationship eventually buckled under the weight of Musk’s obsession with work and his controlling tendencies, which began with him insisting, as they danced at their wedding, “I am the alpha in this relationship.” A messy divorce ensued, leading to a legal dispute over their postnuptial financial agreement, which was settled years later. “He had grown up in the male-dominated culture of South Africa,” Justine wrote. “The will to compete and dominate that made him so successful in business did not magically shut off when he came home.” (Musk wrote a response to Justine’s account in Business Insider, discussing the financial dispute, but he did not address Justine’s characterizations of his behavior.) After Musk left Zip2, he poured some twelve million dollars, a majority of his wealth, into another startup, an online bank called X.com. It was the first instance of his obsession with the letter “X,” which has now appeared in the names of his companies, his products, and his son with the artist Grimes: X Æ A-12. The bank also marked the beginning of a long and so far unfulfilled quest—recently revived in his effort to reinvent Twitter—to create an “everything app,” incorporating a payment system. In 2000, X.com merged with a competing online-payments startup, Confinity, co-founded by the entrepreneur Peter Thiel. In events that have since become Silicon Valley lore, Musk and Thiel battled for control of the company. Various accounts apportion blame differently. Hoffman told me, citing the story as an example of Musk’s disingenuousness, that Musk had pushed for the merger by highlighting the leadership of his company’s seasoned executive, only to force out the executive and place himself in the top role. “A merger like this, you’re doing a marriage,” Hoffman said. “And it’s, like, ‘I was lying to you intensely while we were dating. Now that we’re married, let me tell you about the herpes.’ ” People who have worked with Musk often describe him as controlling. One said, “In the areas he wants to compete in, he has a very hard time sharing the spotlight, or not being the center of attention.” In the fall of 2000, another coup, executed while Musk was on a long-delayed honeymoon with Justine, overthrew Musk and installed Thiel as the company’s head. Two years later, eBay acquired the company, by then called PayPal, for $1.5 billion, making Musk, who remained the largest shareholder, fabulously wealthy. Perhaps the most revealing moment in the PayPal saga happened at its outset. In March, 2000, as the merger was under way, Musk was driving his new McLaren, with Thiel in the passenger seat. The two were on Sand Hill Road, an artery that cuts through Silicon Valley. Thiel asked Musk, “So what can this do?” Musk replied, “Watch this,” then floored the gas pedal, hit an embankment, and sent the car airborne and spinning before it slammed back onto the pavement, blowing out its suspension and its windows. “This isn’t insured,” Musk told Thiel. Musk’s critics have used the story to illustrate his reckless showboating, but it also underscores how often Musk has been rewarded for that behavior: he repaired the McLaren, drove it for several more years, then reportedly sold it at a profit. Musk delights in telling the story, lingering on the risk to his life. In one interview, asked whether there were parallels with his approach to building companies, Musk said, “I hope not.” Appearing to consider the idea, he added, “Watch this. Yeah, that could be awkward with a rocket launch.” Of all Musk’s enterprises, SpaceX may be the one that most fundamentally reflects his appetite for risk. Staff at SpaceX’s Starship facility, in Boca Chica, Texas, spent December of 2020 preparing for the launch of a rocket known as SN8, then the newest prototype in the company’s Starship program, which it hopes will eventually transport humans to orbit, to the moon, and, in the mission Musk speaks about with the most passion, to Mars. The F.A.A. had approved an initial launch date for the rocket. But an engine issue forced SpaceX to delay by a day. By then, the weather had shifted. On the new day, the F.A.A. told SpaceX that, according to its model of the wind’s speed and direction, if the rocket exploded it could create a blast wave that risked damaging the windows of nearby houses. A series of tense meetings followed, with SpaceX presenting its own modelling to establish that the launch was safe, and the F.A.A. refusing to grant permission. Wayne Monteith, then the head of the agency’s space division, was leaving an event at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station when he received a frustrated call from Musk. “Look, you cannot launch,” Monteith told him. “You’re not cleared to launch.” Musk acknowledged the order. Musk was on site in Boca Chica when SpaceX launched anyway. The rocket achieved liftoff and successfully performed several maneuvers intended to rehearse those of an eventual manned Starship. But, on landing, the SN8 came in too fast, and exploded on impact. (No windows were damaged.) The next day, Musk visited the crash site. In a picture taken that day, Musk stands next to the twisted steel of the rocket, dressed in a black T-shirt and jeans, looking determined, his arms crossed and his eyes narrowed. His tweets about the explosion were celebratory, not apologetic. “He has a long history of launching and blowing up rockets. And then he puts out videos of all the rockets that he’s blown up. And like half of America thinks it’s really cool,” the former NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine told me. “He has a different set of rules.” Hans Koenigsmann, then SpaceX’s vice-president for flight reliability, started working on a customary report to the F.A.A. about the launch. Koenigsmann told me that he felt pressure to minimize focus on the launch process and Musk’s role in it. “I sensed that he wanted it taken out,” Koenigsmann said. “I disagreed, and in the end we wound up with a very different version from what was originally intended.” Eventually, Koenigsmann was told not to write a report at all, and a letter was sent to the F.A.A. instead. The agency, meanwhile, opened its own investigation. Monteith told me that he agreed with Musk that the F.A.A. had been conservative about a situation that presented little statistical risk of casualties, but he was nevertheless troubled. “We had safety folks who were very upset about it,” Monteith recalled. In a series of letters to SpaceX, Monteith accused the company of relying on data “hastily developed to meet a launch window,” launching “based on ‘impressions’ and ‘assumptions,’ ” and exhibiting “a concerning lack of operational control and process discipline that is inconsistent with a strong safety culture.” In its responses, SpaceX proposed various safety reforms, but also pushed back, complaining that the F.A.A.’s weather model was unreliable and suggesting that the agency had been resistant to discussions about improving it. (SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment.) The following March, Steve Dickson, then the F.A.A.’s administrator, called Musk. The two men spoke for thirty minutes. Like Kahl, Dickson was deferential, thanking Musk for his role in transforming the commercial space sector and acknowledging that SpaceX was taking steps to make its launches less risky. But Dickson, an F.A.A. spokesperson said in a statement, “made it clear that the FAA expects SpaceX to develop and foster a robust safety culture that stresses adherence to FAA rules.” Dickson had navigated such conversations before, including with Boeing after two 737 max aircraft crashed. But this situation presented a thornier challenge. “It’s not every day that the F.A.A. administrator releases a statement about a phone call that they have with the C.E.O. or the head of an aerospace company,” an official at the agency told me. “That kind of gets into the soft pressure, public pressure that you don’t do unless you are trying to change the incentive structure.” The F.A.A. issued no fine, though it grounded SpaceX for two months. “I didn’t see that a fine would make any difference,” Monteith told me. “He could pull that out of his pocket. However, not allowing launches, that would get the attention of a company that prides itself on being able to iterate and go fast.” Musk has continued to complain about the agency. After it postponed another launch, he tweeted, “The FAA space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure.” He added, “Under those rules, humanity will never get to Mars.” Link copied Musk has been fixated on space since his childhood. The idea for SpaceX came about after his exile from PayPal. “I went to the NASA website so I could see the schedule of when we’re supposed to go” to Mars, Musk told Wired, in 2012. “At first I thought, jeez, maybe I’m just looking in the wrong place! Why was there no plan, no schedule? There was nothing.” In 2001, he connected with space-exploration enthusiasts, and even travelled to Russia in an unsuccessful bid to buy missiles to use as rockets. The next year, he moved to Los Angeles, closer to California’s aerospace industry, and ultimately he pulled together a team of engineers and entrepreneurs and founded SpaceX, to make his own rockets. Private rocket launches date back to the eighties, but no one had attempted anything on the scale that Musk envisioned, and it proved to be more difficult and expensive than he had anticipated. Musk has said that, by 2008, the company was nearly bankrupt, and that, after putting much of his wealth into SpaceX and Tesla, he wasn’t far behind. “That was definitely the worst year of my life,” he said in an interview on “60 Minutes.” SpaceX’s first three launches had failed, and there was no budget for another. “I had no more money left,” Musk told Bridenstine, the NASA administrator, years later. “We managed to put together enough spare parts to do a fourth launch.” Had that failed, he added, “SpaceX would have died.” The launch was successful, and NASA soon awarded SpaceX a $1.6-billion contract to resupply the International Space Station. In 2020, the company flew its first manned mission there—ending nearly a decade of American reliance on Russian craft for the task. SpaceX now launches more satellites than any other private company, with four thousand five hundred and nineteen in orbit as of July, occupying many of Earth’s orbital routes. “Once the carrying capacity of an orbit is maxed out, you’ve basically blocked everyone from trying to compete in that market,” Bridenstine told me. There are competitors in the field, including Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin and Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, but none yet rival SpaceX. The new space race has the potential to shape the global balance of power. Satellites enable the navigation of drones and missiles and generate imagery used for intelligence, and they are mostly under the control of private companies. “The U.S. government is in massive catch-up to build a more resilient space architecture,” Kahl, the former Pentagon Under-Secretary, told me. “And that only works if you can leverage the explosion of commercial space.” Several officials told me that they were alarmed by NASA’s reliance on SpaceX for essential services. “There is only one thing worse than a government monopoly. And that is a private monopoly that the government is dependent on,” Bridenstine said. “I do worry that we have put all of our eggs into one basket, and it’s the SpaceX basket.” Even Musk’s critics concede that his tendency to push against constraints has helped catalyze SpaceX’s success. A number of officials suggested to me that, despite the tensions related to the company, it has made government bureaucracies nimbler. “When SpaceX and NASA work together, we work closer to optimal speed,” Kenneth Bowersox, NASA’s associate administrator for space operations, told me. Still, some figures in the aerospace world, even ones who think that Musk’s rockets are basically safe, fear that concentrating so much power in private companies, with so few restraints, invites tragedy. “At some point, with new competitors emerging, progress will be thwarted when there’s an accident, and people won’t be confident in the capabilities commercial companies have,” Bridenstine said. “I mean, we just saw this submersible going down to visit the Titanic implode. I think we have to think about the non-regulatory environment as sometimes hurting the industry more than the regulatory environment.” In early 2022, Steven Cliff, then the deputy administrator of the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, learned that potentially tens of thousands of Tesla vehicles had a feature that he found concerning. For years, Tesla has been working to create a totally self-driving car, a long-standing ambition of Musk’s. Now Cliff was told that a version of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software, an experimental feature that lets the cars navigate with little intervention from a driver, permitted cars to roll through stop signs, at up to about six miles an hour. This was clearly illegal. Cliff’s enforcement team contacted Tesla, and, in several meetings, a surprising conversation about safety and artificial intelligence played out. Representatives for Tesla seemed confused. Their response, as Cliff recalled, was “That’s what humans do all the time. Show us the data, why it’s unsafe.” N.H.T.S.A. officials told Tesla that, regardless of human compliance, “you should not be able to program a computer to break the law for you.” They demanded that Tesla update all the affected cars, removing the feature—a recall, in industry terms, albeit a digital one. “There was a lot of back-and-forth,” Cliff told me. “Like, at midnight on the very last day, they blinked and ended up recalling the rolling-stop feature.” (Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.) Musk joined Tesla as an investor in 2004, a year after it was incorporated. (He has spent years defending the formative nature of his role and was eventually, in a legal settlement, one of several people granted permission to use the term “co-founder.”) Musk was again entering a market bound by entrenched private interests and stringent regulation, which opened him up to more clashes with regulators. Some of the skirmishes were trivial. Tesla for a time included in its vehicles the ability to replace the humming noises that electric cars must emit—since their engines make little sound—with goat bleats, farting, or a sound of the owner’s choice. “We’re, like, ‘No, that’s not compliant with the regulations, don’t be stupid,’ ” Cliff told me. Tesla argued with regulators for more than a year, according to an N.H.T.S.A. safety report. Nine days after the rolling-stop recall, the company pulled the noises, too. On Twitter, Musk wrote, “The fun police made us do it (sigh).” “It’s a little like Mom and Dad and children. Like, How far can I push Mom and Dad until they push back?” Cliff said. “And that’s not a recipe for a strong safety culture.” The fart debate had low stakes; the over-all safety of the cars is a far greater matter. Tesla has repeatedly said that Autopilot, a more limited technology than Full Self-Driving, is safer than a human driver. Last year, Musk added that he would be “shocked” if Full Self-Driving didn’t become safer than human drivers by the end of the year. But he has never made public the data needed to fully corroborate those claims. In recent months, new crash numbers from the N.H.T.S.A., which were first reported by the Washington Post, have shown an uptick in accidents—and fatalities—involving Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. Tesla has been secretive about the specifics. A person at the N.H.T.S.A. told me that the company instructed the agency to redact specifics about whether driver-assistance software was in use during crashes. (By law, regulators must abide by such requests for confidentiality, unless they decide to contest them in court.) Pete Buttigieg, the Secretary of Transportation, recently said that there were “concerns” about the marketing of Autopilot. Cliff told me he had seen data that showed Teslas were involved in “a disproportionate number of crashes involving emergency vehicles,” though he said that the agency had not yet determined whether the technology or the human drivers was the cause. In a statement, a spokesperson for the agency said, “Multiple investigations remain open.” Officials who have worked at OSHA and at an equivalent California agency told me that Musk’s influence, and his attitude about regulation, had made their jobs difficult. The Biden Administration, which is urgently trying to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, has concluded that it needs to work with Musk, because of his dominant position in the electric-car market. And Musk’s personal wealth dwarfs the entire budget of OSHA, which is tasked with monitoring the conditions in his workplaces. “You add on the fact that he considers himself to be a master of the universe and these rules just don’t apply to people like him,” Jordan Barab, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Labor at OSHA, told me. “There’s a lot of underreporting in industry in general. And Elon Musk kind of seems to raise that to an art form.” Garrett Brown, a former field-compliance inspector at California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health, added, “We have a bad health-and-safety situation throughout the country. And it’s worse in companies run by people like Elon Musk, who was ideologically opposed to the idea of government enforcement of public-health regulations.” In March, 2020, as pandemic lockdowns began, Musk e-mailed Tesla employees, telling them that he intended to violate orders and show up at work, and downplaying the significance of COVID-19. Soon after, he lost an initial fight to keep a factory in Alameda County—Tesla’s most productive in the U.S.—open. That April, after county officials extended shelter-in-place orders, Musk was on a conference call with outside financial analysts. His rhetoric became nakedly political, to an extent that would have been uncharacteristic just a few years earlier. “I would call it forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all of their constitutional rights,” he told the analysts, speaking of the lockdowns. “What the fuck?” he added. “It’s an outrage. An outrage. . . . This is fascist. This is not democratic. This is not freedom. Give people back their goddam freedom.” The pandemic seems to have sparked a pronounced shift in Musk. The lockdowns represented an example of what Hoffman told me Musk considered to be a cardinal sin: “getting in the way of the mission.” The following month, Musk sent a series of vitriolic tweets, threatening to file suit against Alameda County, to move Tesla’s headquarters, and to flout the rules and reopen his factory, all of which he eventually did. The county essentially rubber-stamped the reopening soon afterward—a far cry from what Musk had invited. “I will be on the line with everyone else,” he had tweeted, at the height of his frustration. “If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.” Musk has, for much of his public life, presented himself as a centrist. “I’m socially very liberal,” he told the technology reporter Kara Swisher in 2020. “And then economically right of center, maybe, or center.” He has said that he donated to Hillary Clinton, and voted for both her and Joe Biden. But, in recent years, the more radical perspective that characterized his diatribes about Covid has come to the fore. In March, 2022, Twitter restricted the account of the satirical Web site the Babylon Bee, after the site misgendered a government official. The next day, in texts later disclosed during the Twitter-acquisition process, Musk’s contact “TJ” (identified by Bloomberg as his ex-wife Talulah Riley) expressed frustration with the development and urged him to purchase Twitter to “fight woke-ism.” The following week, Musk polled his followers about whether Twitter respected free speech and, in a phone call to the Babylon Bee’s C.E.O., joked about buying the platform. Finally, in April, 2022, he offered forty-four billion dollars for the company. Almost immediately, he tried to back out of the deal, prompting Twitter to sue. After months of legal proceedings, Musk resumed the acquisition process, and in October he assumed control of the company. “Given unprovoked attacks by leading Democrats against me & a very cold shoulder to Tesla & SpaceX, I intend to vote Republican in November,” he tweeted last year. By the time he bought Twitter, he was urging his followers to vote along similar lines, and appearing to back Ron DeSantis, whose candidacy he helped launch in a technically disastrous Twitter live event. Although Musk’s teen-age daughter, Vivian, has come out as trans, he has embraced anti-trans sentiment, saying that he would lobby to criminalize “irreversible” gender-affirming care for children. (Vivian recently changed her last name, saying in a legal filing, “I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.”) Musk started spreading misinformation on the platform: he shared theories that the physical attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of the former Speaker of the House, had followed a meeting with a male prostitute, and retweeted suggestions that reports accurately identifying a mass shooter as a white supremacist were a “psyop.” Some people who know Musk well still struggle to make sense of his political shift. “There was nothing political about him ever,” a close associate told me. “I’ve been around him for a long time, and had lots of deep conversations with the man, at all hours of the day—never heard a fucking word about this.” When Musk arrived at Twitter, he immediately gutted the company’s staff, reducing the number of employees by about fifty per cent. One person who kept his job was Yoel Roth, the company’s head of trust and safety. Roth, who is in his mid-thirties, is gay, Jewish, and liberal. His department was responsible for determining Twitter’s rules; during the Trump Administration, he became embroiled in the culture wars. After the company began rolling out a new fact-checking policy that labelled two of Trump’s tweets as misinformation, Kellyanne Conway, President Trump’s aide, went on “Fox & Friends” and read out Roth’s full name and spelled his username, adding, “He’s about to get more followers.” Trump then held up a New York Post cover mocking Roth, and Twitter users began recirculating tweets that Roth had written criticizing conservative candidates. But when Musk took over he resisted calls to fire Roth. “We’ve all made some questionable tweets, me more than most, but I want to be clear that I support Yoel,” he tweeted in October, 2022. “My sense is that he has high integrity, and we are all entitled to our political beliefs.” That evening, Roth messaged Musk on Signal, thanking him. Musk responded, “You have my full support,” and, the next day, he followed up with a screenshot of a tweet from Roth that described Mitch McConnell as “a bag of farts.” Musk added, “Haha, I totally agree.” But the cuts that Musk had instituted quickly took a toll on the company. Employees had been informed of their termination via brusque, impersonal e-mails—Musk is now being sued for hundreds of millions of dollars by employees who say that they are owed additional severance pay—and the remaining staffers were abruptly ordered to return to work in person. Twitter’s business model was also in question, since Musk had alienated advertisers and invited a flood of fake accounts by reinventing the platform’s verification process. On November 10th, Roth sent a brief resignation e-mail. When his departure became public, Musk texted, asking to talk. “I[t] would mean a lot if you would consider remaining at Twitter,” he wrote. The two spoke that night, and Roth declined to return. Days later, he published an Op-Ed in the Times, questioning the future of user safety on the platform. (Twitter did not respond to requests for comment.) Link copied Soon afterward, Musk replied to a Twitter user surfacing a 2010 tweet from Roth, in which he’d shared a link to a Salon article about a teacher’s being charged with having sex with an eighteen-year-old student and asked, “Can high school students ever meaningfully consent to sex with their teachers?” “That explains a lot,” Musk tweeted in reply. Minutes later, he posted an image showing a portion of Roth’s doctoral dissertation, which focussed on the gay-hookup app Grindr and its user data. In the excerpt, Roth argued that such platforms will inevitably be used by people under eighteen, so they should do more to keep those individuals safe. “Looks like Yoel is in favor of children being able to access adult internet services,” Musk wrote. The attack fit a pattern: Musk’s trolling has increasingly taken on the vernacular of hard-right social media, in which grooming, pedophilia, and human trafficking are associated with liberalism. In 2018, when a Thai youth soccer team was trapped in a cave, Musk travelled to Thailand to offer a custom-made miniature submarine to rescuers. The head of the rescue operation declined, and Musk lashed out on Twitter, questioning the expertise of the rescuers. After one of them, Vernon Unsworth, referred to the offer as a “P.R. stunt,” Musk called him a “pedo guy.” (Unsworth sued Musk for defamation, characterizing the harassment he received from Musk’s followers as “a life sentence without parole.” A judge ruled in favor of Musk, who argued that he hadn’t been accusing Unsworth of actual pedophilia, just trying to insult him.) Musk’s tweet about Roth got nearly seventeen thousand quote tweets and retweets. “The moment that it went from being a moderation conversation to being a Pizzagate conversation, the risk level changed,” Roth told me. “I spent my career looking at the absolute worst things that the Internet could do to people. Certainly, worse things have happened to people. But this is probably up there.” Roth and his husband were forced to flee their house, a two-bedroom in El Cerrito, California, that they’d purchased just two years earlier. “And then as we are, like, packing our stuff and leaving and getting the dog loaded into the car and whatever, like, the Daily Mail publishes an article that gives people more or less a map to my house,” Roth said. “At that point, we’re, like, ‘Oh, we’re leaving this house potentially for the last time.’ ” This summer, Twitter’s cheerful blue bird logo came down from the roof of the company’s headquarters, in San Francisco, and was replaced with a strobing “X.” The new entity is a marriage between two parts of Musk. There’s his career-long quest to create an everything app—integrating services ranging from communication to banking and shopping, and emulating products, like WeChat, that are popular in Asia. Sitting alongside that pragmatic goal is a newer, more confusing side of Musk, embodied by his desire to take back the town square from what he sees as woke discourse. Twitter has become a private company, so it’s difficult to assess its finances, but numerous prominent advertisers have departed, and Meta recently launched Threads, a competitor that shamelessly emulates the old Twitter, and broke records for downloads. Musk threatened to sue, then challenged Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and C.E.O., to a cage match, pledging to live-stream it and donate the proceeds to charity. (Zuckerberg has accepted. Musk has delayed committing to a date, citing a back injury.) The illuminated sign atop X’s headquarters, after complaints to the Department of Building Inspection, came down as quickly as it had gone up. Some of Musk’s associates connected his erratic behavior to efforts to self-medicate. Musk, who says he now spends much of his time in a modest house in the wetlands of South Texas, near a SpaceX facility, confessed, in an interview last year, “I feel quite lonely.” He has said that his career consists of “great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress.” One close colleague told me, “His life just sucks. It’s so stressful. He’s just so dedicated to these companies. He goes to sleep and wakes up answering e-mails. Ninety-nine per cent of people will never know someone that obsessed, and with that high a tolerance for sacrifice in their personal life.” In 2018, the Times reported that members of the Tesla board had grown concerned about Musk’s use of the prescription sleep aid Ambien, which can cause hallucinations. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that he uses ketamine, which has gained popularity both as a depression treatment and as a party drug, and several people familiar with his habits have confirmed this. Musk, who smoked pot on Joe Rogan’s podcast, prompting a NASA safety review of SpaceX, has, perhaps understandably, declined to comment on the reporting that he uses ketamine, but he has not disputed it. “Zombifying people with SSRIs for sure happens way too much,” he tweeted, referring to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, another category of depression treatment. “From what I’ve seen with friends, ketamine taken occasionally is a better option.” Associates suggested that Musk’s use has escalated in recent years, and that the drug, alongside his isolation and his increasingly embattled relationship with the press, might contribute to his tendency to make chaotic and impulsive statements and decisions. Amit Anand, a leading ketamine researcher, told me that it can contribute to unpredictable behavior. “A little bit of ketamine has an effect similar to alcohol. It can cause disinhibition, where you do and say things you otherwise would not,” he said. “At higher doses, it has another effect, which is dissociation: you feel detached from your body and surroundings.” He added, “You can feel grandiose and like you have special powers or special talents. People do impulsive things, they could do inadvisable things at work. The impact depends on the kind of work. For a librarian, there’s less risk. If you’re a pilot, it can cause big problems.” On July 12th, Musk announced xAI, his entry into a field that promises to alter much about life as we know it. He tweeted an image of the new company’s Web site, featuring a characteristically theatrical mission statement: the firm’s goal, he said, was “to understand the true nature of the universe.” In the image, Musk highlighted the date and explained its significance. “7 + 12 + 23 = 42,” the text read. “42 is the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.” It was a reference to “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.” In the series, an immensely complex artificial intelligence is asked to answer that question and, after computing for millions of years, answers with Adams’s most famous punch line: 42. “I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you’ve never actually known what the question is,” the computer says. Earth itself, and all the organisms on it, are ultimately revealed to be a still larger computer, built to clarify the question. Adams does not portray this satirical vision as positive. Musk’s announcement suggested more optimism: “Once you know the right question to ask, the answer is often the easy part.” Musk has been involved in artificial intelligence for years. In 2015, he was one of a handful of tech leaders, including Hoffman and Thiel, who funded OpenAI, then a nonprofit initiative. (It now has a for-profit subsidiary.) OpenAI had a less grandiose and more cautious mission statement than xAI’s: to “advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity.” In the first few years of OpenAI, Musk grew unhappy with the company. He said that his efforts at Tesla to incorporate A.I. created a conflict of interest, and several people involved told me that this was true. However, they also said that Musk was frustrated by his lack of control and, as Semafor reported earlier this year, that he had attempted to take over OpenAI. Musk still defends his centrality to the company’s origins, stressing his financial contributions in its fledgling days. (The exact figures are unclear: Musk has given estimates that range from fifty million to a hundred million dollars.) Throughout his involvement, Musk seemed preoccupied with control, credit, and rivalries. He made incendiary remarks about Demis Hassabis, the head of Google’s DeepMind A.I. initiative, and, later, about Microsoft’s competing effort. He thought that OpenAI wasn’t sufficiently competitive, at one point telling colleagues that it had a “0%” chance of “being relevant.” Musk left the company in 2018, reneging on a commitment to further fund OpenAI, one of the individuals involved told me. “Basically, he goes, ‘You’re all a bunch of jackasses,’ and he leaves,” Hoffman said. The withdrawal was devastating. “It was very tough,” Altman, the head of OpenAI, said. “I had to reorient a lot of my life and time to make sure we had enough funding.” OpenAI went on to become a leader in the field, introducing ChatGPT last year. Musk has made a habit of trashing the company, wondering repeatedly, in public interviews, why he hasn’t received a return on his investment, given the company’s for-profit arm. “If this is legal, why doesn’t everyone do it?” he tweeted recently. It is difficult to say whether Musk’s interest in A.I. is driven by scientific wonder and altruism or by a desire to dominate a new and potentially powerful industry. Several entrepreneurs who have co-founded businesses with Musk suggested that the arrival of Google and Microsoft in the field had made it a new brass ring, as space and electric vehicles had been earlier. Musk has maintained that he is motivated by his fear of the technology’s destructive potential. In a podcast earlier this year, Ari Emanuel, the head of the Hollywood agency W.M.E., recalled Musk joking about an A.I.-dominated future. “Ari, do you have dogs?” Musk asked him. “Well, here’s what A.I. is to you. You’re the dog.” In March, Musk, along with dozens of tech leaders, signed an open letter calling for a six-month pause in the development of advanced A.I. technology. “Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks, and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth?” the letter said. “Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us?” Yet in the period during which Musk endorsed a pause, he was working to build xAI, recruiting from major competitors, including OpenAI, and even, according to someone with knowledge of the conversation, contacting leadership at Nvidia, the dominant maker of chips used in A.I. The month the letter was distributed, Musk completed the registrations for xAI. He has said little about how the company will differ from preëxisting A.I. initiatives, but generally has framed it in terms of competition. “I will create a third option, although starting very late in the game of course,” he told the Washington Post. “That third option hopefully does more good than harm.” Through A.I. research and development already under way at Tesla, and the trove of data he now commands through Twitter (which he recently barred OpenAI from scraping in order to train its chatbots), he may have some advantage, as he applies his sensibilities and his world view to that race. Hoffman told me, “His whole approach to A.I. is: A.I. can only be saved if I deliver, if I build it.” As humanity creates A.I. in its own image, Hoffman argued, the principles and priorities of the leaders in the field will matter: “We want the construction of this to be not people with Messiah complexes.” At one point in “The Hitchhiker’s Guide,” Adams introduces the architects of the Earth supercomputer. They’re powerful beings who have been living among us, disguised as mice. At first, they were motivated by simple curiosity. But seeking the question made them famous, and they began considering talk-show and lecture deals. In the end, Earth is demolished in the name of commerce, and their path to existential clarity along with it. The mice greet this with a shrug, mouth vague platitudes, and go on the talk-show circuit anyway. Musk isn’t peddling pabulum. His initiatives have real substance. But he also wants to be on the show—or, better yet, to be the show himself. In the open letter, alongside questions about the apocalyptic potential of artificial intelligence was one that reflects on the sectors of government and industry that Musk has come to shape. “Should we risk loss of control of our civilization?” he and his fellow-entrepreneurs wrote. “Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders.” ♦ First she scandalized Washington. Then she became a princess. The unravelling of an expert on serial killers. What exactly happened between Neanderthals and humans? When you eat a dried fig, you’re probably chewing wasp mummies, too.

     Elon Musk is a multi-billionaire technology entrepreneur and investor known for being the founder and chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla Inc. He is also involved in The Boring Company, a co-founder of Neuralink and Open AI. Musk is considered one of the most significant technology and space travel innovators of his generation. The South African native is a huge proponent of human colonization of Mars. Although he is considered one of the wealthiest people in the world, Musk lives in a simple $45,000 home in Boca Chica, Texas, near a SpaceX facility. His social media presence and innovative status have made Musk a popular cultural figure in American society. Many wealth and stock indexes average his net worth to be worth more than $200 billion, which rivals other billionaires such as Jeff Bezos. Moreover, the billionaire frequently gives his opinions on global politics and economics, often criticizing the Biden administration and members of the Democratic party. Musk received a bachelor's degree in economics and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He moved to California in 1995 and co-founded the software company Zip2 with his brother. The pair later sold the business to Compaq for $307 million. In addition, Musk was a part of Paypal in 2002 when it sold to eBay for $1.5 billion. Following the success of the late 1990s, by 2004, Musk had become involved with an electric vehicle manufacturer named at the time Tesla Motors. Musk helped grow the company into one of the leading car manufacturers in the world after becoming its chairman and product architect. Today Tesla Inc. is estimated to have more than $60 billion in assets, which helped Musk become one of the world's richest men. In 2018 he had to briefly step down as Tesla's CEO after the SEC sued him for tweets regarding a private takeover of the company. Tesla CEO Elon Musk's pro-natalist viewpoints and concerns about declining birth rates underscore a growing trend among Silicon Valley tech billionaires. FOX News host Greg Gutfeld reacts to Elon Musk sharing why he bought X, formerly known as Twitter, and criticizing George Soros on ""Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast on ""Gutfeld!"" Elon Musk unleashed on George Soros in an interview with Joe Rogan, accusing Soros of eroding ""the fabric of civilization"" and saying he rescued Twitter from the ""far-left."" Concerns are growing as a new era of AI deepfakes are flooding the internet, learn from a tech expert on how to protect yourself against faked media. In August 2023, the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against SpaceX, Musk’s rocket and spacecraft company. Tech billionaire Elon Musk has tangled with the German government on X over its policies regarding illegal immigration across the Mediterranean. 'FOX & Friends' co-hosts react to Elon Musk's trip to the southern border and the criticism received by far-left Rep. Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez for making the trip. Tech billionaire Elon Musk visited the southern border in Eagle Pass, Texas, on Thursday to get a sense of the real situation with the ongoing migrant crisis. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., had a sharp rebuke for X owner Elon Musk after he insulted her intelligence on his platform on Wednesday. Elon Musk wrote on X Wednesday, saying that he supports a border wall along the southern border as droves of migrants enter the U.S. illegally.

A newly constructed X sign is seen on the roof of the headquarters of the social media platform previously known as Twitter, in San Francisco, on July 29, 2023. Elon Musk killed off the Twitter logo on July 24, 2023, replacing the world-recognized blue bird with a white X. San Francisco city authorities forced the company to take down the sign right away for permitting reasons. Elon Musk's X, the company formerly known as Twitter, is suing a nonprofit that researches hate speech on social media, accusing it of conducting ""a scare campaign to drive away advertisers."" The suit alleges that the Center for Countering Digital Hate violated Twitter's terms of service and federal law by scraping data from the social media site. It claims the group cherry picks posts from the site to make it look like Twitter is flooded with hate speech and other harmful content, in order to silence users. In its complaint filed in federal court in California, the company alleged that CCDH and its British affiliate are ""activist organizations masquerading as research agencies"" and said the group was ""advocating for censorship on the internet."" Among the research that CCDH is best known for is a 2021 study showing that 12 people were behind most of the misleading claims and lies about COVID-19 vaccines on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. ""Musk is trying to 'shoot the messenger' who highlights the toxic content on his platform rather than deal with the toxic environment he's created,"" CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed said in a statement. ""CCDH has no intention of stopping our independent research â€“ Musk will not bully us into silence."" CCDH and other outside researchers have tracked increasing levels of hate speech on the platform since Musk bought it last fall. The entrepreneur, describes himself as a free speech absolutist, has loosened rules about what can be posted and reinstated the accounts of white supremacists, far-right extremists, and Qanon conspiracy theorists. Over the weekend, he allowed Ye, the rapper and mogul formerly known as Kanye West, back after a months-long suspension for posting an image of a swastika inside a Star of David.  Twitter disputes the claim that hateful content is on the rise, saying views of such posts have declined. ""Free expression and platform safety are not at odds,"" the company wrote in a blog post on Monday. Musk frequently uses heavy-handed tactics to take aim at critics. In December he suspended several journalists who covered the company (he reinstated most of them days later, under pressure from press freedom advocates), and banned a user who posted about the movements of his private jet using publicly available information. In 2018, he hired a private investigator to dig into a British man who had criticized Musk's efforts to help rescue a boys' soccer team in Thailand. Twitter's anger with CCDH appeared to come to a head after the group published a report in June saying Twitter did not take action against 99 of 100 tweets the group reported for violating the platform's rules against hateful conduct. Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino said the findings and other research cited in a Bloomberg News story about hate speech and violent content were based on ""incorrect, misleading, and outdated metrics."" ""Despite our continued progress, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) and its backers have been actively working to assert false and misleading claims encouraging advertisers to pause investment on the platform,"" the company wrote in Monday's blog post.  The lawsuit comes as Musk's chaotic management of the company and abrupt changes in policies and features have sent many users to Twitter alternatives, including rival Meta's newly launched Threads, and as Twitter's advertising revenue has plunged. It also comes at a moment when Republican lawmakers and right-wing activists are claiming that researchers who study online disinformation are actually trying to censor contrary views.

https://fortune.com/2023/08/21/elon-musk-plans-remove-headlines-news-articles-link-shared-on-x-twitter/,Elon Musk to remove headlines from news articles shared on X ...,20230801,"Aug 21, 2023 ... Tweets containing news article links will be stripped of headlines and other metadata (like this very sentence).","X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter, is planning a major change in how news articles appear on the service, stripping out the headline and other text so that tweets with links display only an article’s lead image, according to material viewed by Fortune.  Roughly four hours after the publication of this article, Elon Musk confirmed these plans, posting that “this is coming from me directly,” and it “will greatly improve the esthetics.” The change means that anyone sharing a link on X—from individual users to publishers—would need to manually add their own text alongside the links they share on the service; otherwise the tweet will display only an image with no context other than an overlay of the URL. While clicking on the image will still lead to the full article on the publisher’s website, the change could have major implications for publishers who rely on social media to drive traffic to their sites as well as for advertisers. According to a source with knowledge of the matter, the change is indeed being pushed directly by X owner Elon Musk. The primary objective appears to be to reduce the height of tweets, thus allowing more posts to fit within the portion of the timeline that appears on screen. Musk also believes the change will help curb clickbait, the source said. “It’s something Elon wants. They were running it by advertisers, who didn’t like it, but it’s happening,” the source said, adding that Musk thinks articles occupy excessive space on the timeline. The platform is known for its ongoing challenge in retaining advertisers, a problem that X Corp. CEO Linda Yaccarino has been dedicated to resolving over the past eight weeks. In practice, when a user encounters a shared article on their timeline (called a Card in Twitter lingo), it comprises several visual elements: an image, a short headline, and a brief description of the article. As outlined in X’s developer documentation, there are various types of “cards,” with news articles falling under the category known as “summary with large image.” The Cards format was developed years ago, at a time when tweets were limited to 140 characters. Since the text within the card does not count against a tweet’s character limit, the format was a vital way to share content on Twitter without exceeding the character limit. But because the headlines and other text in Cards are abridged to fit the format, the headlines often lack the intricacies of the a complete article (and, in the opinion of some critics, incentivize short, clickbait pitches). By eliminating all content except the image, X’s intention is that individuals sharing this type of content will be forced to write a more engaging post. And given that the $8-per-month premium version of the service now allows users to compose tweets containing as many as 25,000 characters in a single post, there’s more room for media companies, advertisers, and journalists to provide deeper context around an article—so long as they pay for the privilege. On Monday, Musk wrote in an X post that journalists who want “more freedom to write and a higher income” should “publish directly on this platform!” While the call for longer posts seems at odds with the objective of squeezing more tweets within the the timeline, Musk has a track record of managing Twitter with inscrutable, often seemingly contradictory moves. “The majority of product decisions are made because it’s something he wants or likes,” the source said. Musk, who acquired Twitter for $44 billion last year, has a testy relationship with the media industry. In April, Musk labelled NPR and the BBC “state-controlled media,” causing NPR to quit the platform altogether. And Musk’s efforts to remove content moderation rules and reinstate banned users including former President Donald Trump, have alienated many big-brand advertisers, who have since fled the service. The planned changes to shared articles are currently being tested internally, but it could not be learned when it will be rolled out to the public. An indication of this forthcoming change to the cards format was X’s recent introduction of overlaying URL links on images when accessing the platform on mobile, and removing the short description that can still be seen on the web side. The article headline still currently appears on mobile.  It’s worth noting that when X made its algorithm open-source, it revealed that external links are often given lower priority unless they have substantial engagement. X did not immediately respond to a request for comment. © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Anonymous Sudan hacks X to put pressure on Elon Musk over Starlink ... A hacking group called Anonymous Sudan took X, formerly known as Twitter, ...","A hacking group called Anonymous Sudan took X, formerly known as Twitter, offline in more than a dozen countries on Tuesday morning in an attempt to pressurise Elon Musk into launching his Starlink service in their country. X was down for more than two hours, with thousands of users affected. ""Make our message reach to Elon Musk: 'Open Starlink in Sudan',"" the hackers posted on Telegram. X is the latest victim of the gang hacking to ""benefit Sudan and Islam"". Over several weeks of private conversations with the group on the chat app Telegram, the BBC spoke to the hackers about their methods and motives. One member of the group, who calls himself Crush, told the BBC that Tuesday's attack flooded X's servers with huge amounts of traffic to take it offline - the same blunt and relatively unsophisticated hacking techniques for which the gang is known. The outage-tracking site Downdetector said nearly 20,000 outage reports were logged by users in the US and the UK, with a far higher number of people likely to have been affected. Another hacking group member - Hofa - said the so-called DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack was aimed at raising awareness about the civil war in Sudan which is ""making the internet very bad and it goes down quite often for us"".  X has not publicly acknowledged the disruption caused, and Mr Musk has not responded to questions to launch his satellite internet service in Sudan. Anonymous Sudan has been accused by many in the cyber-security world of being a Russian cyber-military unit in disguise and causing cyber-chaos for the Kremlin under the cover of a foreign hacktivist outfit. The theory stems from its online support for Russian President Vladimir Putin and an apparent alignment of motives with other hacking gangs in the country.  But the criminal group has repeatedly denied it is Russian, and for the first time shared evidence with the BBC that it is located in Sudan. Crush, the group's main spokesperson and key member, shared his live location on the Telegram app as proof. Crush and Hofa also sent pictures of their Sudanese passports and other screenshots suggesting they are in Sudan. These things can be faked with varying degrees of difficulty, but after weeks of conversation with the BBC and cyber-security researcher Intel Cocktail, there is nothing to suggest the hackers are lying. ""Our long-term goal is to show the world that Sudanese people, although with limited capabilities, have very good skills in many different fields,"" said Crush. In June, the gang posted a message of support for the Russian government to end an ongoing rebellion by the Wagner forces.  However, Crush explained that ""a similar thing happened to our country and Russians stood with us so we wanted to pay them back"", referring to Russia's support for the Sudanese government as it fights the ongoing civil war. He insists that their group is made up of a ""small number"" of Sudanese hackers who are launching the attacks from the country in spite of regular internet outages. Since it emerged in January, Anonymous Sudan has successfully disrupted dozens of organisations and government web services in France, Nigeria, Israel and the US. For the past month the gang has attacked Kenya, claiming the country's government is ""meddling in Sudanese affairs"".  One attack heavily disrupted the country's eCitizen portal used by the public to access more than 5,000 government services.  When challenged about the impacts on citizens, Crush defended the actions and said: ""The reason we hit infrastructure is to teach the country and its rulers a lesson, and yes we have red lines, that is if our attacks harm a lot of innocents."" However, the group has also unsuccessfully attacked hospitals. The gang claims to be carrying out the criminal attacks to ""defend the Truth, Islam and Sudan"", but on at least two occasions it has also tried to extort victims for Bitcoin. It has also targeted websites like OnlyFans, Tumblr and Reddit, saying that they promote what it calls ""disgusting smuts and other LGBTQ+ things"". In June, the hackers celebrated when the US cyber-authority issued an official warning about a wave of attacks against American organisations which it warned ""can cost an organisation time and money and may impose reputational costs while resources and services are inaccessible"". Its most high-profile attack in June disrupted Microsoft services including Outlook and OneDrive, forcing the tech giant to issue a report with advice to customers on how to prevent being affected by the group.

X would retain the mute function, which screens a user from seeing specified accounts but, unlike blocking, does not alert the other account ...","'X' logo is seen reflected on an apartment window across the street from the headquarters of the messaging platform X, formerly known as Twitter, in downtown San Francisco, California, U.S., July 30, 2023. REUTERS/Carlos Barria  Acquire Licensing Rights Aug 18 (Reuters) - Social media company X, formerly known as Twitter, will remove a protective feature that lets users block other accounts, owner Elon Musk said on Friday in another controversial move for the company he bought last year. The block function on X allows a user to restrict specific accounts from contacting them, seeing their posts or following them. ""Block is going to be deleted as a 'feature', except for DMs,"" Musk said in a post on the platform, referring to direct messages. He said X would retain the mute function, which screens a user from seeing specified accounts but, unlike blocking, does not alert the other account to the action. The billionaire owner has described himself as a free speech absolutist, but some critics have said his approach is irresponsible. Researchers have found an increase in hate speech and antisemitic content on the platform since he took over, and some governments have accused the company of not doing enough to moderate its content. Removing or limiting the block feature might bring X into conflict with guidelines incorporated by Apple's (AAPL.O) App Store and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google Play. Apple says apps with user-generated content must have the ability to block abusive users. Google Play Store says apps must provide an in-app system for blocking user-generated content and users. X, Google and Apple did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Responding to a post from anti-bullying activist Monica Lewinsky urging X to keep the ""critical tool to keep people safe online"", Chief Executive Linda Yaccarino defended Musk's move. ""Our users' safety on X is our number one priority. And we're building something better than the current state of block and mute. Please keep the feedback coming,"" Yaccarino posted. The company has said Musk would lead the product and engineering teams, while Yaccarino would lead all other teams, including legal and sales.

Facebook and YouTube are receding from their role as watchdogs against conspiracy theories ahead of the 2024 presidential election ... Three small ...","Social media companies are receding from their role as watchdogs against political misinformation, abandoning their most aggressive efforts to police online falsehoods in a trend expected to profoundly affect the 2024 presidential election. An array of circumstances is fueling the retreat: Mass layoffs at Meta and other major tech companies have gutted teams dedicated to promoting accurate information online. An aggressive legal battle over claims that the Biden administration pressured social media platforms to silence certain speech has blocked a key path to detecting election interference. And X CEO Elon Musk has reset industry standards, rolling back strict rules against misinformation on the site formerly known as Twitter. In a sign of Musk’s influence, Meta briefly considered a plan last year to ban all political advertising on Facebook. The company shelved it after Musk announced plans to transform rival Twitter into a haven for free speech, according to two people familiar with the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive matters. The retrenchment comes just months ahead of the 2024 primaries, as GOP front-runner Donald Trump continues to rally supporters with false claims that election fraud drove his 2020 loss to Joe Biden. Multiple investigations into the election have revealed no evidence of fraud, and Trump now faces federal criminal charges connected to his efforts to overturn the election. Still, YouTube, X and Meta have stopped labeling or removing posts that repeat Trump’s claims, even as voters increasingly get their news on social media. Trump capitalized on those relaxed standards in his recent interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, hosted by X. The former president punctuated the conversation, which streamed Wednesday night during the first Republican primary debate of the 2024 campaign, with false claims that the 2020 election was “rigged” and that the Democrats had “cheated” to elect  Biden. On Thursday night, Trump posted on X for the first time since he was kicked off the site, then known as Twitter, following the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. Musk reinstated his account in November. The former president posted his mug shot from Fulton County, Ga., where he was booked Thursday on charges connected to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. “NEVER SURRENDER!” read the caption. Musk’s ‘free speech’ agenda dismantles safety work at Twitter, insiders say The evolution of the companies’ practices was described by more than a dozen current and former employees, many of them speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer sensitive details. The new approach marks a sharp shift from the 2020 election, when social media companies expanded their efforts to police disinformation. The companies feared a repeat of 2016, when Russian trolls attempted to interfere in the U.S. presidential campaign, turning the platforms into tools of political manipulation and division. These pared-down commitments emerge as covert influence campaigns from Russia and China have grown more aggressive, and advances in generative artificial intelligence have created new tools for misleading voters. Experts in disinformation say the dynamic headed into 2024 calls for more aggressive efforts to combat it, not less. “Musk has taken the bar and put it on the floor,” said Emily Bell, a professor at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, where she studies the relationship between tech platforms and news publishers. For the 2024 presidential election, misinformation around races is “going to be even worse,” she added. The social media platforms say they still have tools to prevent the spread of misinformation. “We remove content that misleads voters on how to vote or encourages interference in the democratic process,” YouTube spokesperson Ivy Choi said in a statement. “Additionally, we connect people to authoritative election news and information through recommendations and information panels.” Meta spokeswoman Erin McPike said in a statement that “protecting the U.S. 2024 elections is one of our top priorities, and our integrity efforts continue to lead the industry.” Changing Facebook’s algorithm won’t fix polarization, new study finds Yet it is already changing what some users see online. Earlier this month, the founder of a musical cruise company posted a screenshot on Facebook appearing to show Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) signing a bill that would allow undocumented immigrants to become police officers and sheriff’s deputies. “In Illinois American citizens will be arrested by illegals,” reads the post, which has been shared more than 26o times. Fact-checkers at USA Today, one of dozens of media organizations Meta pays to debunk viral conspiracies, deemed the post false, and the company labeled it on Facebook as “false information.” But Meta has quietly begun offering users new controls to opt out of the fact-checking program, allowing debunked posts such as the falsified one about Pritzker to spread in participants’ news-feeds with a warning label. Conservatives have long criticized Meta’s fact-checking system, arguing it is biased against them. Meta Global Affairs President Nick Clegg said the ability to opt out represents a new direction that empowers users and eases scrutiny over the company. “We feel we’ve moved quite dramatically in favor of giving users greater control over even quite controversial sensitive content,” Clegg said. McPike added that the new fact-checking policy comes “in response to users telling us that they want a greater ability to decide what they see.” YouTube has also backed away from policing misleading claims, announcing in June it would no longer remove videos falsely saying the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump. Continuing to enforce the ban would curtail political speech without “meaningfully reducing the risk of violence or other real-world harm,” the company argued in a blog post. Inside the civil rights campaign to get Big Tech to fight the ‘big lie’ These shifts are a reaction from social media executives to being battered by contentious battles over content and concluding there is “no winning,” said Katie Harbath, former director of public policy at Facebook, where she managed the global elections strategy across the company. “For Democrats, we weren’t taking down enough, and for Republicans we were taking down too much,” she said. The result was an overall sense that “after doing all this, we’re still getting yelled at … It’s just not worth it anymore.” For years, many of Meta’s trust and safety teams operated like a university. Driven by curiosity, employees were encouraged to seek out the thorniest problems on the platform — issues such as fraud, abuse, bias and attempts at voter suppression — and develop systems to help. But in the last year and a half, some workers say there has been a shift away from that proactive stance. Instead, they are now asked to spend more of their time figuring out how to minimally comply with a booming list of global regulations, according to four current and former employees. That’s a departure from the approach tech companies took after Russia manipulated social media to attempt to swing the 2016 election to Trump. The incident transformed Mark Zuckerberg into a symbol of corporate recklessness. So the Meta CEO vowed to do better. Zuckerberg apologizes, promises reform as senators grill him over Facebook’s failings He embarked on a public contrition tour and vowed to devote the company’s seemingly infinite resources to protecting democracy. “The most important thing I care about right now is making sure no one interferes with the various … elections around the world,” Zuckerberg told two Senate committees in 2018, the same year a Wired cover depicted him with a bruised and bloody face. In the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, social media companies ramped-up investigative teams to quash foreign influence campaigns and paid thousands of content moderators to debunk viral conspiracies. Ahead of the 2018 midterms, Meta gave reporters tours of its so-called “war room,” where employees monitored violent threats in real-time. Civil rights groups pressured the platforms — including in meetings with Zuckerberg and Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg — to bolster their election policies, arguing the pandemic and popularity of mail-in ballots created an opening for bad actors to confuse voters about the electoral process. “These platforms were making all sorts of commitments to content moderation and to racial justice and civil rights in general,” said Color of Change President Rashad Robinson, whose racial justice group helped organize an advertising boycott by more than 1,000 companies including Coca-Cola, The North Face and Verizon following the police murder of George Floyd. Zuckerberg once wanted to sanction Trump. Then Facebook wrote rules that accommodated him. They instituted strict rules against posts that might lead to voter suppression. As Trump questioned the validity of mail-in ballots in 2020, Facebook and Twitter took the unprecedented step of attaching information labels such as, “This claim about election fraud is disputed” to scores of misleading comments. Google restricted election-related ads and touted its work with government agencies, including the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force, to prevent election interference campaigns. In early January 2021, rioters incited by Trump assaulted the U.S. Capitol after organizing themselves, in part, on Facebook and Twitter. In response, Meta, Twitter, Google and other tech companies suspended Trump, forcibly removing the president from their platforms. The moment was the peak of social media companies’ confrontation with political misinformation. But as the tech giants grappled with narrowing profits, this proactive stance began to dissolve. In the summer of 2021, Meta’s Clegg embarked on a campaign to convince Zuckerberg and the company’s board members to end all political advertising on its social media networks — a policy already in place at Twitter. Meta’s decision not to fact-check politicians’ speech had triggered years of controversy, with activists accusing the company of profiting off the misinformation contained in some campaign ads. Clegg argued the ads caused Meta more political trouble than they were worth. Two years after Jan. 6, Facebook mulls if Trump is still a threat While Zuckerberg and other board members were skeptical, the company eventually warmed to the idea. Meta even planned to announce the new policy, according to two people. By July 2022, the proposal had been shelved indefinitely. Internal momentum to impose the new rule seemed to plummet after Musk boasted of his plans to turn Twitter into a safe haven for “free speech” — a principle Zuckerberg and some board members had always lauded, one of the people said. After Musk’s official takeover later that fall, Twitter would eventually rescind its own ban against political ads. “Elon’s position on that stuff definitely shifted the way the board and industry thought about [policy],” said one person who was briefed on the board discussions about the ad ban at Meta. “He came in and kinda blew it all up.” How Mark Zuckerberg broke Meta’s workforce Almost immediately, Musk’s reign at Twitter forced his peers to rethink other industry standards. On his first night as owner, Musk fired Trust and Safety head Vijaya Gadde, whose job it was to guard the companies’ users against fraud, harassment and offensive content. Soon after, just days before the midterms, the company laid off more than half of its 7,500 workers, crippling the teams responsible for making high-stake decisions about what to do about falsehoods. The cuts and the evolving approach to moderating toxic content prompted advertisers to flee. But while advertisers were leaving, other tech companies were paying close attention to Musk’s moves. In a June interview with the right-leaning tech podcast host Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said Musk’s decision to make drastic cuts to Twitter’s workforce — including by cutting non-engineers who worked on things such as public policy but didn’t build products — encouraged other tech leaders such as himself to consider making similar changes. “It was probably good for the industry that he made those changes,” Zuckerberg said. (Meta has since laid off more than 20,000 workers, part of an industry-wide trend.) The Elonization of Mark Zuckerberg: How the Meta CEO is playing it cool Musk reinstated high-profile conservative Twitter accounts, including Jordan Peterson, a professor who was banned from Twitter for misgendering a trans person, and the Babylon Bee, a conservative media company. Musk also brought back Republican politicians including Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), whose personal account was banned for violating the platform’s covid-19 misinformation policies. He simultaneously suspended the accounts of journalists including Washington Post reporter Drew Harwell, CNN reporter Donie O’Sullivan and others who reported on Musk. A spike in hate speech on the site followed as users tested boundaries. The political winds facing Silicon Valley were shifting, too. Trump’s 2020 election rigging claims had inspired a slew of Republican candidates to echo his rhetoric, cementing election denialism as a core Republican talking point. In a May poll by CNN, 6 in 10 Republican voters said they believed Trump’s falsehoods that the 2020 election was rigged. Soon after Musk’s Twitter acquisition, scores of Republican candidates and right-wing influencers tested Meta, Twitter and other social media platforms’ resolve to fight election misinformation. In the months leading up to the midterms, far-right personalities and GOP candidates continued to spread election denialism on social media virtually unchecked. This year, GOP election deniers got a free pass from Twitter and Facebook Mark Finchem, the Republican candidate seeking to oversee Arizona’s election system as the state’s secretary of state, made a fundraising pitch on the eve of the 2022 election, falsely arguing on Facebook and Twitter that his Democratic opponent, Adrian Fontes, was a member of the Chinese Communist Party and a “cartel criminal” who had “rigged elections” before. When Twitter, seemingly in response to journalists’ questions, appeared to restrict his account, Musk declared he was “looking into” complaints that Finchem was being censored. Later that evening, Finchem was back to tweeting his message. He thanked Musk “for stopping the commie who suspended me from Twitter a week before the election.” Last year, Meta dissolved the responsible innovation team, a small group that evaluated the potential risks of some of Meta’s products, according to a person familiar with the matter, and simultaneously shuttered the much-touted Facebook Journalism Project, which was designed to promote quality information on the platform. “What was once promoted as part of an essential component of Meta’s role in helping secure democracy, election integrity and a healthy information ecosystem, appears now to have been expendable,” said Jim Friedlich, executive director of the Lenfest Institute for Journalism, which served for two years as a lead partner in helping execute Facebook’s journalism grantmaking. Trump’s ‘big lie’ fueled a new generation of social media influencers Now, Meta is eyeing ways to cut down on having to referee controversial political content on its new Twitter-like social media app, Threads. Instagram head Adam Mosseri, who led efforts to build Threads, said earlier this year that the platform would not actively “encourage” politics and “hard news,” because the extra user engagement is not worth the scrutiny. But even as it tries to retreat from the political culture wars, there’s no hiding from the coming election. Soon after the company launched Threads, Meta started warning users who tried to follow Donald Trump Jr. on the new social network that his account has repeatedly posted false information reviewed by independent fact-checkers. Trump Jr. posted a screenshot of the message on rival Twitter, complaining that “Threads not exactly off to a great start.” A Meta spokesperson responded by saying: “This was an error and shouldn’t have happened. It’s been fixed.” After the incident was over, Clegg told The Post he hopes in the future such politically fraught debates will disappear. “I hope over time we’ll have less of a discussion about what our big, crude algorithmic choices are and more about whether you guys feel that the individual controls we’re giving you on Threads feel meaningful to you,” he said."

Elon Musk is no fan of the Federal Reserve. At least a dozen times over the past year the owner of X (a firm until recently known as ...","Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Elon Musk is no fan of the Federal Reserve. At least a dozen times over the past year the owner of X (a firm until recently known as Twitter) has savaged America’s central bank for raising interest rates. Last December, for instance, he tweeted that its hikes might go down as the “most damaging ever”. But Mr Musk’s disdain for the Fed is not mirrored by the Fed’s attitude towards X. On the contrary, the central bank’s researchers rather like the website, treating it as a compelling barometer of the economy. This puts X in a peculiar position. Its value as a business remains dubious, which is why Mr Musk has been scrambling to remake it, with changes including (but not limited to) the company’s name. But its value to the economy is a different story altogether. The firm can serve as a timely indicator of both fundamental trends and market sentiment. There is a large, growing literature on how to decode economic signals from social-media sites, ranging from Facebook to Reddit. Yet even in the sea of online information and commentary, Mr Musk’s stands out. Others simply cannot match its volume and frequency. By 2013 Twitter users were already producing more than 5,700 posts in a second. By 2016 Instagram’s larger user base was producing only 1,000. Three papers recently published by the Fed explore the platform’s economic contributions. The first is as a predictor of markets. Sentiment gleaned from tweets seems to be rather good at presaging short-term movements in both share prices and bond yields. In one paper a group of economists including Francisco Vazquez-Grande sifted 4.4m finance-related tweets posted between 2007 and April 2023 to create a Twitter Financial Sentiment Index. They used a machine-learning model to measure each tweet’s sentiments: a message about stocks going to the Moon would be positive; Mr Musk’s quips about the Fed would presumably count as negative. The index, they find, correlates tightly with corporate-bond spreads (the difference between yields on corporate and government bonds, which usually widens as investors turn pessimistic). More than merely shadowing financial movements, posts can even foreshadow them. The overnight index before the stockmarket’s open dovetails with the coming day’s equity returns. A separate paper by Clara Vega and colleagues finds that the website’s sentiment also closely tracks Treasury yields. Indeed, the correlation is stronger with tweets than with sentiment measures gleaned from the Fed’s own official communications. A second use of tweets is as a gauge of economic conditions. Posts about job losses in particular seem to offer timely information about the labour market. Tomaz Cajner and co-authors construct a separate machine-learning model to digest posts with keywords such as “lost job” or “pink slip”. Their measure of job losses mirrors official data on employment levels from 2015 to 2023. This correlation is potentially powerful because most government statistics appear with a lag, whereas the tweets are available immediately. Twitter, for example, would have provided a ten-day advantage in detecting the collapse in employment at the height of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The Fed papers also see a third use for tweets: as a bellwether of sorts for monetary policy. Ms Vega and colleagues find that the social-media site fares better than changes in bond yields in predicting monetary-policy decisions on the day of their announcement. The Twitter sentiment index, meanwhile, is good at anticipating shocks from tighter policy such as rate increases. Tweets tend to turn sour just ahead of these moves. (That the website wastes no time in turning bitter will come as little surprise to regular users.) No one is about to ascribe powers of causation to X. The social-media posts instead reflect broader feelings that are already coursing through financial markets. Still, the cornucopia of tweets does provide an additional way of measuring such sentiment, which, if proved valid over time, would be highly valuable. Beyond the Fed, some analysts are also finding other potential applications. Agustín Indaco of Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar calculates that the volume of tweeting alone can account for about three-quarters of cross-country variation in GDP. Rather like satellite images of night lights, tweets may therefore be a way of observing economic health without relying so heavily on tardy official statistics. This metric may work best in poorer countries, where heavy posting on social media would be a proxy for the state of telecommunications and use of smartphones. If X is so economically useful, why is it not more lucrative? The various papers do not venture so far as to examine the gulf between Twitter’s struggle for profitability and its evident utility—not just as an economic tool but as a platform for sharing information, opinions, jokes and more. Mr Musk was onto something when he described the firm as a “common digital town square”. The problem in economic terms is that a town square falls into the category of public goods such as parks and clean water. Although public goods can be privately owned, it is notoriously hard to extract profits from them given that, by definition, it is difficult to charge people for all the benefits they confer. Mr Musk is doing his darnedest to shift the economic equation at X by giving additional privileges to users who pay $8 a month for the site’s blue-check verification. Tweets by users who cough up now receive extra promotion, among other benefits, showing up more often in the feeds of other people on the website. That, however, sets up a trade-off. Paid-for tweets may start crowding out better-informed posts from users who would rather not subscribe to the website. Over time, a website that prioritises payment over credibility will function less well as a town square and, by extension, as an economic indicator. The gain to X’s finances would be a loss to the Fed’s economists. ■ Read more from Free exchange, our column on economics:Deflation is curbing China’s economic rise (Jul 27th)Why people struggle to understand climate risk (Jul 13th)Erdoganomics is spreading across the world (Jul 6th) This article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline ""Fed-X"" Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents  A dispatch from industries on the front line of economic transformation The founder of the world’s largest hedge fund comes under scrutiny Markets have dealt them a bad hand.

Users who clicked a link on Musk's website, now called X, for one of the targeted websites were made to wait about five seconds before seeing ...","The company formerly known as Twitter has been slowing the speed with which users could access links to the New York Times, Facebook and other news organizations and online competitors, a move that appeared targeted at companies that have drawn the ire of owner Elon Musk. Users who clicked a link on Musk’s website, now called X, for one of the targeted websites were made to wait about five seconds before seeing the page, according to tests conducted Tuesday by The Washington Post. The delayed websites included X’s online rivals Facebook, Instagram, Bluesky and Substack, as well as the Reuters wire service and the Times. All of them have previously been singled out by Musk for ridicule or attack. On Tuesday afternoon, hours after this story was first published, X began reversing the throttling on some of the sites, dropping the delay times back to zero. It was unknown if all the throttled websites had normal service restored. The delay affected the t.co domain, a link-shortening service that X uses to process every link posted to the website. Traffic is routed through the domain, allowing X to track — and, in this case, throttle — activity to the target website, potentially taking away traffic and ad revenue from businesses Musk personally dislikes. The Post’s analysis found that links to most other sites were unaffected — including those to The Washington Post, Fox News and social media services such as Mastodon and YouTube — with the shortened links being routed to their final destination in a second or less. A user first flagged the delays early Tuesday on the technology discussion forum Hacker News. Musk’s throttling of rivals’ links stokes legal concerns Musk, a self-described “free speech absolutist,” did not respond to requests for comment. X also did not respond. Some of the targeted businesses said they were reviewing the matter when contacted Tuesday by The Post. Charlie Stadtlander, a spokesman for the Times, said in a statement that the news outlet has “made similar observations of our own” about the systemic delays and “not received any explanation from the platform about this move.” “While we don’t know the rationale behind the application of this time delay, we would be concerned by targeted pressure applied to any news organization for unclear reasons,” he said. Substack’s co-founders Chris Best, Hamish McKenzie and Jairaj Sethi said in a statement to The Post that they urged X to reverse the decision instituting a delay on Substack links. “Substack was created in direct response to this kind of behavior by social media companies,” they said. “Writers cannot build sustainable businesses if their connection to their audience depends on unreliable platforms that have proven they are willing to make changes that are hostile to the people who use them.” Online companies pour millions of dollars into ensuring their websites open as quickly as possible, knowing that even tiny delays can lead their traffic to plunge as users grow impatient with the delay and go elsewhere. A Google study of mobile traffic in 2016 found that 53 percent of users abandoned a website if it took longer than three seconds to load. A person familiar with the Times’s operations said the news organization had seen a drop in traffic from X since the delays began. Yoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety, posted on Bluesky on Tuesday that the delays seemed like “one of those things that seems too crazy to be true, even for Twitter,” but that he was able to replicate the issue through his own test. “Delays are annoying enough, even subconsciously, to drive people away,” he said. The Post’s tests could not show when the delays began, but the user on Hacker News, who spoke with The Post on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said he first saw links to Times stories get delayed on Aug. 4. On that day, Musk went on a tirade against the news organization, calling it a “racial genocide apologist” and telling people to cancel their subscriptions after the Times reported on a political controversy in South Africa, where Musk was born. Musk had previously berated the Times as “propaganda” and the “Twitter equivalent of diarrhea.” In April, he removed the “verified” badge from the news outlet’s now 55-million-follower account, making it harder for viewers to distinguish it from fake accounts. The delays also affected X’s biggest rivals in social media. Links to Facebook, Instagram and the new microblogging service Threads were all throttled; all three are owned by Meta, whose founder and chief Mark Zuckerberg has been locked in an ongoing online feud with Musk over not-yet-existent plans for a mixed-martial-arts fight. X also throttled traffic to Bluesky, the platform started with help from former Twitter chief Jack Dorsey, who has used it to criticize Musk’s leadership. The same throttling also applied to Substack, the email newsletter platform that runs its own short-text service, Substack Notes. Musk has shown little reluctance to use X’s technical tools to pursue personal grudges. In December, after Musk’s takeover, Twitter banned an account known as ElonJet that tracked the flights of Musk’s private jet, banned journalists who reported on the episode and suspended the official account of Mastodon for referring to the account in a tweet. The site also began using technical hurdles to make it more difficult for Twitter users to access Mastodon, including marking the website as “unsafe” and blocking users from adding Mastodon links to their profiles. ElonJet now posts on Threads, Mastodon and Bluesky."

In a post on the site, renamed X, Musk said: “The sad truth is that there are no great ‘social networks’ right now.” He added: “We may fail, as so many have predicted, but we will try our best to make there be at least one.” The sad truth is that there are no great “social networks” right now.We may fail, as so many have predicted, but we will try our best to make there be at least one. Over the weekend, a glitch on the platform meant that the site removed pictures and links on posts made before December 2014. The posts showed broken links instead of the pictures and videos that were previously there. Several users noticed the glitch, with the technologist Tom Coates among those pointing it out. Coates referred to the glitch as “epic vandalism by Musk” and suggested it could be a cost-saving exercise. Ellen DeGeneres’ famous Oscars selfie from 2014 was also removed but later restored. The photo became the platform’s most retweeted photo ever, with more than 2m shares on the platform. Former US president Barack Obama’s viral tweet after his 2012 election win remained unaffected. Some users speculated that the glitch was caused by an effort to save costs on storage data, while others attributed it to changes made on the platform in 2016 when it added “enhanced URL enrichment”, designed to show previews for linked websites and attachments beyond the company’s 140 character limit, according to The Verge. The malfunction came after reports last week that suggested access had been slowed down from X to other social media sites including the Meta platforms Facebook, Threads and Instagram. The five-second delay also appeared on links to some news sites such as the New York Times and Reuters. Earlier this year, users noticed that they could no longer post or send messages to each other, and saw a notification that said they were “over the daily limit for sending tweets”. Direct messages were also not working. The company apologised for “the trouble” in a post. Previous glitches have also left users unable to log in or view their own posts.

NY Digital Editor 
Elon Musk‘s latest tweak to Twitter, the former name of what he now calls X: Users will no longer be able to block other accounts — as Musk claims the feature “makes no sense.” 
	“Block is going to be deleted as a ‘feature’, except for DMs,” the tech mogul posted on X Friday. “Makes no sense.” 
	X/Twitter describes block as “a feature that helps you control how you interact with other accounts on Twitter. This feature helps people in restricting specific accounts from contacting them, seeing their Tweets, and following them.” Blocking other accounts is useful if someone is harassing, threatening or stalking you on the platform.    
	Among those weighing in on Musk’s pronouncement was Jack Dorsey, former CEO of Twitter, who approved of the decision: “💯. mute only,” Dorsey posted in reply to Musk. 	      	Instead of using the “block,” Musk suggested that X users can use the mute feature instead. Currently, however, the social network’s mute button simply removes an account’s posts from your timeline without unfollowing or blocking that account — whereas blocking an account prevents that account from viewing your public posts on X. When you “mute” X/Twitter accounts, they are still able to reply to your public posts (you just don’t get notifications, and replies are hidden from your view by default).  
	Musk has previously disparaged Twitter’s block function. In June, he posted, “Blocking public posts makes no sense. It needs to be deprecated in favor of a stronger form of mute,” although he didn’t elaborate on what a “stronger form of mute” might entail. 
	It’s unclear if Musk’s move to do away with the block feature will mean that any accounts a user has blocked previously will suddenly become unblocked. Reps for X/Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for clarification. 
	Alternatively, an X user can set their account to “private,” which allows them to control who can view and respond to their posts. “When you sign up for Twitter, your Tweets are public by default; anyone can view and interact with your Tweets,” the company explains on its help site. “If you protect your Tweets, you’ll receive a request when new people want to follow you, which you can approve or deny.” 
	Musk is the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and currently the wealthiest person in the world. He became the owner of Twitter in October 2022 after closing a debt-heavy $44 billion deal for the company (and promptly firing top execs and then laying off about 80% of Twitter’s personnel).  	      	Earlier this year, Musk hired former NBCUniversal ad boss Linda Yaccarino as CEO of X/Twitter. However, he has said that he will continue to oversee X’s product and technology teams, while Yaccarino is in charge of advertising and business operations.

Elon Musk, owner of Twitter (now X) has a long history of misrepresentations, evasions, and lies — from company policy to fighting Mark ...","
							By  	Miles Klee  To his many  fans, Elon Musk is the future. Whether that future means self-driving cars, brain chip implants, an “everything app,” a colonized Mars, or all of the above, they believe in the billionaire’s ambitions — and, crucially, his ability to bring them to fruition. 
	But why? Musk has an uneven track record as both innovator and entrepreneur. If he maintains a reputation for high-tech triumph, it’s in part because he’s been a relentless self-promoter, announcing new projects at such a clip that headlines can never quite catch up with the failed and abandoned ideas left in his wake. By appearing restless, driven, always in pursuit of the next big thing, he adds to the impression that he’s accomplished plenty already. 
	Along the way, he’s exaggerated, overpromised, skirted facts, and lied. A lot. There are lies to save face, misrepresentations to gain an advantage, and, perhaps most of all, bluster about when a scientific breakthrough will become a reality. There are also lies about stuff that doesn’t matter. (Like, at all.) Here we present a comprehensive but by no means exhaustive list of Musk’s habitual hucksterism, hyperbole, evasions, and outright fabrications. 
Is he flat-out  lying, or does he truly buy his own hype? For more than a decade, Musk has evangelized on the concept of a Hyperloop, or a pneumatic tube system for transporting people and vehicles at tremendous speed. He estimated in a 2013 proposal that a pod would be able to whisk passengers from L.A. to San Francisco in just 35 minutes and “feel a lot like being on an airplane.” Alternately, he has pitched such a design, sometimes derided as a crummy reimagining of the subway, for local use — as a way to avoid traffic in Los Angeles, for example. 
	A former SpaceX subsidiary, the Boring Company, spun out as a separate business in 2018, did build a few short tunnels, including a mile-long prototype tube near SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California. But other proposed loops never materialized. A route connecting the East Hollywood area of L.A. to Dodger Stadium, which was supposed to be finished in 2020, remains a fantasy; slated projects in Chicago and Washington, D.C. were quietly shelved.  
	There’s one instance, though, where it does seem to be less of an exaggeration than a cynical ploy to derail other plans. In the case of the L.A.-to-San Francisco tube, Musk told his biographer, Ashlee Vance, that he suggested a Hyperloop route because he wanted to kill plans for the proposed high-speed rail in California, which he viewed as too costly and inefficient. Today, the Hawthorne tunnel has been replaced by a parking lot, and the Boring Company’s sole operational loop is a 2.2.-mile route around the Las Vegas Convention Center, where customers ride in Teslas at fairly low speeds and, yes, still sometimes sit in traffic. 
	. 
This lie was  pretty blatant — so much so that he ended up facing SEC allegations of fraud as a result. Basically, Musk caused a seismic shift in the stock market on Aug. 7, 2018, when he tweeted, “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.” Though it was interpreted by some as an off-the-cuff stoner joke — Musk has often riffed on the so-called “weed number” — the post caused the automaker’s stock price to jump. Weeks later, Musk would walk back that announcement, citing shareholder pressure, and Tesla’s stock slumped by almost 40 percent in the following year. 
	In the immediate aftermath, Musk had to settle a fraud charge from the Securities and Exchange Commission over his “Funding secured” assertion, which the agency said “lacked an adequate basis in fact.” He and Tesla each paid a $20 million fine, and Musk stepped down as chairman of the company. In a subsequent lawsuit brought by investors who claimed billions in damages as a result of the tweet, Musk continued to falsely insist the tweet was accurate, even though the judge for the case had ruled it wasn’t. That judge wrote that “there was nothing concrete about [the] funding” Musk said he expected to receive from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund at the time. Despite the lie, Musk was ultimately found not liable for shareholder losses. 
Musk tends to  aggrandize the potential capabilities of SpaceX, and therefore finds himself regularly hinting at the rocket company’s rapid progress toward its ultimate goal of a human colony on Mars. You could call it misplaced optimism, but the fact remains that he keeps throwing out timelines for a manned flight to our neighboring planet only to later kick that can down the road. Experts voice their doubt whenever Musk offers an updated schedule, giving the impression that his estimates are grounded less in feasibility than ambiguous vibes. 
	In a 2011 interview, Musk said SpaceX could put a person on Mars within a decade, at least in a “best case” scenario — at worst, he claimed, it would take 15 or 20 years. That gave him a fairly wide window to make good on the boast, as well as splashy headlines for the 10-year frame. Obviously, 2021 has come and gone, but well before that, Musk was trying to manage expectations while maintaining that Mars missions were imminent: In 2017, he outlined plans to send an uncrewed spaceship to Mars in 2022, followed by a human voyage in 2024. The former did not happen, and nobody will be blasting off to the red planet next year, either. By 2020, Musk was “highly confident” SpaceX could send a crew to Mars in 2026. But the date has since been pushed back again: last year, Musk tweeted out his latest prediction, envisioning a landing in 2029. Technically, if SpaceX pulls it off by 2031, Musk’s original outside guess of 20 years will prove correct. But don’t hold your breath. For one thing, NASA scientists have said we don’t possess the means to make Mars habitable in the near future, contrary to Musk’s stubborn belief that we can terraform its surface. Hard to imagine the company flying people 228 million miles to a barren rock without any way to sustainably support life there.    
As the world  collectively held its breath for a Thai youth soccer team trapped in a flooded cave system in the summer of 2018, awaiting a logistically complex rescue, Musk thought he could solve the problem with a miniature submersible designed by engineers at SpaceX and the Boring Company. Although the sub was completed and sent to Thailand, it went unused, and British cave diver Vernon Unsworth dismissed it as a PR stunt. “It just had absolutely no chance of working,” Unsworth said. “Musk had no conception of what the cave passage was like.” Musk retaliated in a tweet, calling Unsworth “a pedo guy,” which would lead to a defamation lawsuit Musk eventually won. 
	Less well-known than the “pedo” smear, however, are the further lies about Unsworth that Musk sent in a subsequent email to BuzzFeed News, alleging without proof that the diver was involved in child sex-trafficking and had at one point taken a 12-year-old girl as a bride. It was all clearly made up: Unsworth denied everything, and none of it could be substantiated by BuzzFeed. Neither were there any facts to support Musk’s claim that Unsworth didn’t take part in the successful effort to save the trapped soccer team and was, moreover, “banned” from the rescue site. A fellow diver who participated in the mission commented that these remarks were “completely unfounded,” calling Unsworth “pivotal to the entire operation.” 
This isn’t so  much a lie, really, as a refusal to accept the limits of current technology. Tesla is a cutting-edge brand, manufacturing cars that are not only powered by electricity but outfitted with an entire suite of futuristic features. Yet there’s one technological milestone, continually touted by Musk as an inevitable achievement, that the company can’t crack: safe and reliable Autopilot. It’s no small problem, either. Musk said last year that Tesla is “worth basically zero” if it can’t deliver the autonomous driving system he has promised for a decade.  
	As long ago as 2015, when Autopilot was rolled out, the CEO was saying Model S drivers would soon enjoy the luxury of having their car navigate streets and freeways for them. The next year, Tesla offered a video preview of a fully self-driving vehicle in action — footage that was faked, according to testimony from a senior engineer this past January in a wrongful death lawsuit against Tesla over an Autopilot-involved crash. Musk has continued to claim, year after year, that a few months hence, Teslas will be able to drive across the U.S. without input from a human. We’ve yet to see it, and some shareholders have had enough. This year, an investor group sued Tesla and Musk, contending that he and other executives “significantly overstated the efficacy, viability, and safety of the Company’s Autopilot and [Full Self-Driving] technologies,” just days after more than 300,000 Teslas were recalled due to unsafe FSD behavior. (Musk has not publicly commented on the ongoing legal action.) 
	You don’t have to take the shareholders’ word for it, however: Tesla’s own employees have said that Musk exaggerates Tesla’s autonomous functionality. The company’s director of autopilot software informed the California Department of Motor Vehicles in a March 2021 memo that Musk’s estimate that the “car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of human” by the end of that year did “not match engineering reality.” Other communications between Tesla representatives and DMV officials have indicated a similar disconnect between Musk’s patter (he said in June that Tesla is “very close to achieving full self-driving without human supervision,” once again predicting fully driverless cars “later this year”) and actual progress on that front. Meanwhile, the Autopilot system has been involved in hundreds of crashes that have resulted in serious injuries and 17 deaths. 
It’s been a  bumpy ride for Elon’s X, not least because Musk has demonstrated a pattern of dishonesty regarding issues with the site, both before he assumed control of it and ever since.  
	When Musk stated his intention to acquire Twitter for $44 billion early in 2022, more than a few observers voiced skepticism — perhaps recalling the canceled take-private of Tesla in 2018. It’s entirely possible the mogul saw the offer as a joke or a bluff, given that he then made three attempts to back out of the deal before he was forced to complete it, in order to preempt a courtroom battle he was bound to lose. 
	As he tried to wriggle out of the purchase, he complained that bots and spam had overtaken the site, and after he was installed as CEO, he claimed to have eradicated “at least 90 percent of scams,” aided by a new paid verification system. None of that was measurably true.  
In the early  days of his Twitter ownership, Musk had the bright idea to appoint a council of individuals with “widely diverse viewpoints” to make big decisions on content moderation and whether to lift suspensions on prominent banned users, including Donald Trump. We never learned who those individuals might be, because no council was ever convened, and Musk began arbitrarily reinstating whoever he liked — including Donald Trump. Okay then! 
Another gimmick Musk  employed as he took the reins at Twitter was a bit of performative democracy: before he made significant policy changes, he would put a question to the entire site in the form of a poll and have users vote. At one point he even apologized for neglecting to do this, saying it would not happen again. But that was back in December 2022, and in the ensuing months, Musk has overhauled plenty of Twitter’s most recognizable elements  — from the elimination of the original blue check verification system to the institution of his “X” branding — without public input. His latest unilateral move? Apparently taking away the option to block other accounts.   
Musk prides himself  as a champion of open expression, loudly declaring that he’s a free speech absolutist. He cited the need to preserve such rights in the “digital town square” as a reason for buying Twitter. To that end, he reinstated a number of accounts previously suspended for hate speech or misinformation, and hyped up reporting on the “Twitter Files,” which were supposed to reveal the extent to which the site’s previous operators were engaged in left-wing censorship. (In fact, Twitter also fielded many requests from Republicans who wanted certain posts removed.) 
	In practice, however, Musk has proven himself a capricious censor in his own right. He’s taken steps to throttle links to competitor platforms including Substack, Bluesky and Threads, suspended journalists he dislikes, and limited traffic to specific media sites. He promised not to ban an account that tracked the movements of his private jet; then he went ahead and did so anyway. Twitter complies with more government censorship requests under Musk than it did before his arrival. Sure, he welcomed Nazis back to the platform, but other than that, his commitment to unchecked free speech has been minimal.     
It’s no secret  that Musk has liked and elevated a ton of transphobic content in his time at Twitter. But perhaps his most harebrained attack on the trans community was a declaration in June that the words “cisgender” and “cis” — clinical terms that simply describe a person whose gender identity conforms to the sex they were assigned at birth — would be considered slurs according to company policy going forward. In theory, then, anyone calling someone else cis on the platform would be subject to a suspension. Thankfully, this rule doesn’t appear to have been enforced anywhere. It’s just one more example of Musk not following through on what he says. 
Musk labeled the  eradication of child exploitation material on Twitter a number-one priority in November 2022. While it’s no surprise that he’s struggled to contain the problem (he gutted moderation teams and dissolved the company’s Trust and Safety council), he also personally intervened to reinstate the suspended account of a far-right QAnon influencer who had shared graphic child sexual abuse material. If that weren’t hypocritical enough, Twitter is meanwhile paying that same conspiracy theorist under its ad revenue sharing program. Most absurd of all, when Musk allowed this individual back on the platform, he tweeted that only staffers had seen the offending imagery. It was a blatant lie: the post had already been up for four days and, according to Twitter’s own metrics, was viewed 3.1 million times by users. 
Musk infamously tweeted  in March 2020 that he expected “close to zero new cases” of Covid-19 in the U.S. by the end of April. Instead, more than 1.1 million Americans died of the disease over the next few years. While this may simply be a case of failed prognostication, it did foreshadow Musk’s descent into contrarian, occasionally conspiracist narratives based on little evidence. 
	After he bought Twitter in 2022, he began to regularly amplify and engage with fake news on the platform, boosting a wide range of misinformation. In October, days after taking over, he shared a made-up article from a fringe website reporting that Paul Pelosi, husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, had gotten in a fight with a male sex worker that turned physical. (In truth, he’d been attacked by a politically motivated assailant looking for his wife.)  
	This year, he contested the identification of a mass shooter who killed eight people at an Allen, Texas mall as a white supremacist, speculating that a social media footprint proving as much could’ve been part of a “bad psyop.” He has also thrown his lot in with right-wing conspiracy theorists who say the Jan. 6 Capitol riot was a “Big Lie,” tried to sow fear around safe and effective vaccines, and has argued that businessman and philanthropist George Soros, a perennial target of antisemitic propaganda, “hates humanity.”  
	This month, Musk sued the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which researches hate speech and disinformation online, a sign that he will likely continue to dabble in both while denying that he enables accounts that peddle such content. When researchers found the advent of his Twitter regime coincided with an unprecedented flourishing of slurs and racism, he flatly contradicted them by presenting a graph devoid of any meaningful context. 
Recent weeks have  witnessed the stupid saga of Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg dancing around the prospect of a mixed martial arts “cage match.” Nominally predicated on Zuck’s newfound passion for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and the two men’s rivalry in the social media space (Meta recently unveiled a Twitter competitor, Threads, to great fanfare), the event has no set date but has inspired plenty of taunting on both sides — as well as bizarre untruths from Musk. 
	Musk went so far as to announce on Twitter that he and Zuckerberg had settled on several key details, including the decision to have their respective foundations oversee the match as opposed to Ultimate Fighting Championship. Zuck denied having agreed to this, posting on Threads that he wanted a professional MMA organization like the UFC to take part. Musk also said the battle would take place in an “epic location” among the ruins of ancient Rome, boasting approval from Italy’s prime minister and minister of culture. The latter official, Gennaro Sangiuliano, contradicted this, telling the Guardian that discussions were ongoing, but no Musk vs. Zuckerberg brawl would be held in Rome. 
	Finally, on Monday, Musk tweeted that during a Tesla full self-driving test that night, he would ask the car to take him to Zuckerberg’s house in Palo Alto to challenge him in person — and livestream everything. Needless to say, that didn’t happen, and a Meta spokesperson brushed off the threat. “Mark is traveling right now and isn’t in Palo Alto,” they said. “Also, Mark takes this sport seriously and isn’t going to fight someone who randomly shows up at his door.” 
	After so many years transparent fibs and fakery, where will Musk’s tenuous relationship with reality take him next? No doubt he’ll have to once again delay various Tesla products that have missed multiple release dates. He might get the chance to argue that SpaceX rockets don’t harm the local environment, thanks to a lawsuit alleging that a test launch this year started a brush fire and hurled chunks of concrete and metal shrapnel into a Texas wildlife refuge. And his pledge to fund the legal bills for anyone “unfairly treated” by an employer for what they post or like on Twitter should fall apart any minute now. 
	Still, don’t underestimate his penchant for misrepresenting something totally irrelevant to his professional life, like being “trained” in “no rules street fighting.” If Musk’s lying is predictable, the lies themselves are anything but.

Elon Musk says that X, formerly Twitter, will remove the ability to block users on the service, except for in direct messages.","By  Adi Robertson, a senior tech and policy editor focused on VR, online platforms, and free expression. Adi has covered video games, biohacking, and more for The Verge since 2011.  Elon Musk says X’s — formerly Twitter’s — block feature is on the chopping block, repeating his long-standing gripe against the basic social networking feature. “Block is going to be deleted as a ‘feature’, except for DMs,” Musk said in an X reply on Friday. He followed up with another post: “It makes no sense.” Musk has made his feelings about blocking known in the past months. In June, he said that Twitter should remove blocking in favor of “a stronger form of mute,” and he’s complained about large block lists and mass blocking campaigns against users who subscribe to Twitter Blue. But he also has a long history of promises that are delayed or never implemented — and removing the “block” feature might be a particularly unpopular change. Blocking provides some very tangible benefits, helping users (especially high-profile ones) do anything from avoiding harassment to simply cleaning up spam in their replies. It’s rare for large social networks to launch without a block button; when microblogging competitor Bluesky tried it this spring, it became a pain point that was changed almost immediately. “Block is a form of moderation for users,” noted Windows Central editor-in-chief Daniel Rubino after Musk’s tweets today. Muting is also a kind of moderation, but muted users can still stalk your posts or make unwanted replies that are seen by other people. Do Apple and Google require a block button? We might be about to find out Musk has referred to X and Twitter as a sort of digital combat arena that promotes freedom of expression by encouraging constant no-holds-barred communication, so it’s not surprising he would disdain this prospect. But there are questions about how it would work. As multiple people noticed, Apple and Google both include language that suggests social networking apps need a block feature — Google Play developers must provide “an in-app system for blocking [user-generated content] and users,” and iOS developers must provide “the ability to block abusive users from the service.” (While Apple’s language here seems ambiguous about whether users should have a block feature, one publicly posted iOS rejection message flatly says that “users need a mechanism to block abusive users.”) Musk has no particular respect for following rules, but he’s backed off picking direct fights with Apple in the past. It’s also not clear how technically difficult removing blocking would be. Musk has complained about the stability of the old Twitter code base while simultaneously slashing employees, including core technical team members. On top of the first-order effects of ending blocking, removing a core feature could have unintended side effects for a site that’s already suffered significant outages. That said, X is evolving under Musk. TweetDeck (now called X Pro) added a paywall earlier this week, and The Washington Post seemingly discovered a surreptitious throttling of links to Instagram, The New York Times, and other sites Musk dislikes — though it disappeared after The Washington Post report. Removing blocking (or making it a paid feature) isn’t necessarily imminent, but it’s not necessarily off the table either.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

             Archived News Para Notícias en Español The Justice Department filed a lawsuit today against Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) for discriminating against asylees and refugees in hiring. The lawsuit alleges that, from at least September 2018 to May 2022, SpaceX routinely discouraged asylees and refugees from applying and refused to hire or consider them, because of their citizenship status, in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). In job postings and public statements over several years, SpaceX wrongly claimed that under federal regulations known as “export control laws,” SpaceX could hire only U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, sometimes referred to as “green card holders.” Export control laws impose no such hiring restrictions. Moreover, asylees’ and refugees’ permission to live and work in the United States does not expire, and they stand on equal footing with U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents under export control laws. Under these laws, companies like SpaceX can hire asylees and refugees for the same positions they would hire U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. And once hired, asylees and refugees can access export-controlled information and materials without additional government approval, just like U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. “Our investigation found that SpaceX failed to fairly consider or hire asylees and refugees because of their citizenship status and imposed what amounted to a ban on their hire regardless of their qualification, in violation of federal law,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Our investigation also found that SpaceX recruiters and high-level officials took actions that actively discouraged asylees and refugees from seeking work opportunities at the company. Asylees and refugees have overcome many obstacles in their lives, and unlawful employment discrimination based on their citizenship status should not be one of them. Through this lawsuit we will hold SpaceX accountable for its illegal employment practices and seek relief that allows asylees and refugees to fairly compete for job opportunities and contribute their talents to SpaceX’s workforce.” The department’s lawsuit alleges that SpaceX discriminated against asylees and refugees based on citizenship status at multiple stages of the hiring process. For example: SpaceX recruits and hires for a variety of positions, including welders, cooks, crane operators, baristas and dishwashers, as well as information technology specialists, software engineers, business analysts, rocket engineers and marketing professionals. The jobs at issue in the lawsuit are not limited to those that require advanced degrees.  Asylees and refugees are migrants to the United States who have fled persecution. To obtain their status, they undergo thorough vetting by the United States government. Under the INA, employers cannot discriminate against them in hiring, unless a law, regulation, executive order or government contract requires the employer to do so. In this instance, no law, regulation, executive order or government contract required or permitted SpaceX to engage in the widespread discrimination against asylees or refugees that the department’s investigation found, as explained in the complaint. Because SpaceX works with certain goods, software, technology and technical data (referred to here as export-controlled items), SpaceX must comply with export control laws and regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Export Administration Regulations. Under these regulations, asylees, refugees, lawful permanent residents, U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals working at U.S. companies can access export-controlled items without authorization from the U.S. government. Therefore, these laws do not require SpaceX to treat asylees and refugees differently than U.S. citizens or green card holders. Find more information here on how employers can avoid discrimination when complying with export control requirements. The United States seeks fair consideration and back pay for asylees and refugees who were deterred or denied employment at SpaceX due to the alleged discrimination. The United States also seeks civil penalties in an amount to be determined by the court and policy changes to ensure it complies with the INA’s nondiscrimination mandate going forward. Please contact the department’s Civil Rights Division’s Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) at IERSpaceXcase@usdoj.gov or 1-888-473-3845 if you are or were an asylee or refugee who experienced any one of the following at any point in time: (1) You applied to a job at SpaceX and were rejected. (2) You were discouraged from applying to SpaceX because you were not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. (3) A recruiter or other SpaceX employee told you that SpaceX could only hire U.S. citizens and/or lawful permanent residents.

A research team led by Prof. Charlotte Chang of Pomona College found that in the six months following Musk's acquisition of Twitter, ...","Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter has not only seen the bluebird logo go extinct—about half of Twitter users who regularly engaged in environmental discussions have flown the coop. Prof. Charlotte Chang A research team led by Charlotte Chang, assistant professor of biology and environmental analysis at Pomona College, found that in the six months following Musk’s acquisition of Twitter—now known as X—nearly half of Twitter users identified as environmentally oriented had ceased being active on the platform. These active users, which the researchers called “Environmental Twitter,” were defined as posting on the topic at least once in a 15-day period. The research “directly builds on our previous work examining Environmental Twitter, where we found six different personas based on interests in biodiversity conservation, public lands or climate change mitigation,” Chang explains. “We saw that there was a vibrant community engaging in discourse around environmental topics. This then raised the question of how this community may be impacted by changes to Twitter’s governance.” The team compared Twitter use among 380,000 environmentally oriented Twitter users to a 458,000-user control group of those who used the platform to discuss the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Among these users, dubbed “Politics Twitter,” the drop-off was much less pronounced at only 20.6%. The research was published on August 15 in Trends in Ecology and Evolution. “Twitter has been the dominant social media platform for diverse environmental interests to communicate and organize around advocacy goals, exchange ideas and research and new opportunities for collaboration,” the authors wrote. Currently there is nothing on the horizon to replace it, putting at risk robust idea-sharing on topics such as extreme weather disaster responses, preservation of biodiversity and climate change. To prevent a decline in information-sharing and public mobilization around environmental issues, Chang and the research team recommend tracking and reporting what platforms—Threads and Mastodon are two candidates—are attracting support among environmental users. They also urge coordinated presentation of concerns to X and to those in charge of forming government policy. They also emphasize the efforts of the Coalition for Independent Technology Research. Chang says that the research took place between December 2022 and May 2023. It was supported in part by a grant from the Society for Conservation Biology and the Cedar Tree Foundation.

Elon Musk's X follower count bloated by millions of new, inactive accounts. We took a close look at Elon Musk's more than 150 million followers ...","Elon Musk is by far the most followed user on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, which he acquired in October of last year. With more than 153 million followers at the time of publication, Musk's account @ElonMusk is basically a microcosm of the platform as a whole. So, who are Musk's followers in relation to the platform? How active are they? How often do they post? Are they consuming a lot of creator content on X? Do they subscribe to Musk's subscription plan, X Premium, formerly known as Twitter Blue? Are Musk's followers real? Mashable has reviewed new data collected by third-party researcher Travis Brown, who compiled basic account information on all of Musk's more than 153 million followers via a meticulous process that respected X's rate limit parameters. What we found is...concerning. The most pressing question for the majority of people is likely whether Musk's followers are fake. Inactive is the better word to use here as it more aptly describes what the data shows. And a lot of Musk's followers have traits that would lead people to ascertain that they are not actually using the site. Of the 153,209,283 X accounts following Musk at the time the data was collected, around 42 percent of Musk's followers, or more than 65.3 million users, have zero followers on their own account. Just over 72 percent, or nearly 112 million, of these users following Musk have less than 10 followers on their account. When it comes to content creation on the platform, more than 62.5 million Musk followers have zero tweets. This would include users who have deleted all of their tweets by the time this data was collected over the past few weeks as well as accounts that have never before tweeted. More than 100 million Musk followers have less than 10 tweets posted to their account. Another very interesting detail from Musk's follower data is exactly when his followers created their accounts. Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter on October 27, 2022. Out of all of Musk's current followers, more than 25 percent, or 38.9 million, were created on or after that date.  The average number of followers for all 153 million accounts following Musk is just around 187. However, Brown tells Mashable that the follower ""distributions are so skewed"" that the averages aren't ""very meaningful"" here. The median number of followers for all 153 million accounts following Musk is just one (1) single follower. All of the above data points could signal fake accounts, describe users who are inactive, or even ""lurkers"" — users who exclusively consume content. It's likely a combination of all three. However, there are a few further stats that point more to the former two types of users. Over the years, many real X users have found there are certain attributes that point to an account most likely being fake or a bot. For example, if an account uses the default avatar or the auto-generated username that usually includes a string of numbers, there's a good chance you haven't come across a real, active user.  Just around 25 percent of all of Musk's followers, or more than 38 million, use the default profile image that X provides for newly registered accounts. More than 40 percent of Musk's followers, or just under 50 million, have 4 or more numbers in their @ handle on X. Furthermore, more than 43.8 million Musk followers follow less than 10 users in total via their X account. Around 13.5 million users only followed one single account, @ElonMusk, at the time the data was collected. One last data point of note is just how many of Musk's followers subscribe to X Premium, Musk's $8 per month paid subscription service formerly known as Twitter Blue. Musk has routinely promoted the product from his account, focusing on the premium features that come with it like the verification badge or monetization eligibility. A subscription to X Premium has often been associated with personal support for Musk himself by the platform's users. However, according to this latest collection of @ElonMusk follower data, only around 453,000 Musk followers or 0.3 percent subscribe to X Premium. Mashable reported earlier this week that there were around 830,000 X Premium subscribers in total based on another data set compiled by Brown. Rather than using workarounds, Brown works within X's boundaries — such as the site's API — to collect X Premium data, and says he fully respected the platform's rate limits when collecting X Premium data. This limitation, he explained, led to a delay. Due to these rate limits, Brown's data does not include the most recent batch of more than 200,000 accounts that followed Musk. In addition, more than 39,000 accounts collected have since self-deactivated. Just under 6,000 Musk followers had been suspended by the platform at the time of publication. Musk has recently claimed that X now has more than 540 million ""monthly users."" If accurate, that means more than 25 percent of accounts on the platform follow Musk. And if those numbers are inflated, it means that even a larger percentage of the entire platform follows Musk. With a huge swath of Musk's 153 million followers not using the platform or perhaps not real, it seems a good portion of X's overall user base may not be so active either.

Videos that show billionaire Elon Musk promoting a financial venture called Quantum AI use doctored footage and artificially generated audio to induce ...,"Australians can “get rich quick” by investing in Elon Musk’s financial scheme, Quantum AI. False. Videos using artificial intelligence technology to show Elon Musk promoting a financial venture are designed to mislead people into investing in a financial scam. By Lulu Graham American business magnate Elon Musk is the latest prominent figure to feature in doctored videos that use artificial intelligence technology to promote a financial scam. The videos posted on Facebook use authentic footage of Mr Musk dubbed with an artificially generated voice to make it appear as if he is inviting people to invest in a stock trading platform called Quantum AI. 
“By joining us early on, you can earn up to $3,000 by selling shares with high returns and minimal risk,” Mr Musk appears to say in the video. “This tool will make you financially independent in the shortest possible time.”  
The fake video, which has amassed more than 27,000 views, uses authentic footage of Mr Musk speaking on the Real Talk with Zuby podcast. During the podcast episode Mr Musk does not mention Quantum AI.  
Another fake video, posted under multiple accounts, appears to show a 9 News Australia report on Quantum AI, featuring Mr Musk promoting the investment scheme. 
The supposed 9 News Australia presenter says, in an American accent, “Australians will no longer have to work,” adding that “Elon also said that every resident of the country will be able to receive an income of $5,700 a day.” 
The video then cuts to a clip of Mr Musk where he purportedly says: “The latest platform, Quantum AI, will help people get rich quick, not work for every penny.” 
He appears to name Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates as “prominent shareholders” before the reporter directs viewers to “make a minimum investment of $400” on the Quantum AI website.  
This video also features authentic footage that has been manipulated with artificial intelligence.  
It shows 9 News Queensland presenter Mia Glover introducing a story about police being assaulted, along with footage of Mr Musk speaking at the 2023 World Government Summit.  In both cases, their voices have been dubbed over with artificially generated voices. Ms Glover, for instance, is speaking with an American accent instead of her native Australian accent. 
Furthermore, if the viewer watches the 1:29 minute video through to the end, it shows the message, “Learn more 9news.com.au”, which is the real address of the 9 News website. However, the link actually takes viewers to an imitation website with a different URL.  
The imitation website features a report, “Tesla launches its newest platform Quantum AI™ - aims to help families become wealthier”, under the byline Jonathan Ponciano – which is also the name of an associate editor of Forbes magazine.  
The fake website shows today’s date and the current time as of when the viewer opens it, but the time ceases to progress, and all the news links embedded lead to more promotions of the Quantum AI scam. 
RMIT University’s Associate Dean of Artificial Intelligence, Professor John Thangarajah, told RMIT FactLab there is growing concern over AI-generated content being used in financial scams. 
“This is the current equivalent of email scams that trick you with text. These scams elevate it with audio/visual elements,” he said. 
Specifically, in both AI-generated videos, Mr Musk’s lips appear blurred which, according to the eSafety Commissioner, can be an indication of deepfake technology. In the videos, Mr Musk’s lips are out of sync with the robotic audio. MIT project Detect DeepFake labels this as another sign to look for when analysing if voice cloning has been used.  
Voice cloning is when a computer program is used to generate a synthetic, adaptable copy of a person's voice. Readily available software allows a user to copy a voice then use it to read whatever text the user creates. 
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s ScamWatch notes that celebrity endorsement investment scams are common.  
FactLab also previously investigated videos of Gina Rinehart and Richard Branson promoting a get-rich-quick scheme and found them to be fake. 
According to the ACCC, Australians reported losing $3.1 billion to scams in 2022, which was an 80% increase on 2021 figures.  
Information on how to identify investment scams can be found on the ACCC ScamWatch website. False. Videos that show billionaire Elon Musk promoting a financial venture called Quantum AI use doctored footage and artificially generated audio to induce Facebook users to send money to scammers.

By Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, has sued a group of researchers — alleging their work highlighting an increase in hate speech on the platform cost the company millions of dollars of advertising revenue. The suit, filed late Monday night in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California, accuses the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate of violating X’s terms of service by improperly collecting a vast amount of data for its analysis. The suit also alleges, without offering evidence, that the organization is funded by foreign governments and media companies who view X as competition. The legal fight between the tech company, which was acquired by Elon Musk last year, and the center could have significant implications for a growing number of researchers and advocacy groups that seek to help the public understand how social media is shaping society and culture. With offices in the U.S. and United Kingdom, the center regularly publishes reports on hate speech, extremism and harmful behavior on social media platforms like X, TikTok or Facebook. The organization has published several reports critical of Musk’s leadership, detailing an increase in anti-LGBTQ hate speech as well as climate misinformation since his purchase. In its lawsuit, X alleges the center violated its terms of service by automatically scraping large amounts of data from the site without the company’s permission. X also claims the center improperly accessed internal Twitter data, using log-on credentials it obtained from an employee at a separate company that has a business relationship with X. Without naming any individuals or companies, the suit says the center receives funding from foreign governments as well as organizations with ties to “legacy media organizations” that see X as a rival. The suit claims the center’s work has cost X tens of millions of dollars in lost ad revenue. In response to the legal action, Imran Ahmed, the center’s founder and CEO, defended its work and accused Musk of using the lawsuit to silence criticism of his leadership, as well as research into the role X plays in spreading misinformation and hate speech. “Musk is trying to ‘shoot the messenger’ who highlights the toxic content on his platform rather than deal with the toxic environment he’s created,” Ahmed said. The center’s 2021 tax forms show it took in $1.4 million in revenue. A review of major donors shows several large charities, including the National Philanthropic Trust in the U.S. and the Oak Foundation and Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust in the U.K. A spokesman for the group said the center receives no funding from any government entities or tech companies that could be considered competitors to X. The identities of other donors is not revealed in public documents, and the center declined to provide a list. Musk is a self-professed free speech absolutist who has welcomed back white supremacists and election deniers to the platform, which he renamed X last month. He initially had promised that he would allow any speech on his platform that wasn’t illegal. “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” Musk wrote in a tweet last year. Nevertheless, the billionaire has at times proven sensitive about critical speech directed at him or his companies. Last year, he suspended the accounts of several journalists who covered his takeover of Twitter."

Elon Musk says he may need surgery, casting more doubt on his proposed cage match with Mark Zuckerberg. Musk noted on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday evening that he's receiving an MRI on his neck and upper back today. He'll find out later this week whether he'll need surgery before going toe-to-toe with Zuckerberg, which is definitely not an attempt to get a doctor's note to weasel out of the duel. Exact date is still in flux. I’m getting an MRI of my neck & upper back tomorrow. May require surgery before the fight can happen. Will know this week. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 7, 2023 Not only would surgery postpone that fight indefinitely, it could have a negative impact on Musk's work at his various companies. As CNBC notes, Tesla's share price dropped by over two percent on Monday morning. Along with running the automaker, Musk is also the owner and chief technical officer of X and CEO of SpaceX. There wasn't a confirmed date for the Elon Musk vs. Mark Zuckerberg fight anyway. Zuckerberg said he proposed an August 26 fight night, but claimed Musk hadn't responded. ""Not holding my breath,"" the Meta CEO wrote on Threads. Both Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have been training for the potential showdown and publicly needling each other in the meantime. If and when it happens, Musk said the fight will be streamed on X, with all proceeds going to a veterans' charity. Zuckerberg couldn't resist poking fun at Musk over that too. ""Shouldn't we use a more reliable platform that can actually raise money for charity?"" he asked. Speeding, airborne Dodge Charger hit by a city bus destroys a restaurant.

The day-to-day headlines about billionaire Elon Musk are almost always about Tesla or changes to Twitter, now rebranded as X. But a new expose by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ronan Farrow explores the quiet growth of Musk's power and influence through his space exploration company, SpaceX, which provides internet service through its satellite company, Starlink. To put this in perspective, it's estimated that more than 8,000 active satellites are spinning around the Earth, and more than half of them are controlled by Elon Musk, providing internet connections to more than 60 countries. This past June, Musk signed a contract with the Department of Defense to continue providing service to Ukraine, which has been instrumental on the battlefield in its war with Russia. Ronan Farrow's new report in The New Yorker explores the geopolitical consequences of Musk's growing power, including how the U.S. government has come to rely heavily on him. Ronan Farrow is an investigative reporter and a contributing writer to The New Yorker. He won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the sexual assault allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein, which propelled the #MeToo movement. His latest film ""Endangered"" on HBO about the threats to journalists is nominated for an Emmy. Farrow is currently producing a film about the use of commercial spyware. His article ""Elon Musk's Shadow Rule"" is in this week's issue of The New Yorker. And, Ronan Farrow, welcome to FRESH AIR. RONAN FARROW: Such a pleasure to be here, Tonya. MOSLEY: Yes. A pleasure to have you. And thank you for this reporting. You know, you make a point to say that there's nothing wrong with the relationship between a private individual like Elon Musk and government leadership. But what your investigation is interrogating is actually how government agencies are struggling to rein him in. And an example of this is Ukraine's reliance on Starlink. So first, can we quickly go over how Starlink came to be the backbone of communication on the battlefield in Ukraine? FARROW: When Russia invaded Ukraine last year, there was a quick realization that this would be a modern form of warfare that entailed attacks on Ukraine's internet infrastructure. Very quickly, as Ukrainians and also Ukrainian ex-pats in the Silicon Valley community, in Big Tech grappled with what alternatives could be put in place, they stumbled on Starlink, which is a product made by Elon Musk's SpaceX space exploration company. And it's a mobile satellite station where you get a little dish and it has limited range, but you can point it at the sky and get internet access in that limited area. And the downside of this is that it's very disaggregated, and you need a lot of them to provide internet infrastructure in a country like Ukraine. But the upside is Russia, with that kind of a disaggregated network, wouldn't be able to take out their internet access in one swoop. One attack couldn't bring them down in terms of their basic communications abilities. And that's very significant because in addition to internet access being needed for all kinds of civilian utilities - you know, everything that we all use it for, everything from the running of hospitals to schools - you know, it's also, in a war context, absolutely indispensable on the front lines. The only way you can have commanders communicating with battalions is through some kind of internet connectivity. So at first, Musk was incredibly enthused about this. There was a lot of tweeting back-and-forth where Ukrainian officials were asking him in earnest for his help, and he said, you know, right away, I'm getting Starlink units there. And there was a significant charitable outlay, you know, in addition to units that were furnished through a deal with USAID and through fundraising efforts in that community of Big Tech Ukrainian ex-pats. In addition to that, Starlink was putting its own resources into this. So that's how the story about the Ukraine piece of this starts. He seemed fully on the Ukrainians' side and willing to defend their cause. MOSLEY: OK. So that's how it starts, and that makes sense. He was very excited at the beginning to be a part of the solution. Then there was a situation when Starlink stopped working in Ukraine. What happened? FARROW: Essentially, as Ukrainian soldiers moved into areas in the south, most hotly contested by Russia, they just blacked out, communications-wise. They lost the ability to do that essential coordination of their ability to attack, ability to defend themselves. It was chaos. You know, I talked to both officials at a higher level in the Ukrainian government and also people on the ground, on the front lines, as this happened. And, you know, they really did just lose units. And commanders had to drive out to near the front lines and put themselves at risk. And, you know, it's very difficult in the theater of war to definitively tease out cause-and-effect relationships, right? There's always a constellation of factors that lead to losses. So I want to be careful about quantifying the impact of this. But, certainly, the feeling of both Ukrainian and American officials that I spoke to was that there were significant operational costs, and some people really did genuinely feel losses of lives as a result of this. MOSLEY: Right. And at the time of all of this, Colin Kahl was the undersecretary of defense for policy at the Pentagon. What did he tell you about how he had to deal with Musk to keep the satellites working? FARROW: So very quickly, as frantic calls went from Ukrainians on the ground, on the front lines to Ukrainian officials, to American officials at the Pentagon, the determination was made that this was likely the result of Elon Musk and SpaceX doing what's called geofencing - you know, cordoning off areas of internet access. You can use it over here, but you step a few feet over that way and it's turned off is the essential idea. And this was an unforeseen problem, right? When they got on the Elon Musk roller coaster, everyone just thought, wow, how great, a solution. And people really didn't think of his ability to flip a switch in this way. So the fear became not only what's going to happen if he continues to not allow connectivity in areas where Russia doesn't want connectivity. But also, what if he turns off the whole thing? Because in this same period of time, he was signaling very loudly that he was fatiguing of paying these exorbitant bills to subsidize Ukrainian internet access. A letter went from SpaceX to the Pentagon saying, you know, basically, you need to start paying for this or we're out. So there was a moment that I capture where a variety of Pentagon officials were panicking - is one word that one of them told me - and where the official you mentioned, Colin Kahl, after a whole lot of planning conversations, got assigned the task of calling Elon Musk and basically begging for more time, asking if he would give the Pentagon, you know, even just weeks to come up with a contract where they could basically pay him to keep him from turning this thing off. MOSLEY: Right. This is the crux of your article, 'cause what makes it alarming is that Musk can decide at any time, basically, to flip that switch to shut down Starlink. Government officials are basically at his mercy. FARROW: Yeah, and really said as much, virtually word-for-word. This was, in some ways, an unfamiliar situation because at the time that this story started unfolding, there wasn't a deal between Musk and the Pentagon to provide Starlink in Ukraine. Nevertheless, he was a private citizen with a private company who had become the arbiter of the outcome of this war. I mean, it's really very little overstatement to say that. This was absolutely essential in the eyes of everyone on the ground. And the government found itself in the unusual position of having no levers of control over the private individual who was about to determine so much. So the plan was made for conversations to happen with him. There was a call, as you mentioned, from this official, Colin Kahl, at the Pentagon to Elon Musk. Elon also called General Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for advice about this. They are close. They've become friends. And Milley speaks highly of Musk in this piece. Another interesting aspect of the balance of power you're asking about is that even to this day, there is a real reluctance on the part of government officials to talk openly about how frustrated and worried they were. You know, eventually over the course of this reporting, I got people to open up about that. But there's a real reluctance because they continue to fear aggravating someone who could so acutely affect how things are unfolding on the ground just with the flip of a switch. MOSLEY: Let's take a short break, Ronan. If you're just joining us, my guest today is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ronan Farrow. He's written a new piece for The New Yorker titled ""Elon Musk's Shadow Rule: How The U.S. Government Came To Rely On The Tech Billionaire - And Is Now Struggling To Rein Him In."" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DAN AUERBACH SONG, ""HEARTBROKEN, IN DISREPAIR"") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. And today we're talking to investigative journalist Ronan Farrow about his latest investigative piece for The New Yorker titled ""Elon Musk's Shadow Rule."" It's about Musk's rising influence in government relations. Farrow is a Pulitzer Prize winner for his 2017 expose on the sexual assault and misconduct allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein. Farrow is also the author of ""War On Peace: The End Of Diplomacy And The Decline Of American Influence"" and ""Catch And Kill: Lie, Spies, And A Conspiracy To Protect Predators."" I want to gain some clarity on something from Musk's point of view, because it is a huge task to fund for service in Ukraine during an act of war. Was it all about money for Musk? FARROW: I don't doubt the sincerity of SpaceX's and Elon Musk's concerns about the significant costs they were incurring. However, it does seem far more likely that a constellation of different factors contributed to Elon Musk's marked change in posture over the course of that better part of a year of funding Starlink and providing Starlink units. He, over the course of that period of time, was, we've now learned and I report in this story, in conversations with the Russians. He has denied that since. But he told that official, Colin Kahl, and others that I spoke to at the time that he had talked to Vladimir Putin. And, you know, there's a moment in this call that I describe with Colin where Musk is looking at a map of the battlefield and seeing, because he has access to all of this proprietary information, exactly where Starlink units are being used. So he can really see where the troops are moving, what's going to happen. You know, and then in the same conversation, he says, I had - as one official framed it, I had this great conversation with Vladimir Putin. And understandably, that's a cause for concern on the part of American and Ukrainian officials. MOSLEY: So just to get this clear, Musk was on a laptop, and he could see the entire war unfolding through this map of Starlink. And he possibly had a conversation with Putin. But he has later denied that and said that that did not happen. But what are the implications of that, I mean, for a private citizen like Elon Musk to be in conversation with a leader like Vladimir Putin during an act of war? FARROW: You know, he is within his rights to talk to whomever he wants as a private individual. But the discomfort with this situation comes from the just outsized power that he has. In that theater of war, in geopolitics right now, he is more like a nation-state than an individual in terms of the implications of his power and what happens in his diplomatic conversations. And, you know, I point out, not only does my reporting and the accounts of, you know, Colin Kahl and all these other people I spoke to contradict that later denial from Musk. You know, he later said, I have never talked to Putin during this conflict or about Ukraine. He was very clearly saying to people at the time, multiple people, that he had talked to Putin in this time period about this. Further, he was also saying that he was in more regular conversations with the Kremlin that included other officials. And this is all consequential not just in principle, for the reasons I described - that when you ascribe this much power to an individual, who they're negotiating with, who they're hearing out, whose logic they're taking on board becomes very consequential to a lot of human lives. It also is consequential in more specific ways with respect to Elon Musk because he is, you know, in this particular context, deciding where troops can move. And he's tweeting, at the same time, pro-Putin, pro-Russia proposals for a peace plan. So he himself, through his actions, is actually, in some ways, embracing this role of being an ad hoc statesperson. We see that in a lot of settings with him. He - he'll go to China and he'll pose with, you know, officials in the kind of stuffy, smiling handshake photos that are usually the domain of the diplomat, the, you know, formerly elected official. And in this case, he also sort of took up that mantle in his way. He tweeted out a poll like, what about if, you know, there's a referendum that could potentially give Russia what they want in these specific areas? And he began saying publicly, too, in various fora, we should be talking to Putin more. So the implications, in other words, are both general, in the sense that we have this extraordinary situation where his decisions and conversations matter so much, and specific in that he did seem to be taking on the arguments of the Russian side of this conflict. And that all coincided with real consequences on the battlefield. MOSLEY: Playing that diplomat role, along with his relationship with China, how does his relationship with China actually play into his uneasiness with Ukraine using Starlink on the battlefield? Because we know about China's relationship with Russia. FARROW: So China has backed Russia in this conflict, as it often does. And Elon Musk has been open about saying that when he has been in conversations with the Chinese, they have expressed their displeasure with his supporting the Ukrainian war effort. They've been alarmed at the idea that he might ever do the same in China, where the internet is very tightly controlled and censored. And they obviously don't love the idea of outside private companies coming in and dispersing free access to, you know, an internet that they can't control as much. So they've explicitly raised this with Musk. That is important in the context of his sort of China diplomacy that we're talking about, because a huge portion of Tesla's business depends on Chinese manufacturing. I believe the lion's share of Teslas actually come out of a plant in Shanghai - a factory in Shanghai. So he needs that labor. He needs the good graces of the Chinese government to allow him to continue operating there. And you wind up in a situation where, you know, there's nothing wrong with a businessman balancing these kinds of pragmatic concerns - right? - about the bottom line. But it adds a very different dimension because he's also more than just a businessman now in these contexts. MOSLEY: And back to the consequences on the battlefield. What would be the consequences if Starlink pulled out of Ukraine? FARROW: Well, what we saw in miniature on the front lines, where they couldn't go into certain areas and had to pull back and it was chaos, would happen on a much larger scale. I mean, if all Starlink turned off in that country, by now, where - at which point it's become the entire backbone of Ukrainian infrastructure, both on the civilian and the military side, you know, you would see hospitals and schools shut down. You would see a paralysis of the ability of troops to move around and coordinate. It's really an untenable situation. And that's what created this moment where people were and are still so afraid of aggravating Elon Musk. Because although the outcome of this story is he gave the Pentagon more time, they eventually announced a formalized deal with SpaceX to provide Starlink in Ukraine, Elon Musk and his, you know, lieutenants, if you will, at SpaceX have been very clear in expressing continued displeasure with the fact that their products are being used in this war context. And it's not totally clear how much of that flows from genuine moral anxiety and how much is about, you know, signaling to China and Russia that they're not - they may be being deployed in this way, but they're not thrilled about it. But it has created a situation where everyone is still a little bit walking on glass. The terms of the Pentagon deal, you know, are closely guarded. And because of the battlefield sensitivities, people are very quick to urge journalists and others not to talk about the specifics. But broadly speaking, there is still a lot of anxiety about Elon Musk's ability to - at least to some extent, curtail the services. MOSLEY: Our guest today is Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Ronan Farrow, talking about the growing sphere of Elon Musk's influence globally. We'll be right back. I'm Tonya Mosley, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BRAD MEHLDAU'S ""AFTER BACH: FLUX"") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Tonya Mosley. And our guest today is Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Ronan Farrow. He's written a new piece on Elon Musk's rise in power, his influence in public policy and in government relations. The piece is called ""Elon Musk's Shadow Rule"" and is published in this week's issue of The New Yorker. The sources you talk to on record also said - many of them - before they could agree to an interview with you, they first had to check in with Musk. We're not really talking about people who work for Elon Musk. These are independent folks or government officials. FARROW: That's all over the community of people around Elon Musk. Everyone from fellow tech moguls to people at his companies where it might be more expected - you get the same beholdenness (ph) to him. Even when it's private, outside people who have, you know, tremendous resources and power themselves, more than in virtually any reporting process I can think of, I got a lot of, if Elon is enthused, you know, I'll do what he wants. What you're referring to and what I was most struck by within that is that also, defense officials sometimes voiced those kinds of themes and suggested that kind of loyalty to him in a way I've never experienced reporting on national security issues. You know, when a reporter calls the Pentagon to ask questions about conversations strictly related to the war in Ukraine - right? - nothing of a personal nature here, to have those officials say, we're routing your questions through Elon, and we'll only talk if he wants us to - that's a pretty unusual courtesy to be providing a private citizen in response to questions about military and national security matters. MOSLEY: How did NASA become so reliant on SpaceX? FARROW: Well, it's a great illustration of some of the positive dimensions of Elon Musk's rise, right? He is someone who earnestly, I believe, identified areas in which the government just wasn't moving. And the space race is one of them. You know, access to space has tremendous implications for all of us. There's the obvious scientific ramifications of exploring the universe, but there's also national security objectives that are really immediate. You know, access to satellites, most of which are privately owned, determines our ability to surveil competitors on the world stage. It determines our ability to launch and control rockets and drones. It's really significant. And this was an area where we literally just ceded leadership. We weren't spending on this. We lost the ability to get people into space ourselves. We were sending them in Russian craft through Russian launches. That's a sad state of affairs and one that stands to damage the security of the American people. So it's not surprising that Elon Musk, who has been obsessed with Mars since his childhood and - was dismayed to look on the NASA website and find there's no real concerted plan that certainly that met Elon Musk's standards for speed and vigor to get human beings to Mars. So he really did come into a space of state under-investment and shake it up and reinvigorate the private space race. And the pace at which he moves, Tonya, including through Space X, is just very different from traditional, giant, hulking government contractors. You know, he is going to launch and blow up rockets at a pace that was unheard of previously and believes in iteration as a model for success. You know, you launch, and then you launch again, and you learn each time. And that's a very different philosophy from NASA's, which is, you know, all about really, really crossing every T and dotting every I. So a couple of things have played out in that relationship. I mean, one is NASA has been able to rely on Musk's growth in this area to get away from relying on the Russians, have American capacity again. That's really important. There's also been clashes with both NASA and the FAA about that speed-at-all-costs philosophy that Musk very often has. MOSLEY: You write that Musk has been successful because he seeks out business opportunities in these crucial areas where the state has essentially failed, which basically in turn makes governmental agencies reliant on him. We're talking NASA, the Department of Defense, the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. A source told you all of these agencies treat him like an unelected official. It is interesting that he's treated as an unelected official, but it seems murky, though, what side of the political aisle he's on. He has in the past identified as a centrist. Is that still the case? FARROW: This is why I include a discussion of Twitter and the acquisition of Twitter in this piece because while there has been a lot of discussion of the chaotic nature of his acquisition of Twitter and what he's done to shift its direction and upend its business model, I felt like I wanted to use it to elucidate something else, which was just Musk's politics themselves - you know, the fact that both his decision to purchase this company and the way in which he's run it seemed to be so entwined with a slate of political views that, for some people close to him, is unrecognizable even relative to the views he was expressing just a few years ago. MOSLEY: I mean, he uses Twitter, which has now rebranded as X, to say whatever is on his mind. You mention in your piece his tweets. For example, during the pandemic, he seemed to embrace COVID denialism. Have any high-ranking officials expressed concern with you about this behavior? FARROW: The portrait of Elon Musk as a person and as a personality that emerges in this piece is not a simple one. There's a kind of Twitter contingent that reacts to pieces of journalism by, like, whooping and hollering and delighting in the abstract idea that there is some kind of a takedown or something. But really, in my view, just reading my own work here, I don't personally take that away from this piece. You know, I think, if there is a villain in this piece, it's late-stage capitalism, right? It's the systems that allowed this kind of unrestrained power. Maybe, to an extent, it's the wan instruments of government, the areas of under-investment that Elon has come to fill, and much less so about him. That said, he's a great illustration of the perils of this dynamic because he has become so unpredictable and so given to chaotic excess in some of his decisions. And that's where, you know, Ukraine is a great example of what can result when that spirals. And we see that on Twitter in so many of his positions, where he's gone from describing himself as a centrist, even voting and donating to prominent Democrats just a few years ago, to really embracing alt-right vernacular and sentiment, becoming very anti-trans in some of his statements, very socially conservative to appearances. I think he views his stance on this as libertarian, as, you know, free speech-oriented, whatever the costs. But really, as you parse his views, there's a lot of alt-right in it to all appearances. And there's also a strain of misinformation in it, right? He's reposting conspiracy theories and falsehoods. And he's attacking people in a kind of trolly way, using alt-right-inflected broadsides. Like, this practice of accusing everyone of pedophilia all the time, even if there's no basis for it, is something that resonates deeply in that kind of QAnon-inflected community, right? These have become dog whistles in that world. And he spends a lot of time in that world. He's on alt-right podcasts. He is following accounts that espouse these views and this kind of misinformation. So that's the specific layer of concern about Elon that, you know, goes hand in hand with the concern of principle. MOSLEY: Is there the feeling that he's always been this way? You know, this persona that we see on Twitter that's being revealed and who he is as a businessperson, is there concern that he has changed over time? Or is this who he's always been? FARROW: I think in the view of most of the people in his life, Elon Musk is either changing or revealing a new side, or a new side is being accentuated in ways that are unfamiliar to those people. You know, the kinds of political views he's expressing now are in stark contrast to the ways he characterized his politics just a few years ago. The kind of vitriolic nature of his political tweets - I guess now we're supposed to call them Xes (laughter) - is something that is not familiar to a lot of people close to him. I think that this shift is down to a combination of factors, Tonya. You know, this is a person who is tremendously isolated by fame, by wealth. This isn't me editorializing. You know, he's talked about this openly, his loneliness, his sadness. There has been, you know, concern across his companies over recent years about his substance use. Tesla board members were concerned about his use of Ambien, which can cause hallucinations if you stay up on it. There's been reporting about his use of ketamine. And I do some more reporting on that in this piece. There are people around him who think or fear that that use is escalating in a way that might be to the point of excess. MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, my guest today is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ronan Farrow. He's written a new piece for The New Yorker about Elon Musk's rising influence on geopolitical relations. It's titled ""Elon Musk's Shadow Rule: How The U.S. Government Came To Rely On The Tech Billionaire - And Is Now Struggling To Rein Him In."" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JOHN COLTRANE QUARTET'S ""OUT OF THIS WORLD"") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. Today we're talking to Ronan Farrow, an investigative reporter and contributing writer to The New Yorker. His latest piece is titled ""Elon Musk's Shadow Rule."" I want to talk with you, Ronan, a little bit about the rebranding of Twitter to X. Quickly, though, can you explain his affinity for the letter X? FARROW: (Laughter). MOSLEY: I think it was referred to in the article as an obsession. FARROW: Yes. I mean, he has named products at his companies X. He has named multiple companies X over the course of his career. He has named at least one of his children X, followed by a long string of other characters. This is one of his children - the mother is the singer Grimes, who also now goes by lowercase C. And, you know, it's not totally clear why the obsession with X. The upshot of it is he keeps trying to revive that as a major brand in his pantheon of companies, and Twitter is the latest attempt to do that. MOSLEY: Let's talk about that for a little bit, because what are his intentions for the site? What does he want to turn X into? FARROW: Right. So I think that there are two goals that sit uneasily together. One is a continuation of this career-long quest to build a banking app, an online bank. That was the initial goal of x.com, this company that in the end became PayPal after a merger. That also is connected to a desire to build an everything app. And we see those two things together in the Asian market, where apps like WeChat have become very, very popular. And they incorporate, you know, a payment system. So it's a commerce platform, but also it's a messaging app. You know, you can pay your bills there. It's - like, it is kind of an everything app. This has never taken off in the Western market. Musk seems very, very bent on trying to do that. That's obviously a very different goal from Twitter - right? - which was so discourse-focused. So it makes you wonder, why acquire the company and rebrand it and try to turn it into this totally different thing at all? I think the answer lies in the second goal that sits uneasily alongside that careerlong, pragmatic business goal, which appears to be more ideological. He wants to dominate the discourse in addition to all these other fields. He wants a platform where he can control the town square and to bring to it these sensibilities we're talking about, to respond to his frustrations with the liberal, woke intelligentsia, as he perceives it, that has been unkind to him, by building a discourse that counterbalances that. And, you know, you see him withdrawing in all sorts of ways into that thinking. There are multiple reporters that he has kind of lashed out at or retaliated against. I should point out, as of now, this piece has been out for more than 24 hours. He hasn't done that to me. MOSLEY: You haven't heard from them yet. FARROW: So that - right. So that is an important distinction to draw. I'm not saying that's happened in my experience, but it has happened in other cases with other journalists. And, you know, at the same time, you see him engaging more and more on platforms that are exclusively alt-right in their sensibility. MOSLEY: You know, Ronan, as part of your reporting, you touch on all of Elon Musk's business ventures and how it intersects with government relations. As part of your reporting, you also tried to get into the making of a man. You go back to his childhood. You talk with folks who know him intimately. Then there is this other growing piece of the puzzle that we talk about, and that's around artificial intelligence. And you actually end your article talking about where Musk sits in the race to be the most powerful in the space of artificial intelligence. We know that he's been involved in the technology for several years with OpenAI, for example. But where does he sit in this space now? And what is the biggest concern that you have around it in your reporting? FARROW: As you point out, he has a background in this field. He was one of the early supporters of OpenAI and put money into that enterprise. It has now become a significant force in the world of AI. He had a falling out with his colleagues at OpenAI and walked away from that. The other leaders in the AI field are now watching him re-approach this market. He has talked a lot about how he believes passionately that artificial intelligence presents dangers to us all and, I believe, sincerely evinced that conviction in a group letter where he got a lot of tech titans to sign on to a public statement saying, you know, there should be a pause in the development of advanced artificial intelligence while we figure out the ethical ramifications and the ways in which this might lead to the human species being replaced. And at the same time, he was pursuing building his own company and his own new entry into the field. While there was this period of a pause that he had signed on to this public request for, he was sourcing components needed for the R&D. He was doing hiring. He was signing the paperwork. And, you know, there are some pretty big names in tech who are on the record in this piece, including Reid Hoffman, who was another early supporter of OpenAI, who talks about how having someone who, at least in part, seems to be motivated by competition to come to this field - and that does seem to be the case. You know, Elon Musk has talked about his new initiative in this field, a company called xAI, in terms that are almost purely rooted in competition. You know, he says, well, I'm a third player in this space and I'm coming to it late. But, you know, hopefully this third option can do more good than harm. What Hoffman points out, which I thought was very astute, is a dimension that's unique to this forward-looking field is the way in which we are creating a new power and intelligence in our own image. And we've already seen, in early chatbot technology, how quickly those chatbots become racist and sexist. So, you know, we see the way in which the choice of creator can be important to the outcome of the technology. And, you know, what Reid says on the record in this piece is we need to be careful about messianic people shaping what the future of AI looks like. MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, my guest today is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ronan Farrow. He's written a new piece for The New Yorker about Elon Musk's rising influence on geopolitical relations. It's titled ""Elon Musk's Shadow Rule: How The U.S. Government Came To Rely On The Tech Billionaire And Is Now Struggling To Rein Him In."" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF HOLT VAUGHN'S ""BITTER SUITE"") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. Today we're talking to Ronan Farrow, an investigative reporter and contributing writer to The New Yorker. His latest piece is titled ""Elon Musk's Shadow Rule."" Ronan, what is the takeaway to this piece, this big, ambitious piece? Is there a way to rein in Musk and what is the ultimate fear if he's not? FARROW: I think the big takeaway is not so much about Musk, but about the systems around him and the economy and political landscape that we have built that puts so much unrestrained power into the hands of so few hyper-wealthy individuals. And, you know, Elon Musk is behaving like Elon Musk, right? There are certainly specific measures that can be taken to ameliorate some of the problems that people talk about in this piece. You know, Musk's peers in Silicon Valley still do - to some extent, anyway - have his ear. Musk's investors and shareholders can hold the reins even if the government has struggled to. Consumers even, in a more attenuated way, can make decisions about whether they're using his products or not. I think that the harder problem is not Elon Musk, it's the universe of state underinvestment and diminishing trust in institutions that has allowed the Elon Musk that we've been talking about today to flourish. And that's one of those frustrating, big-picture problems where what it's going to take is fundamental political reform and, you know, voters on a massive scale realizing that this kind of unrestrained private power, while it has many benefits, also carries significant risks. You know, one comment that stayed with me, Tonya, in the course of this reporting was there's a guy named Jim Bridenstine on the record in this piece. He's a former NASA administrator. And he's actually a Trump appointee and a really hard right former congressperson. And I highlight that political orientation because I think it makes the argument he made particularly valuable. You know, he talked about, despite his general sort of free market disposition, fearing a world in which deregulation is a bigger danger than regulation. You know, Musk talks a lot about the evils of regulation, the ways in which it can stymie progress and innovation. And for sure, there are valid points in that argument. But what Bridenstine pointed out, which I liked coming from a conservative voice, was that he said, you know, despite the fact that I am in general a free market guy, I really want to highlight the perils of too (inaudible) regulation. You know, Elon Musk talks a lot about the evils of regulation, the ways in which government regulation can stymie progress and innovation. And for sure, there's a lot of truth in that. But what Bridenstine talks about is equally important here, which is having the guardrails off completely, having an absence of the services governments provide to keep us all safe can present even more danger. And, you know, he makes the comparison to the recent Titanic submersible implosion. And without talking about Musk specifically says, you know, look, if we concentrate too much power in the hands of private individuals and companies, we're going to see more of that. It opens the door to tragedy potentially, eventually on a much larger scale than that submersible. MOSLEY: Ronan Farrow, thank you so much for this illuminating piece. FARROW: Thank you very much for a thoughtful conversation about it. I really appreciate it, Tonya. MOSLEY: Ronan Farrow is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.

Technical Consultant at Kimm Technology Economics Rwanda's land mass area is relatively small (<27,000 km²) and has fairly high pop densities that would make terrestrial solutions viable in every part of the country. Serving on satellite is hyped and an overkill.
A fiber solution that is complemented with highly efficient FWA on last mile would deliver the same and beyond at less than half the cost of satellite - it would translate to tonnes of cost savings on the commonwealth of Rwanda.

Elon Reeve Musk, FRS (Pretoria, 1971. június 28. –) dél-afrikai származású amerikai mérnök, tervező, feltaláló, közgazdász, vállalkozó, cégalapító, befektető, filantróp,[20] a világ leggazdagabb embere.[21] A Surrey University díszdoktora.[22][23] Nevéhez fűződnek a Zip2, az X.com, a PayPal, a SpaceX, a Tesla Inc., a SolarCity, a The Boring Company, a Neuralink vállalkozások, továbbá a Starlink projekt és a Hyperloop megtervezése.[24] 
2021 januárjában a Bloomberg közzé tette, hogy a Muskhoz köthető vállalatok piaci értéke szerint – a Tesla részvényeinek ára rekord magasra emelkedett, így a vállalat tőzsdei értéke első alkalommal meghaladta a Facebook értékét[25] – Elon Musk vagyona elérte a 188 milliárd amerikai dollárt, így ő vált a világ leggazdagabb emberévé,[26] a 2021-es év januárját tekintve. 
2021-ben a Time magazin az Év Emberének választotta.[27][28] 2022-ben 44 milliárd dollárért felvásárolta a Twittert és október 27-től annak vezérigazgatója.[29] 
Anyai nagyapja, dr. Joshua Haldeman amerikai származású kanadai volt, míg apai nagyanyja brit és pennsylvaniai felmenőkkel bírt. Szülőhazájából, a Dél-afrikai Köztársaságból 17 évesen Kanadába vándorolt, mert az Egyesült Államokba szeretett volna emigrálni, de csak Kanadában kapta meg az állampolgárságot. Fizikát és közgazdaságtant tanult az egyetemen, majd két diploma megszerzése után otthagyta Kanadát, és az USA-ba költözött. A kaliforniai Stanford Egyetemre felvételizett, ám szinte azonnal, két nap múlva ott is hagyta. Állítása szerint azért, „hogy fontosabb problémákkal foglalkozzon, amelyek befolyásolják az emberiség jövőjét”. 
Első jelentősebb üzleti fogása a Blastar nevű játékprogram[30] eladása volt, melyet 12 évesen írt meg. Ezért a programért összesen 500 amerikai dollárt kapott.[31] Öccsével, Kimbal Muskkal 1995-ben megalapította a Zip2 nevű internetes vállalatot. Ezt 1999-ben 341 millió dollárért eladta a Compaqnak. 
A pénzt az X.com megalakításába fektette. A cég néhány évvel később egyesült a Confinity vállalattal,[32] s így létrejött a PayPal, amely pár év múlva az internet egyik meghatározó szolgáltatása lett. Az eBay 1,5 milliárd dollárért vásárolta fel a céget 2002 októberében.[33] 
Ezután Musk 2002-ben megalapította a SpaceX céget, azzal a céllal, hogy forradalmasítsa az űrrepülést, megkönnyítse az űr elérését, és lehetővé tegye, hogy az emberi társadalom több bolygón is megvesse a lábát. Célja az volt, hogy önerőből fejlesszen ki egy űrkapszulát, mely később akár embereket is szállíthat a Nemzetközi Űrállomásra. A kapszula fejlesztése közel tíz évig tartott, de végül sikerrel járt. A Dragon űrhajó sikeresen Föld körüli pályára állt, majd 2012-ben hozzákapcsolódott a Nemzetközi Űrállomáshoz, 2020-ban pedig már két űrhajóst szállított az űrállomásra.[34] 
A SpaceX – amelynek tulajdonosa és fejlesztési főmérnöke Elon Musk – elsőként fejlesztett ki visszatérő, így többször is felhasználható hordozórakétát, a Falcon 9-et, ezzel drasztikusan lecsökkenteve a Föld körüli pályára állítás költségét. A költséghatékony pályára állítás előnyére alapozva indította el Musk a Starlink projektjét, amelynek célja lehetővé tenni a globális internetelérést, a bolygó teljes felszínén történő internetszolgáltatást. 
2004-ben 6,5 millió dollárt fektetett magánvagyonából a Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning és Ian Wright által 2003-ban alapított Tesla Motors autógyártó startupba, mely elektromos autókat fejleszt és gyárt, illetve a töltésükhöz szükséges töltőhálózatot építi ki. A cégalapítók sok más befektetőt is megkerestek, de csak Musk látott elég fantáziát a cég víziójában, amelynek fő céljával – az amerikai olajfüggőség csökkentése – maga is egyetértett. Befektetésével Musk a cég fő részvényese, és a vállalat elnöke lett, a következő években még több tízmillió dollárt fektetett a vállalat beindításába. A cég tíz év alatt több sorozatgyártásban készülő modellt dobott piacra. 
2013-ban a Hyperloop nevű tervével került a figyelem középpontjába, ugyanis kijelentette, hogy forradalmasítani tudná a szárazföldi tömegközlekedést. Későbbi tervei között szerepel egy Mars-utazás magántőkéből és egy hatékonyabb meghajtás megvalósítása az űrhajók számára.[35] A projekt részeként 2018. február 6-án kilövésre került a Falcon Heavy – hatvan tonnányi hasznos teher űrbe juttatására alkalmas – hordozórakéta-komplexumának kísérleti példánya. A rakéta Musk Space-X start up vállalkozásának része volt és az első általa szállított teher egy meggypiros Tesla Roadster volt. Elon Musk Tesla Roadstere száz kilométer magasság fölött kinyíló burkolat alól bukkant ki, a kocsi volánjánál a Starman elnevezésű bábu abba a szkafanderbe volt öltöztetve, amit 2020-ban már a SpaceX Crew Dragon űrhajójának utasai viseltek, amikor a Nemzetközi Űrállomásra repültek. A műszerfalon pedig a Galaxis útikalauz stopposoknakból ismert, a címszereplő könyv borítóján található „Don’t Panic!” („Ne ess pánikba!”) volt olvasható.[36][37] 
2021 januárjára Musk vagyona 163,7 milliárd dollárra csökkent, ezzel a világ 2. leggazdagabb embere lett.[38] 
Elon Reeve Musk 1971. június 28-án született a Dél-afrikai Köztársaság egyik fővárosában, Pretoriában.[39][40] Musk brit és pennsylvaniai holland felmenőkkel rendelkezik.[41][42] Édesanyja Maye Musk (született Haldeman) modell és dietetikus, aki a kanadai Saskatchewanban született és Dél-Afrikában nőtt fel.[43][44][45] Édesapja, Errol Musk dél-afrikai elektromechanikus mérnök, pilóta, tengerész, tanácsadó és ingatlanfejlesztő, aki egy Tanganyika-tó melletti zambiai smaragdbánya féltulajdonosa volt.[46][47][48][49] Musknak van egy öccse, Kimbal, és egy húga, Tosca.[45][50] 
Musk családja fiatalkorában jómódú volt.[49] Apját az apartheid-ellenes Progresszív Párt képviselőjeként beválasztották a pretoriai városi tanácsba, gyermekei osztoztak apjuk apartheid-ellenességében.[39] Anyai nagyapja, Joshua Haldeman kalandvágyó, amerikai születésű kanadai volt, aki egy egymotoros Bellanca repülőgéppel rekordokat döntögető utakra vitte családját Afrikába és Ausztráliába.[51][52][53] 
Miután szülei 1980-ban elváltak, Musk úgy döntött, hogy többnyire az apjával él.[41] Musk megbánta döntését, és elhidegült az apjától.[54] Van egy apai féltestvére és egy féltestvére.[51][55] 
Ashlee Vance Muskról írt életrajzában Muskot esetlen és introvertált gyerekként írta le.[56] Tízéves korában Musk érdeklődést mutatott a számítástechnika és a videojátékok iránt, és a VIC-20 használati utasításából tanította magát programozni.[57] Tizenkét évesen eladta BASIC-alapú játékát, a Blastart a PC and Office Technology magazinnak körülbelül 500 dollárért.[58][59] 
Musk a Waterkloof House Preparatory Schoolba, a Bryanston High Schoolba és a Pretoria Boys High Schoolba járt, ahol leérettségizett.[60] Musk kanadai anyja révén kanadai útlevelet kért,[61][62] mivel tudta, hogy így könnyebb lesz az Amerikai Egyesült Államokba bevándorolni.[63] Amíg kérelmének elbírálására várt, öt hónapig a Pretoria Egyetemre járt.[64] 
Musk 1989 júniusában érkezett Kanadába, és egy évig egy másod-unokatestvérénél élt Saskatchewanban,[65] alkalmi munkákat végzett egy farmon és egy fűrészüzemben.[66] 1990-ben beiratkozott a Queen's Universityre az Ontario állambeli Kingstonban.[67][68] Két évvel később átiratkozott a Pennsylvaniai Egyetemre, ahol 1995-ben a Wharton Schoolban fizikából Bachelor of Arts és közgazdaságtanból Bachelor of Science fokozatot szerzett.[69][70][71][72] Állítólag nagyszabású, belépőjegyes házibulikat rendezett, hogy segítse a tandíj kifizetését, és üzleti tervet írt egy, a Google Bookshoz hasonló elektronikus könyvszkennelési szolgáltatásra.[73] 
1994-ben Musk két gyakornoki állást töltött a Szilícium-völgyben: az egyiket a Pinnacle Research Institute nevű energiatároló startupnál, amely elektrolitikus ultrakondenzátorokat vizsgált energiatárolásra, a másikat pedig a Palo Alto-i Rocket Science Games nevű startupnál.[74][75] 1995-ben felvételt nyert a Stanford Egyetem anyagtudományi PhD programjába..[76][77] Musk azonban úgy döntött, hogy csatlakozik az internet boomjához, ehelyett két nappal a felvételi után visszalépett, és jelentkezett a Netscape-nél, amire állítólag soha nem kapott választ.[61][78] 
Musk egyetemi évei alatt ismerkedett össze a kanadai származású Justine Wilsonnal, akivel 2000-ben házasodtak össze, de néhány évvel később, 2008-ban elváltak. Első gyermekük bölcsőhalálban életét vesztette. Később 5 fiuk született, kettes és hármas ikrek. Fia 2022 nyarán jelentette be, hogy nemet és nevet vált: Xavier Alexander Musk új nevén Vivian Jenna Wilson.[79][80] 
2008-ban egy klubban találkozott először Talulah Riley angol színésznővel, akivel 2010-ben keltek egybe. 2012-ben elváltak, majd 2013-ban újra megházasodtak, és 2014-ben másodjára is elváltak. 
2018-ban online ismerkedett össze Grimesszel, miután Musk talált egy viccet a mesterséges intelligenciáról, melyet az énekes tett közzé a Twitter-oldalán. 2020 májusában megszületett első közös gyermekük, akinek az ""X Æ A-12"" nevet adták, de a név a kaliforniai törvényekbe ütközött, így ""X Æ A-Xii"" névre változtatták át, ahol az ""X"" a keresztneve és ""Æ A-II"" a vezetékneve. 
1995-ben Musk, testvére, Kimbal és Greg Kouri megalapította a Zip2-t.[81][82] Errol Musk 28 000 dollárral támogatta őket.[83] A cég egy internetes városkalauzt fejlesztett ki térképekkel, útbaigazítással és sárga oldalakkal, és újságok számára értékesítették.[84] Egy kis bérelt irodában dolgoztak Palo Altóban,[32] Musk minden este kódolta a weboldalt.[32] Végül a Zip2 szerződést kötött a The New York Times-szal és a Chicago Tribune-nal.[73] A testvérek meggyőzték az igazgatótanácsot, hogy mondjanak le a CitySearch-csel való egyesülésről;[85] Musk próbálkozásai, hogy vezérigazgató legyen, azonban meghiúsultak.[86] 1999 februárjában a Compaq 307 millió dollárért készpénzben felvásárolta a Zip2-t,[87][88] Musk pedig 22 millió dollárt kapott a 7 százalékos részesedéséért.[89] 
2018-ban Muskot beperelte a SEC egy tweet miatt, amelyben azt állította, hogy a Tesla potenciális magánkézbe vételéhez biztosították a finanszírozást.[90][a] A per hamisnak, félrevezetőnek és a befektetőkre nézve károsnak minősítette a tweetet, és arra törekedett, hogy Muskot eltiltják a tőzsdén jegyzett vállalatok vezérigazgatói tisztségétől.[90][94][95] Két nappal később Musk megegyezett a SEC-vel, anélkül, hogy elismerte vagy tagadta volna a SEC állításait. Ennek eredményeként Muskot és a Teslát egyenként 20 millió dollárra büntették, Musk pedig három évre le kellett mondjon a Tesla elnöki posztjáról, de vezérigazgató maradhatott.[96] Musk interjúkban kijelentette, hogy nem bánta meg a SEC vizsgálatot kiváltó tweet közzétételét.[97][98] 2022 áprilisában egy részvényes, aki több Tesla részvényessel együtt beperelte Muskot a tweet miatt, azt mondta, hogy egy szövetségi bíró úgy döntött, hogy a tweet hamis volt, bár a szóban forgó ítéletet nem hozták nyilvánosságra.[99] 
2019-ben Musk egy tweetben azt állította, hogy a Tesla félmillió autót fog gyártani abban az évben.[100] 2019-ben a SEC bírósági beadvánnyal reagált Musk tweetjére, kérve a bíróságot, hogy tartsa őt szemrehányásban, amiért egy ilyen tweet-tel megsértette egy egyezségi megállapodás feltételeit; a vádat Musk vitatta. Ezt végül Musk és a SEC közötti közös megállapodással rendezték, amely tisztázta a korábbi megállapodás részleteit.[101] A megállapodás tartalmazott egy listát azokról a témákról, amelyekről való tweetelés előtt Musknak előzetes engedélyt kell kérnie.[102] 2020-ban egy bíró megakadályozta egy olyan per lefolytatását, amely szerint Musk egy, a Tesla részvényárfolyamára (""túl magas imo"") vonatkozó tweetje megsértette a megállapodást.[103][104] A FOIA által közzétett feljegyzésekből kiderült, hogy maga a SEC is arra a következtetésre jutott, hogy Musk ezt követően kétszer is megsértette a megállapodást, amikor ""a Tesla napelemtető gyártási volumenére és a részvényárfolyamára"" vonatkozó tweetet írt.[105] 
Musk már 2017-ben kifejezte érdeklődését a Twitter megvásárlása iránt,[106] és korábban megkérdőjelezte a platform szólásszabadság melletti elkötelezettségét.[107][108] 2022 januárjában Musk elkezdett Twitter-részvényeket vásárolni, és áprilisra elérte a 9,2%-os részesedést, amivel ő lett a legnagyobb részvényes.[109] making him the largest shareholder.[110][b] Amikor ezt nyilvánosan nyilvánosságra hozták, a Twitter részvényei a legnagyobb napon belüli árfolyam-emelkedést élték át a vállalat 2013-as tőzsdei bevezetése óta.[112] Április 4-én Musk beleegyezett egy olyan megállapodásba, amely őt nevezi ki a Twitter igazgatótanácsába, és megtiltja neki, hogy 14,9%-nál nagyobb részesedést szerezzen a vállalatban.[113][114] Április 13-án azonban Musk 43 milliárd dolláros ajánlatot tett a Twitter megvásárlására, és vételi ajánlatot tett a Twitter részvényeinek 100%-ára részvényenként 54,20 dollárért.[110][115] Válaszul a Twitter igazgatótanácsa elfogadott egy ""mérgező pirula"" részvényesi jogokról szóló tervet, amely megakadályozza, hogy egyetlen befektetőnek is 15%-nál nagyobb részesedése legyen a vállalatban az igazgatótanács jóváhagyása nélkül.[116] Ennek ellenére a hónap végére Musk sikeresen lezárta ajánlatát mintegy 44 milliárd dollárért,[117] ami körülbelül 12,5 milliárd dollárnyi, a Tesla részvényei ellenében felvett kölcsönt és 21 milliárd dollárnyi tőkefinanszírozást tartalmazott.[118][119] 
A Tesla tőzsdei értéke az üzletre reagálva másnap több mint 100 milliárd dollárral zuhant, aminek következtében Musk körülbelül 30 milliárd dollárt veszített nettó vagyonából..[120][121] Ezt követően 86 millió követőjének tweetelt kritikát a Twitter vezetője, Vijaya Gadde politikájáról, ami miatt néhányan közülük szexista és rasszista zaklatást indítottak ellene.[122] Pontosan egy hónappal a felvásárlás bejelentése után Musk kijelentette, hogy az ügyletet ""felfüggesztették"", miután egy jelentés szerint a Twitter napi aktív felhasználóinak 5%-a spam fiók volt,[123] aminek következtében a Twitter részvényei több mint 10%-ot estek.[124] Bár kezdetben megerősítette elkötelezettségét a felvásárlás mellett,[125] júliusban értesítést küldött az üzlet felmondásáról; a Twitter igazgatótanácsa azt válaszolta, hogy elkötelezettek a tranzakció betartása mellett.[126] 2022. július 12-én a Twitter hivatalosan beperelte Muskot a delaware-i Chancery Court of Delaware bíróságon a Twitter megvásárlására vonatkozó jogilag kötelező érvényű megállapodás megszegése miatt.[127] 2022 októberében Musk ismét megfordult, és részvényenként 54,20 dollárért ajánlotta fel a Twitter megvásárlását. A felvásárlás október 27-én hivatalosan is lezárult.[128] A Twitter megvásárlását hivatalosan október 27-én hajtották végre.[129] 
Közvetlenül a felvásárlás után Musk kirúgta a Twitter felső vezetőit, például Parag Agrawal vezérigazgatót,[129][130] akit leváltott,[131] bevezette a havi 7,99 dolláros ""kék pipa"" előfizetést,[132][133][134] és elbocsátotta a vállalat személyzetének jelentős részét.[135][136] Musk csökkentette a tartalom moderálását,[137] és decemberben Musk belső dokumentumokat hozott nyilvánosságra, amelyek Hunter Biden laptopjának Twitter általi moderálásával kapcsolatosak a 2020-as elnökválasztás előtti időszakban.[138] A Southern Poverty Law Center megjegyezte, hogy a Twitter számos szélsőséges személyt ellenőrzött.[139] A felvásárlást követő több millió tweetet vizsgáló tanulmány szerint a gyűlöletbeszéd a platformon ""láthatóbbá vált"" Musk vezetése alatt.[140] 
Tulajdonlásának első heteiben Musk egy sor rövid életű döntést és változtatást hozott, amelyeket gyorsan visszafordított, többek között bevezette a fizetős kék pipát,[141] létrehozta a ""hivatalos"" címkét[142] és megtiltotta a más közösségi médiaplatformokon lévő profilokra való hivatkozást.[143] Musk irányítása alatt a Twitteren több nagyszabású leállás történt.[144][145] 
2022 áprilisában a The Washington Post arról számolt be, hogy Musk magánjelleggel azt állította, hogy a feltételezett cenzúra a platformon, beleértve az olyan fiókok betiltását, mint a The Babylon Bee, késztette őt a felvásárlás megkezdésére. A felvásárlást követően azonnali prioritássá tette a The Bee-hez hasonló fiókok visszaállítását.[146] A The New York Post felfedte, hogy Musk volt felesége, Talulah Riley bátorította Muskot a Twitter megvásárlására, kifejezetten a The Bee betiltására hivatkozva.[147] 
December 18-án Musk egy szavazást tett közzé Twitter-fiókján, amelyben arra kérte a felhasználókat, hogy döntsék el, lemondjon-e a Twitter éléről, a több mint 17,5 millió szavazatból 57,5% támogatta ezt a döntést,[148] majd Musk bejelentette, hogy lemond vezérigazgatói posztjáról, ""amint találok valakit, aki elég bolond ahhoz, hogy elvállalja a munkát"".[149] 
2023. május 12-én Musk bejelentette, hogy lemond a vezérigazgatói pozícióról, és helyette ""exec chair & CTO, felügyeli a terméket, a szoftvert és a sysops-ot"". Bejelentette továbbá, hogy új vezérigazgatót nevez ki, az NBCUniversal korábbi vezetőjét, Linda Yaccarinót.[150][151] 
Gyakran nevezik úgy is, mint az Igazi Vasember, ugyanis több vonásban is nagyon hasonlít a képregényszereplőre: milliárdos, feltaláló és több meghökkentő üzleti vállalkozást is sikerre vitt.[35] Sőt mi több, a Vasember 2. című filmben cameoszerepben (mint önmaga, Elon Musk) fel is tűnik, kezet fog Tony Starkkal, és megemlíti, hogy van egy elektromos repülővel kapcsolatos ötlete. 
A Tesla modelljeinek sorozata Elon Musk terve szerint a SEXY szót adta volna ki, azonban a „Model E” neve ""Model 3"" lett, mert azt a nevet a Ford korábban bejegyeztette.[152] 
Elon Musk Tesla Roadstere a Tesla, Inc. (korábban Tesla Motors) első generációs elektromos meghajtású gépkocsija, amelyet 2018. február 6-án a Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) cég Falcon Heavy rakétájával fellőttek a világűrbe. A SpaceX alapítójának, Elon Musknak sportkocsijában az űrruhába öltöztetett Starman nevű bábu ült. A hangszórókból David Bowie Life on Mars? című száma szólt. A központi kijelző helyén, a legfeltűnőbb helyen pedig a ""Don't Panic"", (Ne ess pánikba!) felirat foglal helyet. Elon Musk fiatalkora óta rajong a Galaxis útikalauz stopposoknak című regénysorozatért. A könyvborítón szerepel a ""Don't Panic!"" felirat, ami végül az autó műszerfalára került.[153] 
2018 júliusában a thaiföldi barlangszerencsétlenség[154] áldozatainak egy mentőkapszulát tervezett, amely a föld alatt rekedt 12 fős focicsapatot és edzőjüket hivatott a felszínre hozni.[155] A kapszula július 8-ra rekordsebességgel el is készült, a helyszínre szállították, de az idő rövidsége és az esőzés miatti nagy veszély, valamint a thai hatóságok mentési kísérletekre való sürgetése miatt nem vetették be. A kapszula története azonban ezzel nem ért véget. A mentőcsapat vezetője nem fogadta el Elon Musk felajánlását és hamarosan vita keletkezett közöttük, arra nézve, hogy a kapszula alkalmas-e vagy sem a mentésre. Miután Musk mérgében egy twitter bejegyzésben ""lepedofilozta"" a búvárt, az újságok az egész akciót PR-tevékenységnek minősítették. A dolgon az sem segített, hogy Musk később bocsánatot kért hirtelen megjegyzése miatt Narongszak Oszotthakorntól.[156] 
A kicsiny gyermekmentésre alkalmas tengeralattjáró – amelybe akár egy felnőtt ember is belefér – a The Boring Company csúcstechnológiájával és a SpaceX mérnökeinek tudása által készült el két nap alatt. Alkalmas mélyebb vizű tengeri barlangokban felhasználni mentés céljára, de Elon Musk a kapszula továbbfejlesztett változatát akár az űrben is el tudná képzelni. Végül a mini tengeralattjárót Musk a helyieknek adományozta azzal, hogy egy esetlegesen előforduló újabb katasztrófánál felhasználhatják.[157] 
Muskot kritizálták a Covid19-világjárvánnyal kapcsolatos nyilvános megjegyzései és magatartása miatt.[158][159] Téves információkat terjesztett a vírusról, többek között népszerűsített egy széles körben diszkreditált tanulmányt a klorokin előnyeiről, és azt állította, hogy a Covid19-halálozási statisztikák felfújtak.[160] 
2020 márciusában Musk kijelentette: ""A koronavírus-pánik butaság.""[161][162] A Tesla alkalmazottainak küldött e-mailben Musk a Covid19-et a ""nátha egy speciális formájának"" nevezte, és azt jósolta, hogy a megerősített Covid19-es esetek nem fogják meghaladni az amerikai lakosság 0,1%-át.[158] 2020. március 19-én Musk azt jósolta, hogy április végére ""valószínűleg közel nulla új eset lesz [az USA-ban].""[159] A Politico ezt a kijelentést az egyik ""legmerészebb, legmagabiztosabb és leglátványosabban téves előrejelzésnek [2020-ra]"" nevezte.[163] Musk azt is tévesen állította, hogy a gyerekek ""lényegében immunisak"" a Covid19-re.[164][165] 
Musk elítélte a Covid19-zárlatokat, és kezdetben nem volt hajlandó bezárni a Tesla Fremont Factoryt 2020 márciusában, dacolva a helyi maradj otthon-paranccsal.[158][166][167] 2020 májusában újra megnyitotta a Tesla gyárat, dacolva a helyi óvóhely-paranccsal,[168][169] és figyelmeztette a dolgozókat, hogy ha nem jelentkeznek munkába, fizetés nélkül maradnak, és veszélybe kerülhet a munkanélküli segélyük.[169] 
2020 márciusában Musk megígérte, hogy a Tesla lélegeztetőgépeket készít a Covid19-betegek számára, ha hiány lépne fel.[170] Miután olyan személyiségek, mint Bill de Blasio, New York polgármestere reagált Musk ajánlatára,[171] Musk felajánlotta, hogy lélegeztetőgépeket adományoz, amelyeket a Tesla megépítene vagy megvásárolna egy harmadik féltől.[170] Musk azonban végül BiPAP és CPAP gépeket vásárolt és adományozott, amelyek nem invazív lélegeztetőgépek, a sokkal drágább és keresettebb invazív mechanikus lélegeztetőgépek helyett.[172][173] 
2020 szeptemberében Musk kijelentette, hogy nem kapja meg a Covid19-vakcinát, mert ő és gyermekei ""nem veszélyeztetettek a Covid19-re"".[174][175] Két hónappal később Musk elkapta a Covid19-et, és azt sugallta, hogy a Covid19 gyors antigénteszt eredményei kétesek, ami után a ""Space Karen"" kifejezés volt trendi a Twitteren, Muskra utalva.[176][177] 2021 decemberében azonban Musk felfedte, hogy ő és a jogosult gyermekei megkapták a vakcinát.[178] 
Musk szerint az amerikai kormánynak nem kellene támogatásokat nyújtania a vállalatoknak, hanem szén-dioxid-adót kellene kivetnie a rossz viselkedés visszaszorítására.[179][180] Szerinte a szabad piac érné el a legjobb megoldást, és a környezetszennyező járművek gyártásának következményei kellene, hogy legyenek.[181] A Tesla több milliárd dollárnyi támogatást kapott.[182] Emellett a Tesla nagy összegeket keresett a Kaliforniában és az Egyesült Államokban szövetségi szinten kínált, kormányok által kezdeményezett nulla kibocsátású kreditrendszerekből, ami megkönnyítette a Tesla járművek kezdeti fogyasztói elfogadását, mivel a kormányok által nyújtott adókedvezmények lehetővé tették, hogy a Tesla akkumulátoros elektromos járművei árban versenyképesek legyenek a meglévő, alacsonyabb árú, belső égésű motoros járművekkel szemben.[183] Nevezetesen, a Tesla bevételeinek egy részét az Európai Unió kibocsátáskereskedelmi rendszere és a kínai nemzeti szén-dioxid-kereskedelmi rendszer által a vállalatnak nyújtott szén-dioxid-kreditek értékesítéséből szerzi.[184][185][186][187] 
Musk, aki régóta ellenzi a short-értékesítést, többször is kritizálta a gyakorlatot, és amellett érvelt, hogy annak illegálisnak kellene lennie.[188][189] A Wired magazin úgy vélte, hogy Musk ellenállása a short-értékesítéssel szemben abból ered, hogy a short-értékesítők arra ösztönzik, hogy kedvezőtlen információkat találjanak és népszerűsítsenek a cégeiről.[190] 2021 elején bátorította a GameStop short squeeze-t.[191][192] 
Musk népszerűsítette a kriptovalutákat és támogatja őket a hagyományos, kormány által kibocsátott fiat valutákkal szemben.[193] Tekintettel Musk tweetjeinek befolyására a kriptovaluták piacainak mozgatásában,[194] a kriptovalutákkal kapcsolatos kijelentéseit egyesek, például Nouriel Roubini közgazdász, piaci manipulációnak tekintették.[195] Musk közösségi médiában tett Bitcoin és Dogecoin dicsérő szavait a Bitcoin és a Dogecoin árfolyamának növelésének tulajdonították. Ennek következtében kérdéseket vetett fel a Tesla 2021-es bejelentése, amely Musk közösségi médiában tanúsított viselkedésének hátterében állt, miszerint 1,5 milliárd dollár értékben vásárolt Bitcoint.[196] A Tesla bejelentését, miszerint elfogadja a Bitcoint fizetésre, a környezetvédők és a befektetők kritizálták a kriptopénz-bányászat környezeti hatásai miatt. Néhány hónappal később a kritikákra reagálva Musk a Twitteren bejelentette, hogy a Tesla nem fogad el többé Bitcoinban történő fizetést, és nem vesz részt Bitcoin tranzakciókban, amíg a környezetvédelmi problémák nem oldódnak meg.[197][198] 
Annak ellenére, hogy a The Boring Company részt vesz a tömegközlekedési infrastruktúra kiépítésében, Musk kritizálta a tömegközlekedést, és az individualizált közlekedést (magánautók) népszerűsítette.[199][200][201] Kommentárjait ""elitistának"" nevezték, és széleskörű kritikát váltott ki mind közlekedési, mind várostervezési szakértőkből, akik rámutattak, hogy a tömegközlekedés a sűrű városi területeken gazdaságosabb, energiatakarékosabb és sokkal kevesebb helyet igényel, mint a magánautók.[200][201][202]

Elon Reeve Musk (wym. /ˈi:lɒn ˈmʌsk/; ur. 28 czerwca 1971 w Pretorii[4]) – przedsiębiorca, założyciel lub współzałożyciel przedsiębiorstw PayPal, SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink i Boring Company[5]. Pochodzi z Południowej Afryki, mieszka i pracuje w Stanach Zjednoczonych (posiada obywatelstwo południowoafrykańskie, kanadyjskie oraz amerykańskie). Dyrektor generalny i techniczny w SpaceX, dyrektor generalny i główny architekt w Tesla Inc. W styczniu 2021 został uznany najbogatszym człowiekiem świata przez magazyn „Forbes” i agencję Bloomberg[6][7]. Od października 2022 właściciel serwisu X (Twittera). 
Pochodzi z Południowej Afryki[8]. Urodził się i wychował w stołecznej Pretorii w mieszanej narodowościowo białej rodzinie. Jego ojciec, inżynier Errol Musk, jest rodowitym Afrykanerem, natomiast matka, modelka i dietetyczka Maye Musk jest Południowoafrykanką urodzoną w Kanadzie. 
Kiedy miał 10 lat, dostał pierwszy komputer i nauczył się programować[9]. Mając 12 lat, sprzedał swój pierwszy program – grę komputerową Blastar za około 500 USD[9]. 
Jako nastolatek uczęszczał do Pretoria Boys High School, którą ukończył w wieku 17 lat. Krótko później, częściowo z chęci uniknięcia obowiązkowej służby wojskowej w Południowoafrykańskich Siłach Obronnych (SADF), wyemigrował do Kanady, gdzie mieszkała rodzina jego matki[9]. Planował przeniesienie się do USA[10][11]. 
W Kanadzie pracował u kuzyna na farmie w Swift Current, przy czyszczeniu kotłów w tartaku w Kolumbii Brytyjskiej i przy wyrębie lasów. Po dwóch latach przeniósł się do Toronto i pracował w dziale IT w banku, aplikując jednocześnie do Queen’s University. Opuścił Kanadę w 1992 roku po uzyskaniu stypendium na University of Pennsylvania. Tam uzyskał tytuł licencjata w dziedzinie ekonomii na wydziale Wharton Business School, po czym studiował tam jeszcze rok uzyskując tytuł licencjata w dziedzinie fizyki[12]. 
W 1995 roku rozpoczął studia na wydziale fizyki w Stanford University, po czym po dwóch dniach je rzucił, aby założyć przedsiębiorstwo Zip2. 
W 1995 roku Musk i jego brat Kimbal, korzystając z pieniędzy zebranych od niewielkiej grupy inwestorów-aniołów[13] oraz z pomocą finansową ojca w wysokości 200 tys. USD[14], założyli Zip2, firmę zajmującą się oprogramowaniem sieciowym. Firma opracowała i sprzedała internetowy „przewodnik po mieście” dla branży wydawniczej[15]. Musk uzyskał kontrakty z The New York Times i Chicago Tribune[16] oraz przekonał zarząd do porzucenia planów połączenia się z CitySearch. Będąc w Zip2, Musk chciał zostać CEO; jednak nikt z członków zarządu na to nie pozwolił. Compaq przejął Zip2 za 307 milionów USD w gotówce i 34 miliony USD w opcjach na akcje w lutym 1999[17]. Musk otrzymał 22 miliony USD za swój siedmioprocentowy udział w sprzedaży[16]. 
W marcu 1999 r. Musk został współzałożycielem X.com, firmy świadczącej usługi finansowe i obsługującej płatności za pośrednictwem poczty elektronicznej, o wartości 10 milionów USD. Pieniądze na firmę uzyskał ze sprzedaży Zip2[16][18]. Rok później X.com połączyło się z firmą Confinity[16], która była właścicielem PayPala, usługi transferu pieniędzy. Połączona firma skupiła się na usłudze PayPal i została przemianowana na „PayPal” w 2001 roku. Wczesny wzrost PayPal był napędzany głównie przez wirusową kampanię marketingową, w której rekrutowano nowych klientów, gdy otrzymywali pieniądze za pośrednictwem usługi[19]. Musk został w październiku 2000 r. usunięty ze swojej funkcji dyrektora generalnego (choć pozostał w zarządzie) ze względu na nieporozumienia z pozostałym kierownictwem firmy. Musk chciał zmigrować serwery PayPala z systemu Unix do systemu Microsoft Windows, z czym nie zgadzał się zarząd[20]. W październiku 2002 r. serwis eBay przejął PayPal za 1,5 mld USD w akcjach, z czego Musk otrzymał 165 mln USD. Przed sprzedażą Musk, który był największym udziałowcem spółki, posiadał 11,7% akcji PayPala[21]. 
W lipcu 2017 r. Musk kupił domenę x.com od PayPal za nieujawnioną kwotę, stwierdzając, że ma dla niego „wielką wartość sentymentalną”[22]. 
W czerwcu 2002 roku Musk założył swoje trzecie przedsiębiorstwo, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), którego obecnie[kiedy?] jest dyrektorem generalnym i technicznym. SpaceX zajmuje się projektowaniem i konstruowaniem rakiet nośnych dla pojazdów kosmicznych, kładąc nacisk na ich niski koszt i niezawodność. Celem, który postawił sobie Musk, jest 100-krotne zmniejszenie kosztów lotów w kosmos, między innymi poprzez wielokrotne starty tych samych egzemplarzy rakiet. Pierwszą opracowaną przez przedsiębiorstwo rakietą była Falcon 1, wystrzelona po raz pierwszy 24 marca 2006 roku. Rakieta ta we wrześniu 2009 r. jako pierwsza prywatna rakieta w historii astronautyki umieściła satelitę na orbicie Ziemi. Drugą rakietą jest Falcon 9, wystrzelona po raz pierwszy 4 czerwca 2010. Jej głównym zadaniem jest wynoszenie na orbitę stworzonych również przez to przedsiębiorstwo statków kosmicznych Dragon, obsługujących zaopatrzenie Międzynarodowej Stacji Kosmicznej. SpaceX pracuje również nad konstrukcją statku kosmicznego Starship, który ma być w stanie zapewnić obecność stałej kolonii na Marsie[23], oraz rozbudowuje konstelację satelitów Starlink, dostarczającą Internet satelitarny. 
23 grudnia 2008 roku SpaceX zdobyła wart 1,6 miliarda USD kontrakt na przeprowadzenie 12 lotów zaopatrzeniowych na Międzynarodową Stację Kosmiczną, przejmując rolę wahadłowców kosmicznych po ich wycofaniu z użytku w 2011 roku. Początkowo pojazdy Dragon mają przewozić jedynie zaopatrzenie, pozostawiając transport astronautów statkom Sojuz. Augustine commission rekomendowała, aby w przyszłości transport astronautów przekazać komercyjnym przedsiębiorstwom, takim jak SpaceX[24]. 
30 maja 2020 roku o godzinie 19:22 UTC (21:22 czasu polskiego) z platformy startowej na Florydzie wystartowała rakieta Falcon 9 z astronautami Robertem Behnkenem i Douglasem Hurleyem w ramach misji dostarczenia astronautów na Międzynarodową Stację Kosmiczną przez SpaceX[25]. 31 maja o godzinie 14:16 UTC (16:16 czasu polskiego), po kilkunastogodzinnym locie, kapsuła Dragon przycumowała do ISS, co zakończyło powodzeniem ten etap misji[26]. W jej ramach, astronauci pozostali na stacji przez kilka miesięcy, a następnie powrócili na Ziemię[25]. 
Musk postrzega badania kosmosu jako istotny krok w rozprzestrzenieniu, a nawet przetrwaniu ludzkiej świadomości. Stwierdził, że kolonizacja innych planet może stanowić zabezpieczenie przed zagrożeniami dla przetrwania gatunku: „Może nas zniszczyć uderzenie planetoidy, superwulkan, jak również zagrożenia, których dinozaury nigdy nie doświadczyły: zaprojektowany wirus, nieumyślne stworzenie mikro-czarnej dziury, katastrofalne globalne ocieplenie albo jakaś jeszcze nieznana technologia. Ludzkość ewoluowała przez miliony lat, ale w ciągu ostatnich sześćdziesięciu lat broń atomowa dała nam możliwość unicestwienia siebie. Prędzej czy później musimy rozprzestrzenić się poza tę zielono-niebieską kulę, albo wyginąć”[27]. 
Musk jest jednym ze współzałożycieli przedsiębiorstwa Tesla Motors i głównym architektem jej produktów. Od października 2008 r. jest jej dyrektorem generalnym. Tesla Motors wyprodukowała w pełni elektryczny samochód sportowy Tesla Roadster[28]. Musk jest autorem głównej biznesowej strategii przedsiębiorstwa, którą jest dostarczenie niedrogich elektrycznych samochodów do masowego klienta. Tesla Roadster został stworzony jako pierwszy krok – samochód skierowany do zamożnych klientów, którzy kupując go sfinansowaliby badania i projektowanie tańszych modeli. Kolejnym modelem jest sprzedawany od 2012 roku Model S – czterodrzwiowy rodzinny sedan, w najtańszej wersji kosztujący połowę tego co Roadster. Na bazie Modelu S zaprojektowano również crossover Model X z napędem na cztery koła i dwoma silnikami elektrycznymi. Samochody będą miały 60 proc. wspólnych części[29]. W marcu 2016 Musk zaprezentował ekonomiczny Model 3 o podstawowej cenie 35.000 dolarów, który jest przeznaczony dla masowego odbiorcy. Samochód wszedł na rynek w lipcu 2017[30]. Musk planuje również sprzedaż elektrycznych układów napędowych, które umożliwiłyby innym przedsiębiorstwom tworzenie własnych modeli bez konieczności opracowywania ich od podstaw[31]. W gazetach jego działania porównywane są do działań Henry’ego Forda za rewolucyjne podejście do rozwoju motoryzacji[11]. Od 1 lutego 2016 r. przedsiębiorstwo nosi nazwę Tesla Inc. Produkuje również samochody autonomiczne. 
W 2018 r. Elon Musk ogłosił na swoim koncie na Twitterze[32] nowe komediowe przedsięwzięcie medialne, Thud. Musk trafił na nagłówki satyrycznego serwisu informacyjnego „The Onion[33]” po tym, jak zatrudnił byłych pracowników serwisu. W 2014 r., przed przejęciem publikacji przez Univision, Musk wyraził zainteresowanie zakupem „The Onion”[34]. 
W grudniu 2015 roku Musk ogłosił utworzenie OpenAI, organizacji badawczej non-profit zajmującej się sztuczną inteligencją (AI). OpenAI ma na celu rozwój sztucznej inteligencji ogólnej w sposób bezpieczny i korzystny dla ludzkości[35]. 
Udostępniając sztuczną inteligencję wszystkim, OpenAI chce „przeciwstawiać się dużym korporacjom, które mogą zdobyć zbyt wielką władzę dzięki posiadaniu systemów super-inteligencji poświęconych zyskom, a także rządom, które mogą wykorzystywać sztuczną inteligencję do zdobycia władzy, a nawet do uciskania swoich obywateli”[36]. Musk stwierdził, że chce przeciwdziałać koncentracji władzy[16]. W 2018 r. Musk opuścił zarząd OpenAI, aby uniknąć „potencjalnego przyszłego konfliktu” ze swoją rolą dyrektora generalnego Tesli, ponieważ Tesla coraz bardziej angażuje się w AI[37]. 
W 2016 r. Musk został współzałożycielem Neuralink, firmy zajmującej się rozwojem neurotechnologii. Jej celem jest integracja ludzkiego mózgu ze sztuczną inteligencją. Firma, która wciąż znajduje się we wczesnym stadium rozwoju, koncentruje się na tworzeniu urządzeń, które mogą być wszczepiane do ludzkiego mózgu w celu ułatwienia ludziom łączenia się z oprogramowaniem i pozwolenie im na dotrzymanie kroku postępowi sztucznej inteligencji. Ulepszenia te mogą poprawić pamięć lub umożliwić bardziej bezpośredni kontakt z urządzeniami komputerowymi[38]. Musk uważa założenia Neuralink i OpenAI za powiązane: „OpenAI jest organizacją non-profit zajmującą się minimalizowaniem niebezpieczeństw związanych ze sztuczną inteligencją, podczas gdy Neuralink pracuje nad sposobami wszczepiania technologii w nasze mózgi w celu tworzenia interfejsów umysł-komputer. (...) Neuralink pozwala naszym mózgom zachować prowadzenie w wyścigu inteligencji: maszyny nie będą mogły nas prześcignąć, jeśli będziemy mieli wszystko, co mają maszyny i wszystko to, co my mamy. Przy założeniu, że to co mamy rzeczywiście daje nam przewagę[16]. 
16 lipca 2019 Elon Musk poinformował, że Neuralink doprowadził do tego, iż małpa, dzięki specjalnemu wszczepowi, mózgiem obsługiwała komputer[39]. 
Firma górnicza zajmująca się kopaniem tuneli, z siedzibą w Los Angeles, w Kalifornii, założona 17 grudnia 2016 przez Muska[40][41]. W styczniu 2018 r. sprzedała 20 tysięcy miotaczy ognia[42]. 
Musk jest również głównym inwestorem i członkiem zarządu przedsiębiorstwa SolarCity, przedsiębiorstwa produkującego ogniwa fotowoltaiczne, zarządzanej przez jego kuzyna Lyndona Rive[43][44]. Główną motywacją dla badań w SolarCity, podobnie jak w Tesla Motors, jest przeciwdziałanie globalnemu ociepleniu[45]. Obecnie firma została przejęta przez Tesla Inc. 
W dniu 12 sierpnia 2013 r. Musk zaprezentował propozycję nowej formy komunikacji między „the Greater Los Angeles Area” (grupa miast zgromadzonych wokół Los Angeles) i „the San Francisco Bay Area” (grupa miast zgromadzonych wokół San Francisco), po jego rozczarowaniu gdy projekt „California High-Speed Rail system” (Kalifornijskie Koleje Dużych Prędkości) został zaakceptowany. Nową formę komunikacji nazwał „Hyperloop”, jej zasięg obejmowałby około 560 km, od Sylmar (północna dzielnica Los Angeles) do Hayward (miasto położone we wschodniej części „the San Francisco Bay Area”) i teoretycznie umożliwiałaby podróżowanie między tymi obszarami w 30 minut lub mniej, zapewniając krótszy czas podróży niż nawet komercyjny samolot[46]. Musk proponuje: aby stworzyć podróż tańszą niż jakikolwiek inny środek transportu dla tak długich dystansów, zastosować podciśnienie w celu zmniejszenia oporu powietrza (pozwoliłoby to na dużą prędkość jazdy przy relatywnie małej mocy), całkowicie polegać na energii słonecznej przy wszystkich wymaganiach energetycznych. Całkowity koszt systemu oszacowano na 6 miliardów dolarów. 
W 2015 r. Musk ogłosił konkurs projektowy dla studentów i innych osób na budowę kapsuł Hyperloop, które miały działać na sponsorowanym przez SpaceX torze o długości mili, w ramach konkursu na kapsuły Hyperloop 2015-2017. Tor został wykorzystany po raz pierwszy w styczniu 2017 r., a Musk ogłosił również, że firma rozpoczęła projekt tunelu, którego celem jest lotnisko Hawthorne Municipal[47]. W lipcu 2017 r. Musk twierdził, że otrzymał ""ustną zgodę rządu"" na budowę hyperloopa z Nowego Jorku do Waszyngtonu, Wzmianka o planowanym odcinku z Waszyngtonu do Baltimore została usunięta ze strony internetowej Boring Company w 2021 r.[48] Projekt tunelu do Hawthorne został przerwany w 2022 r. i ma zostać przekształcony w miejsca parkingowe dla pracowników SpaceX[49]. W opinii biografa Ashlee Vance, Musk miał nadzieję, że Hyperloop ""zmusi opinię publiczną i ustawodawców do ponownego przemyślenia propozycji szybkiej kolei"" obecnej w Kalifornii w tamtym czasie i rozważenia bardziej ""kreatywnych"" pomysłów[50]. 
W celu wdrożenia koncepcji Hyperloop powstało kilka firm: Hyperloop One, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT), TransPod, Hardt Hyperloop, Nevomo, Zeleros i Arrivo, The Arrival Company (która została założona przez byłych pracowników Hyperloop One). Sam Musk nie jest zaangażowany w żadną z tych firm. 
Musk przewodniczy Fundacji Muska, finansującej edukację naukową, pomoc pediatryczną i badania nad czystą energią. Jest powiernikiem X PRIZE Foundation, promującej technologie odnawialnych źródeł energii. Zasiada w zarządzie Space Foundation, The Planetary Society, The National Academies Aeronautics, Space Engineering Board i Stanford Engineering Advisory Board. 
W 2001 roku Musk stworzył plany projektu „Mars Oasis”, którego celem byłoby umieszczenie na powierzchni Marsa miniaturowej szklarni i badanie rozwoju roślin na marsjańskim regolicie[51][52]. Zawiesił ten projekt, gdy zorientował się, że koszty transportu wielokrotnie przewyższyłyby wszystkie inne koszty. Zamiast tego zdecydował się pracować nad rozwojem transportu kosmicznego i stworzył przedsiębiorstwo SpaceX. 
Zagrał niewielką rolę w filmie Iron Man 2[53]. Zdjęcia do tego filmu były kręcone w fabryce należącej do SpaceX. Musk jeździł samochodem McLaren F1, który kupił za około milion USD i sprzedał w 2007 roku za około 1,5 miliona USD. Posiada także prywatne samoloty Aero L-39 Albatros[54] oraz Dassault Falcon 900, użyty na planie filmu Dziękujemy za palenie, którego był producentem[55]. Pojawił się również jako słuchacz przemówienia Willa Castera granego przez Johnny’ego Deppa w filmie Transcendencja[56]. Musk wystąpił w filmie Maczeta zabija[57] jako on sam. W jednym z odcinków serialu Teoria wielkiego podrywu[58] pojawia się jako on sam w roli wolontariusza w stołówce dla ubogich. W szóstym odcinku pierwszego sezonu serialu Young Sheldon[59] został poruszony wątek firmy SpaceX, a Elon Musk zagrał samego siebie. 
Musk mieszka w Bel Air w Kalifornii. Ma pięciu synów ze swoją eksżoną, kanadyjską aktorką i pisarką Justine Musk. Jego drugą żoną była brytyjska aktorka Talulah Riley, znana z roli Annabelle Fritton w filmie Dziewczyny z St. Trinian. Rozwiódł się z nią w roku 2012[60]. Od 2013 do 2016 roku ponownie był żonaty z Talulahą Riley. W 2017 roku spotykał się z modelką oraz aktorką Amber Heard, z którą zakończył związek w lutym 2018. W kwietniu 2018 roku związał się z kanadyjską piosenkarką i kompozytorką Claire Boucher. 4 maja 2020 para powitała swojego pierwszego syna. W grudniu 2021 roku para doczekała się drugiego dziecka, urodzonego przez surogatkę[61]. W 2022 para się rozstała[62]. 
Rodzeństwo Muska również urodziło i wychowało się w Południowej Afryce, u progu dorosłości emigrując do Ameryki Północnej. Mieszkająca w Kanadzie Tosca Musk, siostra Elona, jest założycielką Musk Entertainment i producentką kilkunastu filmów[63][64]. Sam Elon Musk był producentem jej pierwszego filmu Puzzled[65]. Kimbal Musk, brat, jest dyrektorem generalnym przedsiębiorstwa OneRiot specjalizującego się w wyszukiwaniu w sieci w czasie rzeczywistym oraz właścicielem restauracji The Kitchen w Boulder. Podobnie jak Elon, po emigracji do Ameryki Północnej, z Kanady trafił do Stanów Zjednoczonych. 
W trakcie programu Saturday Night Live wyznał, że ma zespół Aspergera[66]. 
(w mld$) 
W październiku 2008 roku, po potwierdzeniu wcześniejszych doniesień[69], że Tesla Motors ma tylko 9 mln USD na swoich kontach[70], Musk zatrudnił zewnętrzne przedsiębiorstwo do przejrzenia wewnętrznych e-maili i logów z komunikatorów, a następnie zatrudnił detektywa do zebrania odcisków palców z wydruków pozostawionych przy kopiarkach w przedsiębiorstwie. W ten sposób wykrył, że pracownik Peng Zhou był źródłem przecieku o stanie majątku przedsiębiorstwa. Musk zaoferował Zhou opcję przeproszenia przedsiębiorstwa i rezygnacji ze stanowiska zamiast bycia oskarżonym. Zhou tę propozycję przyjął[71]. 
Po tym incydencie Musk usiłował wykryć pracowników ujawniających wewnętrzne informacje przedsiębiorstwa przez wysyłanie im minimalnie zmodyfikowanych wersji okólników, chcąc sprawdzić, która wersja trafi do prasy. Plan się nie powiódł, ponieważ główny prawnik w przedsiębiorstwie, Craig Harding, wysłał swoją wersję do wszystkich pracowników, dodając do niej ostrzejsze warunki umowy poufności[72]. 
26 maja 2009 roku były dyrektor Tesla Motors Martin Eberhard złożył pozew przeciwko Muskowi za zniesławienie i złamanie umowy. Tematem pozwu była kwestia określenia, kto ma prawo używać tytułu „założyciela” Tesla Motors[73]. 29 lipca 2009 roku sąd odrzucił ten wniosek. Oficjalne oświadczenie przedsiębiorstwa określiło tę decyzję jako „spójną z przekonaniem o wspólnym udziale zespołu założycieli, włączając w to aktualnego dyrektora Elona Muska i głównego inżyniera J.B. Straubela, którzy obaj byli kluczowi dla stworzenia Tesli od jej początków”[74]. 
Na początku sierpnia Eberhard wycofał wniosek[75], a ostateczne porozumienie zostało osiągnięte 21 września. Dokładne warunki tego porozumienia nie zostały ujawnione, ale od tego czasu oficjalnymi założycielami Tesli są Martin Eberhard, Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Marc Tarpenning i Ian Wright[76]. 
2 lipca 2018 po akcji poszukiwawczej w tajlandzkiej jaskini Tham Luang została znaleziona grupa 13 turystów (12 młodych członków drużyny piłkarskiej oraz trenera). Wysoki poziom wody uniemożliwiał ich łatwe wyciągnięcie. 6 lipca Elon Musk ogłosił, że pracujący dla niego inżynierowie z firm SpaceX oraz Boring Company udali się na miejsce, by pomóc w akcji ratunkowej[77]. Zaoferował również użycie specjalnie zaprojektowanej miniłodzi ratunkowej[78]. W rozmowie z CNN brytyjski nurek Vernon Unsworth skrytykował pomysł Muska i powiedział, że może on „wsadzić sobie swoją kapsułę tam, gdzie boli”. W odpowiedzi na to, miliarder wypuścił serię wpisów w serwisie Twitter, w których stwierdził, że nigdy nie widział Vernona w jaskini, poprosił go o wysłanie filmu z akcji ratunkowej, po czym dodał, że film nie będzie potrzebny, bo jego kapsuła dotrze na miejsce pobytu chłopców. Wszystko podsumował słowami „Sam się o to prosiłeś, pedofilu”. Po dwóch dniach Musk przeprosił za swoje słowa[79].

Meet The Teams.","Phase Active $100M Prize For Carbon Removal $100 Million Prize Purse XPRIZE Carbon Removal is aimed at tackling the biggest threat facing humanity - fighting climate change and rebalancing Earth’s carbon cycle. Funded by Elon Musk and the Musk Foundation, this $100M competition is the largest incentive prize in history, an extraordinary milestone.‎ Overview   Meet The Teams Truly Meaningful Impact  The climate math is becoming clear that we will need gigaton-scale carbon removal in the coming decades to avoid the worst effects of climate change. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates the need at approximately 10 gigatonnes of net CO2 removal per year by the year 2050 in order to keep global temperature rise under 1.5 or 2C. As governments, companies, investors, and entrepreneurs make plans to meet this challenge, it is clear that we will need a range of carbon removal solutions to be proven through demonstration and deployment to complement work that is already underway. If humanity continues on a business-as-usual path, the global average temperature could increase 6˚(C) by the year 2100.  This four-year global competition invites innovators and teams from anywhere on the planet to create and demonstrate solutions that can pull carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere or oceans, and sequester it durably and sustainably. To win the grand prize, teams must demonstrate a working solution at a scale of at least 1000 tonnes removed per year; model their costs at a scale of 1 million tonnes per year; and show a pathway to achieving a scale of gigatonnes per year in future. Any carbon negative solution is eligible: nature-based, direct air capture, oceans, mineralization, or anything else that achieves net negative emissions, sequesters CO2 durably, and show a sustainable path to achieving low cost at gigatonne scale. Thank you to our early innovators, and sponsors, who knew Carbon Removal would become an XPRIZE: Chuck Brady, Jeff Holden, Tylee Potter, Jon Vein, Paresh Ghelani, Eric Hirshberg, Dave Asprey, Thomas Ermacora, Ryan Duffy, Harry Kloor and Thomas Middleditch.

Elon Musk warned in a meeting with senators and other tech CEOs about the ""civilizational risk"" posed by artificial intelligence, in a ..."," Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — Tech billionaire Elon Musk warned senators in a private gathering on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that artificial intelligence poses a “civilizational risk” to governments and societies, according to a senator in the room. Musk made his remarks at a first-of-its-kind closed-door summit on AI featuring a who’s who of Big Tech titans, who also included Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Sundar Pichai and Sam Altman. All 100 senators were invited, though not all attended.   As he left the Capitol after several hours, Musk — the wealthiest person in the world — called the gathering “historic.” He also endorsed the idea of a new federal agency to oversee AI and repeated his warning that artificial intelligence poses a tremendous danger. “The consequences of AI going wrong are severe so we have to be proactive rather than reactive,” Musk told a gaggle of reporters before he ducked into his waiting Tesla. “The question is really one of civilizational risk. It’s not like … one group of humans versus another. It’s like, hey, this is something that’s potentially risky for all humans everywhere,” he said. Asked whether AI will destroy mankind, Musk paused and replied: “There is some chance that is above zero that AI will kill us all. I think it’s low. But if there’s some chance, I think we should also consider the fragility of human civilization."" Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., who attended the private gathering, said she was struck by Musk’s phrase “civilizational risk.” She wrote it down in her notebook and showed it to two reporters. Other panelists, she said, talked about the need for immigration reform to allow more high-tech workers in the U.S. and the need for standards reforms at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. “You had everything from there to sort of the high-level comment about the civilizational risks associated with AI, which is a very 60,000-foot-level remark, and it was everything in between, so I thought it was surprisingly interesting and helpful. And I’m glad I went,” Lummis said. The bipartisan gathering, dubbed the AI Insight Forum, was hosted by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sens. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., Todd Young, R-Ind., and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M. More AI forums will be held through the end of the year, serving as brainstorming sessions about how lawmakers can regulate artificial intelligence. “We got some consensus on some things. … I asked everyone in the room does government need to play a role in regulating AI, and every single person raised their hand, even though they had diverse views,” Schumer told reporters Wednesday. “So that gives us a message here that we have to try to act, as difficult as the process might be.” Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, did not answer questions as he left the summit. His team provided his prepared remarks from inside the room, where he said the onus is on government to regulate AI. “I agree that Congress should engage with AI to support innovation and safeguards,” he said. “This is an emerging technology, there are important equities to balance here, and the government is ultimately responsible for that.” Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT parent company OpenAI, said he was surprised, given the format, by the broad agreement in the room on “the need to take this seriously and treat it with urgency.” “I think people all agreed that this is something that we need the government’s leadership on,” Altman told reporters during a break. “Some disagreement about how it should happen, but unanimity this is important and urgent.” Inside the cavernous Kennedy Caucus Room, the 22 panelists and hosting senators were seated in a U shape. On one side of the room was Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the owner of the social media site X; on the other side of the room was Zuckerberg, who has clashed with Musk in the past and recently launched a rival to X called Threads. The daylong, high-profile gathering has its share of skeptics in both parties. Some senators lamented that the so-called AI Insight Forum was closed to the public and the media (reporters were briefly allowed in the room before the forum began to view the set-up). Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said it would allow tech billionaires to lobby senators behind closed doors about one of the most critical issues facing the country and economy. “They’re sitting at a big round table all by themselves. All of the senators are to sit there and ask no questions,” said a frustrated Warren, who this week called on the Senate to investigate Musk’s alleged role in thwarting a Ukrainian drone from attacking Russia’s naval fleet last year in the Black Sea. Schumer dismissed the criticism, noting that three public hearings on AI have been held and that the forums include not just tech billionaires, but also labor and civil rights leaders, national security experts and academics. “It was a very productive meeting. At first blush, you would think that given all the tech people that were there, their voices would be overwhelming,” Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said in an interview. “But what happened instead was there was a lot of consensus about how the safety needs are hugely important to really engage the innovation and that those two things go hand in hand.” Schumer argued in an interview Tuesday that doing nothing on AI is unacceptable. “AI is going to be the most transformative thing affecting us in the next decades. It’s going to affect every aspect of life. It has tremendous potential to do some really good things: cure cancer, make our food supply better, deal with our national security, help our education. It has tremendous potential to do bad things: allow continuation of bias, throw many people out of work and even let some of our adversaries get ahead of us,” Schumer said. “When it’s something this difficult and this pervasive and this changing — it’s changing rapidly — the average instinct of Congress is ‘Let’s ignore it; let someone else do it,’” he continued. “There is no one else to do it. We can’t be like ostriches and put our heads in the sand, because if government doesn’t involve itself in putting in some real guardrails, this thing could run amok.” Two tech executives warned senators at a public hearing Tuesday that an emergency brake is needed for critical systems run by AI, like power grids or water supplies, to protect humans from potential harms caused by the emergent technology. In addition to Musk, Zuckerberg, Gates and Altman, the CEOs of Google, IBM, Microsoft, Nvidia and Palantir were on hand at Wednesday’s forum, along with the heads of labor, human rights and entertainment groups. They include Elizabeth Shuler, the president of the AFL-CIO; Charles Rivkin, the chairman and CEO of the Motion Picture Association; Janet Murguía, the president of UnidosUS; and Maya Wiley, the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil & Human Rights. Wednesday’s inaugural forum was scheduled to run seven hours, with a break for lunch. Schumer and Rounds moderated the discussion, with help from Heinrich and Young, aides said. Senators were not expected to get an opportunity to directly ask questions of the tech execs; the usually loquacious senators were instructed to submit written questions. While organizers emphasized the bipartisan nature of the forum, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he chose not to attend. “I think the idea that it is some great breakthrough to hear from the biggest monopolists in the world — and that they are going to share with us their great wisdom — I just think the whole framework is wrong,” said Hawley, who announced a bipartisan AI framework with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. “You got to take it with a grain of salt. You got to realize that they’re interested parties, right? They stand to make a lot of money on this, which is fine,” he continued, “but you got to know that I just think the whole framing that ‘Oh, aren’t we so graced by their presence?’ — I mean, give me a break. These people are — they’ve done bad things for our country.” CORRECTION (Sept. 14, 2023, 7:55 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated Elon Musk’s position at X.

Editor’s Note: After this story published, Walter Isaacson clarified his explanation regarding Elon Musk restricting Ukrainian military access to Starlink, a critical satellite internet service. This story has been updated to reflect that change.        Elon Musk secretly ordered his engineers not to turn on his company’s Starlink satellite communications network near the Crimean coast last year to disrupt a Ukrainian sneak attack on the Russian naval fleet, according to an excerpt adapted from Walter Isaacson’s new biography of the eccentric billionaire titled “Elon Musk.” 
   
      CNN was provided the excerpt, which has since been amended, according to a version now published by The Washington Post.
   
      Musk’s decision, which left Ukrainian officials begging him to turn the satellites on, was driven by an acute fear that Russia would respond to a Ukrainian attack on Crimea with nuclear weapons, a fear driven home by Musk’s conversations with senior Russian officials, according to Isaacson, whose new book is set to be released by Simon & Schuster on September 12. 
   
      Musk’s concerns over a “mini-Pearl Harbor” as he put it, did not come to pass in Crimea. But the episode reveals the unique position Musk found himself in as the war in Ukraine unfolded. Whether intended or not, he had become a power broker US officials couldn’t ignore.
   
      Musk did not respond to CNN’s request for comment before publication. But he did respond to the Isaacson book excerpt late Thursday on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter that he owns, by asserting that the Starlink service provided by his company SpaceX was never active over Crimea and that the Ukrainian government made an “emergency request” to him to turn on service.
   
      “There was an emergency request from government authorities to activate Starlink all the way to Sevastopol,” Musk posted on X, the platform formally known as Twitter that he owns. Sevastopol is a port city in Crimea. “The obvious intent being to sink most of the Russian fleet at anchor. If I had agreed to their request, then SpaceX would be explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation.”
   
      The new book from Isaacson, the author of acclaimed biographies of Steve Jobs and Albert Einstein, provides fresh insights into Musk and how his existential dread of sparking a wider war drove him to spurn Ukrainian requests for Starlink systems they could use to attack the Russians. 
   
      After Russia disrupted Ukraine’s communications systems just before its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Musk agreed to provide Ukraine with millions of dollars of SpaceX-made Starlink satellite terminals, which became crucial to Ukraine’s military operations. Even as cellular phone and internet networks had been destroyed, the Starlink terminals allowed Ukraine to fight and stay connected.
   
      But once Ukraine began to use Starlink terminals for offensive attacks against Russia, Musk started to second-guess that decision. 
   
      “How am I in this war?” Musk asks Isaacson. “Starlink was not meant to be involved in wars. It was so people can watch Netflix and chill and get online for school and do good peaceful things, not drone strikes.”
   
      Musk was soon on the phone with President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, the chairman of the joint chiefs, Gen. Mark Milley, and the Russian ambassador to the US to address anxieties from Washington, DC, to Moscow, writes Isaacson.
   
      Meanwhile, Mykhailo Fedorov, a deputy prime minister of Ukraine, was pleading with Musk to allow connectivity for the submarine drones by telling Musk about their capabilities in a text message, according to Isaacson. “I just want you—the person who is changing the world through technology—to know this,” Fedorov told Musk.
   
      SpaceX did not reply to CNN’s requests for comment.
   
      Musk, the CEO of electric carmaker Tesla and private space exploration firm SpaceX, replied that he was impressed with the design of the submarine drones but that he wouldn’t turn satellite coverage on for Crimea because Ukraine “is now going too far and inviting strategic defeat,” according to Isaacson. 
   
      The unchartered territory that Ukrainian and US officials were in – relying on the charity of an unpredictable billionaire for battlefield communications – also led to a standoff over who would pay for the Starlink terminals last fall. 
   
      SpaceX had spent tens of millions of its own money sending the satellite equipment to Ukraine, according to Musk. And the company told the Pentagon that they wouldn’t continue to foot the bill for the satellite gear, as CNN first reported last October. 
   
      After CNN’s reporting, Musk reversed course, tweeting “the hell with it … we’ll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free.”
   
      Gwynne Shotwell, Musk’s president at SpaceX, was livid at Musk’s reversal, according to Isaacson. 
   
      “The Pentagon had a $145 million check ready to hand to me, literally,” Isaacson quotes Shotwell as saying. “Then Elon succumbed to the bullshit on Twitter and to the haters at the Pentagon who leaked the story.” 
   
      But SpaceX was eventually able to work out a deal with the US and European governments to pay for another 100,000 new satellite dishes to Ukraine at the beginning of 2023, according to Isaacson. 
   
      Starlink’s importance in the war hasn’t waned.  
   
      Last week, the US and its “Five Eyes” allies accused Russian hackers of targeting Ukrainian commanders’ battlefield communications. The Russians’ malicious code was designed to intercept data sent to Starlink satellites, according to the Ukrainians.

What makes Elon Musk tick? I spent months following the same people as him to find out who fuels his curious worldview · it like to be Elon Musk ...","Tucker Carlson, Greta Thunberg, Covid sceptics, military historians, the royal family … What would my time immersed in the Twitter/X owner’s feed reveal about the richest man in the world? What’s it like to be Elon Musk? On almost every level it is impossible to imagine – he’s just too much. Musk is the hands-on head of three mega-companies, one (Tesla) wildly successful, one (SpaceX) madly aspirational, one (Twitter/X) a shambles. He has plenty of other businesses on the side, including The Boring Company (which makes hi-tech tunnels), Neuralink (which makes brain-computer interfaces), and his current pet favourite xAI (mission: “To understand the true nature of the universe”). He is the on-again, off-again richest human being on the planet, his personal net worth sometimes fluctuating by more than $10bn a day as the highly volatile Tesla share price lurches up and down. He is the father of 11 children – one of whom died as an infant, and from one of whom he is currently estranged – with three different women, which to his own mind at least seems to make him some kind of family man. He has 155 million followers on Twitter/X (we’ll call it Twitter from now on for simplicity’s sake), which is more than anyone else. Only a very few people – Barack Obama (132 million), Justin Bieber (111 million) – can have any idea of what that is like. However, unlike Obama, who follows 550,000 accounts on Twitter, Musk follows only 415. That anyone can copy (or at least they could, before the platform recently changed its code so you can now only see a small handful of users’ followers rather than the full list). So that’s what I did, spending this past summer following the exact same accounts Musk follows and no one else, to see what the world looks like from inside his personal Twitter bubble. I wanted to be a fly on the wall in the room with the people who are shaping the thoughts of one of the most influential, and unpredictable, individuals on the planet. I should add that I’ve never followed anyone else on Twitter before – I’ve never even had a Twitter account – so it was all new to me. What can I say? It’s pretty mind-blowing. Musk’s Twitterverse is not so weird in the ways you might expect, given his reputation as an “alt-right”, take-no-prisoners cybertroll. Some of it is highly conventional. He follows the official accounts of a fair few of the world’s Most Important People – Sunak, Macron, Modi, Von der Leyen, the EU, the US state department, the royal family – which means his timeline is occasionally cluttered up with the banalities of government press releases and happy birthday greetings to the Prince of Wales. Musk never engages with these accounts – I’m guessing he barely notices them. It looks like little more than a hat-tip to the top table of world affairs: “Hi guys, I’m here too,” is what he’s saying. He also follows BBC Breaking News, which means he gets to hear about flash floods in Tiverton as they happen. It’s just for show. He has barely concealed contempt for the BBC, which he regards as a pillar of the pointless legacy media. (He loathes the Guardian too, but we’ll come to that.) At the same time as blowing virtual smoke up the arses of his fellow world leaders, a lot of the accounts he follows are there to blow plug-in smoke up his arse. His timeline is peppered with posts from assorted Tesla boosters, such as Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, Car Dealership Guy and a slew of other happy investors in his business, who spend their time telling the big boss how amazing he is and wetting themselves at each new rollout or share price spike. Musk does engage with these people. He feeds them goodies like a dog owner might treat his pets, with little hints about what’s coming next. Some of these accounts even revere his mother, Maye Musk (according to her Twitter bio, a “Bestselling International Author/Doctor of Dietetics/Supermodel”) – who was invited to give the keynote this summer at the annual gathering of the Silicon Valley Tesla crowd. Musk, as a family man, likes that. But in between all the fawning and being fawned on is where the real action is. Musk mainly follows a bunch of contrarian, lib-baiting men (they are almost all men, with the notable exception of Josie Glabach, AKA the Redheaded Libertarian, a prolific tweeter of “alt-right” talking points, self-described as “Student of History ∙ Daughter of Liberty ∙ Weirdest haters you’ve ever seen ∙ Keeper of Receipts ∙ Do No Harm But Take No Sh*t ∙ 1776”). From these accounts a distinct worldview emerges, one that Musk does not actively promote but tacitly endorses, with likes, retweets and the occasional emoji of encouragement. During the time I was following what he followed, four big issues dominated his little corner of the Twittersphere. First, like many of those on his timeline, Musk is up in arms about gender transitioning for children and the wider exposure of kids to what he sees as a politicised sex education (or sexualised politics). Musk shared a photo of a pregnant woman saying: “Is it a boy or a girl?” and a man responding: “We’ll let the kindergarten teacher decide.” Second, there is a strong pro-Russia vibe. Many of those he follows are deeply sceptical of the Ukraine-leaning sympathies of most western politicians – Boris Johnson, about whom no one in Muskworld otherwise cares, is cast as a supervillain in this context, the man who supposedly scuppered the chances of a Russia-friendly peace deal after the invasion in 2022 with his nonsensical Churchillian pretensions. Zelenskiy is treated as a joke. Third, this is a hotbed of Covid scepticism. Musk follows Jay Bhattacharya, Stanford professor of medicine and one of the co-authors of the Great Barrington declaration, which advocated lifting almost all Covid restrictions and allowing herd immunity to develop. Around Bhattacharya are a host of like-minded critics of what they see as government overreaction and overreach in response to the pandemic. They spend a lot of their time goading government officials who are now under the spotlight in public inquiries around the world examining, with hindsight, the costs and benefits of lockdown. The tone is contemptuous: anyone who championed lockdown at the time might just be forgiven for blind panic; but anyone who still defends it now is clearly a shill or a stooge. Finally, lapping round the edges of all this is a steady lament for the end of western civilisation. Musk follows a host of accounts that celebrate classical heritage and traditional architecture (“Why can’t we make buildings like that any more?” is a common refrain). He follows Aesthetica (“Aesthetics | History | Chivalry | Fantasy | Vitalist Artist”) and The Knowledge Archivist (“Useful knowledge from the lives of the Greatest People in History”). He likes military history and tales of heroism and derring-do. And along with many of those he follows, he thinks we are committing slow collective suicide by not having enough children – declining birthrates across the developed world mean giving up on the future or handing it over to machines. Many of those who love what Musk is doing for the car industry also love what he’s doing for procreation: he’s keeping his own end up. Still, it’s worth saying what Musk’s Twitterverse is not. It’s not Trumpy. There are very few Trump enthusiasts here and Musk himself – who says he voted for Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020 – for a while seemed to favour Ron DeSantis, whose campaign he helped to launch with a disastrous interview on Twitter Spaces that was memorable only for the catastrophic failure of the tech. There is little or no climate scepticism. Tesla describes itself as a clean energy company, and Musk does not seem to doubt that radical action on global warming/heating/boiling is needed. That he wants to do it himself – and make vast sums of money out of it – doesn’t alter the fact that Covid scepticism and climate scepticism, which often go together, don’t here. He follows Greta Thunberg and does not troll her, though whether that’s because he is interested in what she has to say or just because she’s a Very Important Person is not clear. In the past he has even called her “cool”. In fact, he doesn’t really troll anyone, apart from stock analysts who short the Tesla share price (Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money on CNBC, is a favourite punchbag). He may have learned his lesson after he mocked a disabled Twitter worker, Haraldur Thorleifsson,  in March for doing “no actual work” and had to issue a grovelling apology (“I would like to apologize to Halli for my misunderstanding of his situation. It was based on things I was told that were untrue or, in some cases, true, but not meaningful.”) Whenever Musk intercedes with the various excitable types he follows, it is often to inject a note of caution. For instance, when lockdown pushback tips over into outright vaccine denialism, Musk sometimes tries to set the record straight in his inimitable deadpan style: “To be frank, we’re lucky to have modern medicine.” When his timeline was abuzz – as periodically happens – with rumours that the federal government was about to let slip its cache of evidence that extraterrestrials are real and have visited, Musk responded with: “I have seen zero evidence of aliens fwiw.” That “for-what-it’s-worth” is a quintessential Muskian humblebrag. He happens to think that on many questions his view counts for an awful lot. This may look like megalomania. But given the tsunami of attention even his smallest thoughts receive, it is also a fair reflection of fact. In an interview posted by Tucker Carlson – whom Musk both follows and promotes (he provided Carlson his own platform after he was fired from Fox News), and who absolutely does believe the US secret state is covering up its alien encounters – Musk explained that there were three reasons to be doubtful. First, because he knows more about space than anyone else: he of all people would have heard something, and he hasn’t. Second, because everyone should recognise that the US military is only interested in increasing its budget, which would skyrocket if it could show that the little green men were already here. And third, because Musk himself would have to be part of the cover-up, and anyone who knows him knows that he would never miss out on the chance to get the most retweets in human history, as would surely happen when he posted the big reveal. At that point, both he and Carlson collapsed in uncontrollable laughter, Carlson because he is a sycophant, Musk because he seems to find the whole thing genuinely hilarious. Like many people who flirt with conspiratorial thinking without ever diving in, the closest Musk will get to endorsing the paranoid fantasies that fly around on his timeline is to respond: “Interesting”, “Good question” or just plain “!”. Underneath one of Carlson’s meandering tours around Jeffrey Epstein, the Clintons, Ukraine, Hunter Biden and the rest, Musk limits his response to: “Raises interesting questions.” He wants to come across not as a 21st-century crazy, but as an enlightenment rationalist who takes nothing for granted, has no faith in received opinion, and likes to do his own thinking. But what he really resembles is an over-stimulated child: the endlessly questioning, often infuriating schoolboy who has started to read for himself and no longer believes what the teachers are telling him, without quite knowing what he believes instead. In truth, Musk plays up to his persona as a socially awkward naïf asking the questions others shy away from. He is proudly on the autistic spectrum and believes – like Greta Thunberg – that his Asperger’s gives him insights that are only available to those who don’t take the conventional social cues to follow the herd. “Affective autism > effective altruism?” is one of his mantras. In an interview in which he discusses his unhappy childhood, Musk describes the existential crisis he suffered as an 11- or 12-year-old, when he realised that human beings had almost no understanding of the true nature of the universe: religion couldn’t explain it, and science was still relatively clueless. We are just flailing around in the dark, lost and alone. He concluded that the only thing for it was to “increase the scale and scope of civilisation” – intergalactically if necessary – so as to arrive at something better: more people and more ideas means better answers to the biggest questions. He hankers to be less lost, less alone. What is so remarkable about Musk is that he remains recognisably the same restless, madly grandiose, oddly vulnerable child he was back then. But he’s a child with $200bn in his back pocket and a near-limitless capacity for mischief. The scale of Musk’s wealth and influence, coupled with his willingness to behave as though he had neither, makes him almost impossible to pin down. His engagement with his Twitter feed is madly promiscuous and frequently baffling (how, apart from anything, does he have the time?). One day it’s all Tesla or SpaceX promos. The next it’s his tuppence worth on issues great and small. When someone posts about Listerine cool mints circa 2007, he responds: “Still the most effective breath mint afaik”. You’d think maybe someone was being paid to do this for him, but no one would dare be so banal other than the man himself. You’d think maybe someone was paying him to do it, until you realise no one – certainly not Listerine – could pay him enough. Yet there’s the other Musk too: along with the child behind the businessman, there’s always the businessman behind the child. Musk’s Twitter persona is simultaneously an authentic expression of his extremely unusual personality and a transparently contrived effort to market the platform by marketing himself. A lot of what’s on Musk’s Twitter feed are tweets about Twitter, in which Musk takes a personal interest because he owns the damn thing. So when people share their views about what they love about Twitter – and loathe about its latest rival, Threads – Musk responds with smiley faces and tears of laughter and little thought-burps of his own love for the platform. He wants you to know he’s a Twitter fan too, fwiw. Which is about $44bn. In the great summer 2023 battle with Threads, along with challenging Mark Zuckerberg to a cage fight (which could just as easily be the work of the child behind the businessman or the businessman behind the child), Musk has done his best to try to establish what makes Twitter different and worth sticking with. His pitch is simple. It is real in the way that Zuckerberg’s products – and particularly Instagram – are not. Yes, being on Twitter might mean that people are mean to you, but at least that means you are facing reality. As Musk put it in July: “It is infinitely preferable to be attacked by strangers on Twitter than indulge in the fake happiness of hide-the-pain-Instagram.” More than that, he says Twitter is where you go to get your worldview challenged, which won’t happen anywhere else in our increasingly siloed online world. And Twitter is also where you go to get your laughs. Which is odd, because on Musk’s feed almost no one ever challenges his worldview and almost no one ever says anything remotely funny, even though the tone is relentlessly – one might say depressingly – jocular. In two months of following what Musk follows, I don’t think I laughed once. Maybe that’s just me. There are lots of jokes. Here’s one from the World of Engineering account: “What happens when a computer engineer fails flirting with a waitress? Error in connecting to the server.” Musk liked that one. I suppose it is funny, in the sense that it’s funny-peculiar to think that anyone might think that flirting could be viewed as a success/fail operation, like writing code. But it’s not funny ha-ha.

He follows the Not Jerome Powell account, which has as its core function trolling the chair of the Federal Reserve but spends much of its time posting unflattering photos of Hillary Clinton or of Volodymyr Zelenskiy looking sad. The lib-baiting in general takes the form of juxtaposing progressive views with pictures of unappealing people doing dumb things. Typical example: a photo of a fat man in pink leggings and a hideous blue top with the tagline: “Just so you know … This is the guy calling you a Nazi on the internet.” It’s exhausting. Musk’s choice of accounts to follow is not ideologically homogeneous – there is a range of views here – but it’s not remotely challenging. He doesn’t follow anyone making a serious case for the things he despises – liberalism, the mainstream news media, gender diversity, Ukraine. When he comes across those viewpoints, it’s just by chance and he can ignore them. The only pro-Ukrainian comments I saw on his timeline either came from the state department or from Greta Thunberg, who shares the view of most of her generation that Zelenskiy is a hero. They might as well have come from the royal family. Musk doesn’t care. What changed over the summer was not Musk’s attitude to anything out there in the world, but his attitude to Twitter itself. What appeared on his timeline shifted dramatically, but only because it started to get cluttered up with ads and promoted tweets as Musk moved to monetise the loss-making business. To be honest, as someone new to the platform, I’d been quite enjoying it until it became just another hideous mess of mindless marketisation. Still, I got to see a version of what the algorithm thinks someone like Musk might want to buy. It was a mix of ads for nifty tech-bro gear – backpacks, running shoes – and an amazing number of promos for the movies Oppenheimer and Napoleon. You don’t have to be Einstein (whose biographer, Walter Isaacson, has just published a biography of Musk) to work out that these movies might be thought to appeal because Musk sees himself as belonging in their company. No question that somewhere in his head the biopic of his own life is running in the background. Many of the not-Einsteins on Musk’s timeline helpfully made that point to him – see the Napoleon film, Elon, it might have been made for you! Then it all changed again, once the platform ceased to be Twitter and became X. Like much of what Musk does, the overnight rebrand was both unexpected and heavily telegraphed. He’d spent months saying that Twitter couldn’t carry on as it was. One of his calling cards as an entrepreneur is simultaneously to talk up and to trash his own businesses. Tesla, he says, is either going to win the future or it’s already effectively worthless. Twitter was going to have to become an all-purpose platform for everyday life (payments, communication, content provision) or it was done. Musk admires the Chinese and particularly apps such as WeChat that have colonised much of Chinese life, going way beyond anything Twitter was capable of. He bought the platform to try to turn it into an everything app, fully aware that he risked turning it into a nothing app instead. This all-or-nothing approach is an essential feature of the Musk worldview. If I had to give it a name I’d call it upbeat apocalypticism. He’s relentlessly cheery when contemplating coming catastrophe. His approach to his mooted fight with Zuckerberg – which his online cheerleaders were greatly looking forward to on the assumption that their man was bound to win, despite his opponent being a trained jiu-jitsu champion – was to post jokes about the chances of his dying in there. His philosophy is not so much nothing ventured, nothing gained, as everything ventured, then let’s see who’s still standing. He genuinely seems to lack a fear of failure, or of looking ridiculous (as he does now the fight has been cancelled). Whatever happens, it’s still better than being the 11-year-old him, contemplating the empty unknowability of the universe. What helps to fuel this outlook is the fact that the stakes genuinely aren’t as high for Musk as they would be for everyone else. When he bid $44bn for Twitter it looked extraordinarily reckless – as well as typically impulsive – a view that seemed to be confirmed when he tried to pull out of the deal only to be told that his hands were tied. The Tesla share price was in freefall at the time, and Musk’s personal net worth was tanking with it. But during the time I was sharing his timeline – just a couple of months – his net worth increased by more than the amount he paid for Twitter. Buying the business turned from a mad gamble into a cheeky bonus in a matter of weeks. In June, Tesla announced, to much fanfare, that it would share its charging points with General Motors to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles. This was dressed up as a typical piece of quirky Muskian philanthropy. But as various commentators on his timeline pointed out, on the day the announcement was made the market capitalisation of Tesla increased by more than the total net worth of GM. Just 50 years ago, GM employed 700,000 people in the US alone. Now it’s a plaything for Musk to message his concern about the future. And still he keeps getting richer. It’s a world turned upside down. Upbeat apocalypticism is also the outlook of many of the accounts he follows. For instance, ZeroHedge – a libertarian, rightwing blog put together by the Bulgarian ex-banker Daniel Ivandjiiski – has as its motto a line from Fight Club: “On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.” ZeroHedge sees looming disaster everywhere – rampant inflation, the collapse of fiat money, bubbles bursting, unhinged liberalism eating into the fabric of society. Yet at the same time, its tone suggests what fun it’s all going to be: not only to be proved right but think of all the money to be made as the world ends. Musk is similarly short on pretty much everything – democracy, Europe, universities, the dollar – except intelligence, and even there he’s worried about what’s coming with AI. But he can’t resist a well-engineered machine. He likes to follow accounts that post pictures of cool-looking stuff (this is a world where “cool” is the ultimate term of approbation): weird buildings, curious patterns in nature, pleasingly shaped gadgets (Victorian pencil sharpeners, blown-glass ornaments) and lots and lots of images of space (Black Hole is a particular favourite). He follows accounts called How Things Work and Oddly Satisfying. His engagement with all this information is overwhelmingly visual: his use of words is usually laconic to the point of incoherence – and in interviews he struggles to complete his sentences and is often repetitive – but he just loves looking at arresting images. Essentially, his tastes are torn between the classical and the futuristic. Musk divides human experience in two: the past is primarily aesthetic, the future is overwhelmingly algorithmic. That means much of western Europe exists for Musk as a kind of glorified heritage park (unless he can build another Tesla gigafactory there). Every day someone on his Twitter feed will post a picture of a French chateau, or Roman temple, or Cistercian abbey, or Oxbridge college, and express themselves awestruck by its beauty. For Musk, an Oxbridge college and a Roman temple belong in the same category: a gorgeous and essentially moribund relic of the past. The UK in particular features in the Muskian outlook as a place whose time has been and gone. We are churches, thatched cottages, red pillar boxes. It’s like the episode of Friends when they came to London: nothing but a backdrop for a story that doesn’t concern us. The only exceptions to this are, first, the Royal Society, which Musk seems to respect (Britain still has some cool scientists) and the Guardian, which he sometimes notices publishing things he really doesn’t like. When he came across a retweet on 9 July of a Guardian article titled A eulogy for Twitter, he responded: “‘The Guardian’ specializes in laboriously pedantic propaganda.” For someone who says he’s on Twitter to have his worldview challenged, he’s not that keen on having his worldview challenged. Following Musk’s timeline helps build up a picture of how the world looks from inside his head. It’s like the old New Yorker cartoon View of the World from 9th Avenue, in which 10th Avenue looms large, the rest of the US small, and the rest of the world barely gets a look in. But this one doesn’t feature New York. For Musk, nowhere in the US looms very large, nor does much of the rest of the planet. Sometimes he notices China, or India, but most of the time he sees only what’s in front of his face, or what’s well beyond other people’s ken. Tesla factories are big, but there’s not much else that stands out before we reach outer space. Everything in between feels oddly insubstantial – there is, for instance, a lot of Ricky Gervais talking about the difference between dogs and cats. Between the here and now and a future that exists beyond anything we would currently recognise, Musk doesn’t really have a point of view. He is extraordinarily present and almost impossibly remote. He is clearly a genius and he is also a fool. He is the spirit of the age.  David Runciman is professor of politics at Cambridge University.

His over-riding mission had always been to assure that AI developed in a way that helped guarantee that human consciousness endured. That was ...","At a conference in 2012, Elon Musk met Demis Hassabis, the video-game designer and artificial--intelligence researcher who had co-founded a company named DeepMind that sought to design computers that could learn how to think like humans. “Elon and I hit it off right away, and I went to visit him at his rocket factory,” Hassabis says. While sitting in the canteen overlooking the assembly lines, Musk explained that his reason for building rockets that could go to Mars was that it might be a way to preserve human consciousness in the event of a world war, asteroid strike, or civilization collapse. Hassabis told him to add another potential threat to the list: artificial intelligence. Machines could become superintelligent and surpass us mere mortals, -perhaps even decide to dispose of us.  Musk paused silently for almost a minute as he processed this possibility. He decided that Hassabis might be right about the danger of AI, and promptly invested $5 million in DeepMind as a way to monitor what it was doing. A few weeks after this conversation with Hassabis, Musk described DeepMind to Google’s Larry Page. They had known each other for more than a decade, and Musk often stayed at Page’s Palo Alto, Calif., house. The potential dangers of artificial intelligence became a topic that Musk would raise, almost obsessively, during their late-night conversations. Page was dismissive. At Musk’s 2013 birthday party in Napa Valley, California, they got into a passionate debate. Unless we built in safeguards, Musk argued, artificial-intelligence-systems might replace humans, making our species irrelevant or even extinct. Page pushed back. Why would it matter, he asked, if machines someday surpassed humans in intelligence, even consciousness? It would simply be the next stage of evolution. Human consciousness, Musk retorted, was a precious flicker of light in the universe, and we should not let it be extinguished. Page considered that sentimental nonsense. If consciousness could be replicated in a machine, why would that not be just as valuable? He accused Musk of being a “specist,” someone who was biased in favor of their own species. “Well, yes, I am pro-human,” Musk responded. “I f-cking like humanity, dude.” Musk was therefore dismayed when he heard at the end of 2013 that Page and Google were planning to buy DeepMind. Musk and his friend Luke Nosek tried to put together financing to stop the deal. At a party in Los Angeles, they went to an upstairs closet for an hour-long Skype call with Hassabis. “The future of AI should not be controlled by Larry,” Musk told him. The effort failed, and Google’s -acquisition of DeepMind was announced in January 2014. Page initially agreed to create a “safety council,” with Musk as a member. The first and only meeting was held at SpaceX. Page, Hassabis, and Google chair Eric Schmidt attended, along with Reid Hoffman and a few others. Musk concluded that the council was basically bullsh-t. So Musk began hosting his own series of dinner discussions on ways to counter Google and promote AI safety. He even reached out to President Obama, who agreed to a one-on-one meeting in May 2015. Musk explained the risk and suggested that it be regulated. “Obama got it,” Musk says. “But I realized that it was not going to rise to the level of something that he would do anything about.” Musk then turned to Sam Altman, a tightly bundled software entrepreneur, sports-car enthusiast, and survivalist who, behind his polished veneer, had a Musk-like intensity. At a small dinner in Palo Alto, they decided to co-found a nonprofit artificial-intelligence-research lab, which they named OpenAI. It would make its software open-source and try to counter Google’s growing dominance of the field. “We wanted to have something like a Linux version of AI that was not controlled by any one person or corporation,” Musk says.  One question they discussed at dinner was what would be safer: a small number of AI systems that were controlled by big corporations or a large number of independent systems? They concluded that a large number of competing systems, providing checks and balances on one another, was better. For Musk, this was the reason to make OpenAI truly open, so that lots of people could build systems based on its source code.  Another way to assure AI safety, Musk felt, was to tie the bots closely to humans. They should be an extension of the will of individuals, rather than systems that could go rogue and develop their own goals and intentions. That would become one of the rationales for Neuralink, the company he would found to create chips that could connect human brains directly to computers. Musk’s determination to develop artificial-intelligence capabilities at his own companies caused a break with OpenAI in 2018. He tried to convince Altman that OpenAI should be folded into Tesla. The OpenAI team rejected that idea, and Altman stepped in as president of the lab, starting a for-profit arm that was able to raise equity funding, including a major investment from Microsoft. So Musk decided to forge ahead with building rival AI teams to work on an array of related projects. These included Neuralink, which aims to plant microchips in human brains; Optimus, a human-like robot; and Dojo, a supercomputer that can use millions of videos to train an artificial neural network to simulate a human brain. It also spurred him to become obsessed with pushing to make Tesla cars self-driving.  At first these endeavors were rather independent, but eventually Musk would tie them all together, along with a new company he founded called xAI, to pursue the goal of artificial general intelligence. In March 2023, OpenAI released GPT-4 to the public. Google then released a rival chatbot named Bard. The stage was thus set for a competition between OpenAI-Microsoft and DeepMind-Google to create products that could chat with humans in a natural way and perform an endless array of text-based intellectual tasks. Musk worried that these chatbots and AI systems, especially in the hands of Microsoft and Google, could become politically indoctrinated, perhaps even infected by what he called the woke-mind virus. He also feared that self-learning AI systems might turn hostile to the human species. And on a more immediate level, he worried that chatbots could be trained to flood Twitter with disinformation, biased reporting, and financial scams. All of those things were already being done by humans, of course. But the ability to deploy thousands of weaponized chatbots would make the problem two or three orders of magnitude worse. His compulsion to ride to the rescue kicked in. He was resentful that he had founded and funded OpenAI but was now left out of the fray. AI was the biggest storm brewing. And there was no one more attracted to a storm than Musk. In February 2023, he invited—perhaps a better word is summoned—Sam Altman to meet with him at Twitter and asked him to bring the founding documents for OpenAI. Musk challenged him to justify how he could legally transform a nonprofit funded by donations into a for-profit that could make millions. Altman tried to show that it was all legitimate, and he insisted that he personally was not a shareholder or cashing in. He also offered Musk shares in the new company, which Musk declined. Instead, Musk unleashed a barrage of attacks on OpenAI. Altman was pained. Unlike Musk, he is sensitive and nonconfrontational. He felt that Musk had not drilled down enough into the complexity of the issue of AI safety. However, he did feel that Musk’s criticisms came from a sincere concern. “He’s a jerk,” Altman told Kara Swisher. “He has a style that is not a style that I’d want to have for myself. But I think he does really care, and he is feeling very stressed about what the future’s going to look like for humanity.” The fuel for AI is data. The new chatbots were being trained on massive amounts of information, such as billions of pages on the internet and other documents. Google and Microsoft, with their search engines and cloud services and access to emails, had huge gushers of data to help train these systems. What could Musk bring to the party? One asset was the Twitter feed, which included more than a trillion tweets posted over the years, 500 million added each day. It was humanity’s hive mind, the world’s most timely dataset of real-life human conversations, news, interests, trends, arguments, and lingo. Plus it was a great training ground for a chatbot to test how real humans react to its responses. The value of this data feed was not something Musk considered when buying Twitter. “It was a side benefit, actually, that I realized only after the purchase,” he says. Twitter had rather loosely permitted other companies to make use of this data stream. In January 2023, Musk convened a series of late-night meetings in his Twitter conference room to work out ways to charge for it. “It’s a monetization opportunity,” he told the engineers. It was also a way to restrict Google and Microsoft from using this data to improve their AI chatbots. He ignited a controversy in July when he decided to temporarily restrict the number of tweets a viewer could see per day; the goal was to prevent Google and Microsoft from “scraping” up millions of tweets to use as data to train their AI systems.  There was another data trove that Musk had: the 160 billion frames per day of video that Tesla received and processed from the cameras on its cars. This data was different from the text-based documents that informed chatbots. It was video data of humans navigating in real-world situations. It could help create AI for physical robots, not just text-generating chatbots. The holy grail of artificial general intelligence is building machines that can operate like humans in physical spaces, such as factories and offices and on the surface of Mars, not just wow us with disembodied chatting. Tesla and Twitter together could provide the datasets and the processing capability for both approaches: teaching machines to navigate in physical space and to answer questions in natural language. This past March, Musk texted me, “There are a few important things I would like to talk to you about. Can only be done in person.” When I got to Austin, he was at the house of Shivon Zilis, the Neuralink executive who was the mother of two of his children and who had been his intellectual companion on artificial intelligence since the founding of OpenAI eight years earlier. He said we should leave our phones in the house while we sat outside, because, he said, someone could use them to monitor our conversation. But he later agreed that I could use what he said about AI in my book. He and Zilis sat cross-legged and barefoot on the poolside patio with their twins, Strider and Azure, now 16 months old, on their laps. Zilis made coffee and then put his in the microwave to get it superhot so he wouldn’t chug it too fast. “What can be done to make AI safe?” Musk asked. “I keep wrestling with that. What actions can we take to minimize AI danger and assure that human consciousness survives?” He spoke in a low monotone punctuated by bouts of almost manic laughter. The amount of human intelligence, he noted, was leveling off, because people were not having enough children. Meanwhile, the amount of computer intelligence was going up exponentially, like Moore’s Law on steroids. At some point, biological brainpower would be dwarfed by digital brainpower. In addition, new AI machine-learning systems could ingest information on their own and teach -themselves how to generate outputs, even upgrade their own code and capabilities. The term singularity was used by the mathematician John von Neumann and the sci-fi writer Vernor Vinge to describe the moment when artificial intelligence could forge ahead on its own at an uncontrollable pace and leave us mere humans behind. “That could happen sooner than we expected,” Musk said in an ominous tone. For a moment I was struck by the oddness of the scene. We were sitting on a suburban patio by a tranquil backyard swimming pool on a sunny spring day, with two bright-eyed twins learning to toddle, as Musk somberly speculated about the window of opportunity for building a sustainable human colony on Mars before an AI apocalypse destroyed earthly civilization.  Musk lapsed into one of his long silences. He was, as Zilis called it, “batch processing,” referring to the way an old-fashioned computer would cue up a number of tasks and run them sequentially when it had enough processing power available. “I can’t just sit around and do nothing,” he finally said softly. “With AI coming, I’m sort of wondering whether it’s worth spending that much time thinking about Twitter. Sure, I could probably make it the biggest financial institution in the world. But I have only so many brain cycles and hours in the day. I mean, it’s not like I need to be richer or something.” I started to speak, but he knew what I was going to ask. “So what should my time be spent on?” he said. “Getting Starship launched. Getting to Mars is now far more pressing.” He paused again, then added, “Also, I need to focus on making AI safe. That’s why I’m starting an AI company.” This is the company Musk dubbed xAI. He personally recruited Igor Babuschkin, formerly of DeepMind, but he told me he would run it himself. I calculated that would mean he would be running six companies: Tesla, SpaceX and its Starlink unit, Twitter, the Boring Co., Neuralink, and xAI. That was three times as many as Steve Jobs (Apple, Pixar) at his peak. He admitted that he was starting off way behind OpenAI in creating a chatbot that could give natural-language -responses to questions. But Tesla’s work on self-driving cars and Optimus the robot put it way ahead in creating the type of AI needed to navigate in the physical world. This meant that his engineers were actually ahead of OpenAI in creating full-fledged artificial general intelligence, which requires both abilities. “Tesla’s real-world AI is underrated,” he said. “Imagine if Tesla and OpenAI had to swap tasks. They would have to make self-driving, and we would have to make large-language-model chatbots. Who wins? We do.” In April, Musk assigned Babuschkin and his team three major goals. The first was to make an AI bot that could write computer code. A programmer could begin typing in any coding language, and the xAI bot would auto-complete the task for the most likely action they were trying to take. The second product would be a chatbot competitor to Open-AI’s GPT series, one that used algorithms and trained on datasets that would ensure its political neutrality. The third goal that Musk gave the team was even grander. His over-riding mission had always been to assure that AI developed in a way that helped guarantee that human consciousness endured. That was best achieved, he thought, by creating a form of artificial general intelligence that could “reason” and “think” and pursue “truth” as its guiding principle. You should be able to give it big tasks, like “Build a better rocket engine.” Someday, Musk hoped, it would be able to take on even grander and more existential questions. It would be “a maximum truth-seeking AI. It would care about understanding the universe, and that would probably lead it to want to preserve humanity, because we are an interesting part of the universe.” That sounded vaguely familiar, and then I realized why.  He was embarking on a mission similar to the one chronicled in the formative (perhaps too formative?) bible of his childhood years, the one that pulled him out of his adolescent existential depression, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which featured a super-computer designed to figure out “the Answer to The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.” Isaacson, former editor of TIME, is a professor of history at Tulane and the author of numerous acclaimed biographies.

Haldeman, whose political writing supported South African apartheid and promoted antisemitic ...","To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories Find anything you save across the site in your account  By Jill Lepore This month, Elon Musk threatened to sue the Anti-Defamation League, alleging that its denunciation of X—the A.D.L. had accused the social-media platform formerly known as Twitter of amplifying antisemitism—has cost Musk’s company a fortune in advertising revenue. The Anti-Defamation League, in turn, asserted that Musk’s threat was “dangerous and deeply irresponsible.” This week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to California to meet with Musk to discuss artificial intelligence, but their other much-anticipated topic was antisemitism. Netanyahu asked Musk to “stop antisemitism as best you can.” Musk, alluding to SpaceX and his hope for a mission to Mars, responded that he favors anything that “ultimately leads us to become a spacefaring civilization,” and, since hate hinders that mission, “obviously, I’m against antisemitism.” This all unfolded amid the release of Walter Isaacson’s new biography of Musk. Musk’s family history has a bearing on the dispute, but, in the book, as I pointed out in a review, Isaacson only glancingly discusses Musk’s grandfather J. N. Haldeman, whom he presents as a risk-taking adventurer and whose politics he dismisses as “quirky.” In fact, Haldeman was a pro-apartheid, antisemitic conspiracy theorist who blamed much of what bothered him about the world on Jewish financiers. Elon Musk is not responsible for the political opinions of his grandfather, who died when Musk was three years old. But Haldeman’s legacy casts light on what social media does: the reason that most people don’t know about Musk’s grandfather’s political writings is that in his lifetime social media did not exist, and the writings of people like him were not, therefore, amplified by it. Indeed, they were very unlikely to circulate widely, and are now quite rare. Still, they’re not hard to find, which makes it unfortunate that Isaacson neither quotes from nor mentions them. Musk has said that he bought Twitter to halt the advance of a “woke mind virus” spreading online. His grandfather wrote his tracts to raise an alarm about what he called “mind control,” on the radio and television, where “an unconditional propaganda warfare is carried on against the White man.” Haldeman was born in Minnesota in 1902 but grew up mostly in Saskatchewan, Canada. A daredevil aviator and sometime cowboy, he also trained and worked as a chiropractor. In the nineteen-thirties, he joined the quasi-fascistic Technocracy movement, whose proponents believed that scientists and engineers, rather than the people, should rule. He became a leader of the movement in Canada, and, when it was briefly outlawed, he was jailed, after which he became the national chairman of what was then a notoriously antisemitic party called Social Credit. In the nineteen-forties, he ran for office under its banner, and lost. In 1950, two years after South Africa instituted apartheid, he moved his family to Pretoria, where he became an impassioned defender of the regime. Before the age of the Internet, the writings of political extremists tended to be privately published, in quite small numbers. An angry man typing out memos about an invisible world government might make a few mimeographs or carbon copies, but the chance that any ended up in a library, catalogued and preserved, is slight. Presumably, most of Haldeman’s papers remain in family hands, if they have not been destroyed. But some of his writing survives, including in the Michigan State University library’s extraordinary Radicalism Collection. In 2017, the collection acquired two of Haldeman’s tracts, as part of a trove from an anonymous donor which has now grown to nineteen thousand pieces of right-wing propaganda and conspiracy literature. One of the Haldeman tracts, “The International Conspiracy to Establish a World Dictatorship and the Menace to South Africa,” is dated May, 1960. The timing is significant. In February, 1960, Harold Macmillan, the British Prime Minister, delivered his famous “Wind of Change” speech to the South African Parliament, discountenancing apartheid and urging acceptance of independence movements: “The wind of change is blowing through this continent, and, whether we like it or not, this growth of national consciousness is a political fact.” In March, South African police opened fire on a crowd of thousands of Black South Africans protesting outside the Sharpeville police station, killing sixty-nine people, including children, and wounding nearly two hundred. The killings were captured on television and the coverage reached around the world. In the ensuing protests and state of emergency, Nelson Mandela was among eighteen thousand people arrested and jailed. Haldeman’s tracts defended white rule against an “international conspiracy” that opposed it. “Every day the brain-washers repeat and emphasize the things they want us to believe,” Haldeman warned in his forty-two-page May, 1960, tract. “As examples ‘The Natives are ill-treated,’ ‘underpaid,’ ‘underprivileged,’ ‘separate development is wrong,’ ‘apartheid is un-Christian.’ Every day newspapers, magazines, commercial radio newscasters, bioscopes, din this into the conscious and subconscious minds of the public.” (“Bioscopes,” here, means motion pictures.) “People who know it is 99% untrue repeat these lies emphatically and emotionally,” Haldeman wrote. Haldeman railed against many dark forces that he believed to be propagating these ideas: Jewish bankers, Jewish intellectuals, philanthropic foundations run by Jews, communists, Black leaders, and anyone who supported the overthrow of colonial rule in Africa. “The facts of history show that the White man has always developed the country he inhabits to the benefit of all concerned,” he wrote, peddling stock apartheid propaganda, and “The Black people of Africa have been in close contact with civilization from the earliest times but, on their own, built nothing and discovered nothing, not even the wheel.” In the second tract that M.S.U. holds, “The International Conspiracy in Health,” Haldeman blamed the “collectivist-internationalist” conspiracy—“from Kennedy to Kenyatta”—for “centralized health schemes” that include national health insurance and various pharmaceuticals (including fluoride in the water, another conspiracy), all of which he considered “anti-Christian infringements on human liberties.” If some people were not alarmed by all of this, he wrote, it was because of mind control. “When a Christian subscribes to this, it is the result of the concentrated, intentional brain-washing done by the International Conspiracy.” Submitting to national health care was one way the conspirators were allowing “Black or Coloured political puppets” to take “control of responsible White people.” The Conspiracy, he warned, controls universities, medical schools, and even textbooks. “The Conspiracy feels that any medical intervention, so long as it is in mass, is a desirable procedure.” Above all, “The promoters of World Government have always been behind mass vaccination programmes.” Aside from these two tracts, a rare-books dealer earlier this month sold an issue, No. 5, of a newsletter called Survival (“For Adults Only”) that he attributes to Haldeman. (The author’s name, the dealer reports, appears on the back page.) In the issue, published sometime after January, 1962, the writer represented the growing independence movements across African nations as a “WORLD GONE MAD.” “Throughout the so-called African Independent States there is complete chaos,” he wrote. “The population is reduced to starvation and cannibalism approaching what it was before the arrival of the White man.” He described the Mau Mau as engaging in a rite that required an initiate “to suck the dismembered penis of some other unfortunate victim of Mau Mau.” He denounced Israel, for having “consistently voted against South Africa in the United Nations.” But, in any case, he explained, the U.N. was riddled with communist spies. Haldeman typed his tracts, presumably on his own typewriter. He might have made dozens of copies, or maybe hundreds, but not likely many more. He might have sent them out by mail or handed them out at political gatherings or church meetings or men’s groups. They were read, in any event, by a handful of South Africans in and near Pretoria, and possibly also by like-minded people farther afield. And then they very nearly disappeared. But if Haldeman were writing today, he’d likely be distributing his ideas on Facebook and YouTube and Twitter and Reddit and 4chan and more. Algorithms would deliver them to thousands and possibly millions of people. He would find an audience. He would become bolder. He would find a bigger audience. He would become bolder still. Elon Musk’s grandfather’s political views are not Musk’s responsibility. But what would happen to those rantings, if they were posted on X today, really does lie at his doorstep. ♦ First she scandalized Washington. Then she became a princess.

He dreams of Mars as he bestrides Earth ...","To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved stories Find anything you save across the site in your account  By Jill Lepore In 2021, Elon Musk became the world’s richest man (no woman came close), and Time named him Person of the Year: “This is the man who aspires to save our planet and get us a new one to inhabit: clown, genius, edgelord, visionary, industrialist, showman, cad; a madcap hybrid of Thomas Edison, P. T. Barnum, Andrew Carnegie and Watchmen’s Doctor Manhattan, the brooding, blue-skinned man-god who invents electric cars and moves to Mars.” Right about when Time was preparing that giddy announcement, three women whose ovaries and uteruses were involved in passing down the madcap man-god’s genes were in the maternity ward of a hospital in Austin. Musk believes a declining birth rate is a threat to civilization and, with his trademark tirelessness, is doing his visionary edgelord best to ward off that threat. Shivon Zilis, a thirty-five-year-old venture capitalist and executive at Musk’s company Neuralink, was pregnant with twins, conceived with Musk by in-vitro fertilization, and was experiencing complications. “He really wants smart people to have kids, so he encouraged me to,” Zilis said. In a nearby room, a woman serving as a surrogate for Musk and his thirty-three-year-old ex-wife, Claire Boucher, a musician better known as Grimes, was suffering from pregnancy complications, too, and Grimes was staying with her. “I really wanted him to have a daughter so bad,” Grimes said. At the time, Musk had had seven sons, including, with Grimes, a child named X. Grimes did not know that Zilis, a friend of hers, was down the hall, or that Zilis was pregnant by Musk. Zilis’s twins were born seven weeks premature; the surrogate delivered safely a few weeks later. In mid-December, Grimes’s new baby came home and met her brother X. An hour later, Musk took X to New York and dandled him on his knee while being photographed for Time. “He dreams of Mars as he bestrides Earth, square-jawed and indomitable,” the magazine’s Person of the Year announcement read. Musk and Grimes called the baby, Musk’s tenth, Y, or sometimes “Why?,” or just “?”—a reference to Musk’s favorite book, Douglas Adams’s “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” because, Grimes explained, it’s a book about how knowing the question is more important than knowing the answer. Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday. Elon Musk is currently at or near the helm of six companies: Tesla, SpaceX (which includes Starlink), the Boring Company, Neuralink, X (formerly known as Twitter), and X.AI, an artificial-intelligence company that he founded, earlier this year, because he believes that human intelligence isn’t reproducing fast enough, while artificial intelligence is getting more artificially intelligent exponentially. Call it Musk’s Law: the answer to killer robots is more Musk babies. Plus, more Musk companies. “I can’t just sit around and do nothing,” Musk says, fretting about A.I., in Walter Isaacson’s new biography, “Elon Musk” (Simon & Schuster), a book that can scarcely contain its subject, in that it raises infinitely more questions than it answers. “Are you sincerely trying to save the world?” Stephen Colbert once asked Musk on “The Late Show.” “Well, I’m trying to do good things, yeah, saving the world is not, I mean . . . ,” Musk said, mumbling. “But you’re trying to do good things, and you’re a billionaire,” Colbert interrupted. “Yeah,” Musk said, nodding. Colbert said, “That seems a little like superhero or supervillain. You have to choose one.” Musk paused, his face blank. That was eight years, several companies, and as many children ago. Things have got a lot weirder since. More Lex Luthor, less Tony Stark. Musk controls the very tiniest things, and the very biggest. He oversees companies, valued at more than a trillion dollars, whose engineers have built or are building, among other things, reusable rocket ships, a humanoid robot, hyperloops for rapid transit, and a man-machine interface to be implanted in human brains. He is an entrepreneur, a media mogul, a political provocateur, and, not least, a defense contractor: SpaceX has received not only billions of dollars in government contracts for space missions but also more than a hundred million dollars in military contracts for missile-tracking satellites, and Starlink’s network of four thousand satellites—which provides Pentagon-funded services to Ukraine—now offers a military service called Starshield. Day by day, Musk’s companies control more of the Internet, the power grid, the transportation system, objects in orbit, the nation’s security infrastructure, and its energy supply. And yet. At a jury trial earlier this year, Musk’s lawyer repeatedly referred to his client, a middle-aged man, as a “kid.” The Wall Street Journal has described him as suffering from “tantrums.” The Independent has alleged that selling Twitter to Musk was “like handing a toddler a loaded gun.” “I’m not evil,” Musk said on “Saturday Night Live” a couple of years ago, playing the dastardly Nintendo villain Wario, on trial for murdering Mario. “I’m just misunderstood.” How does a biographer begin to write about such a man? Some years back, after Isaacson had published a biography of Benjamin Franklin and was known to be writing one of Albert Einstein, the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs called him up and asked him to write his biography; Isaacson says he wondered, half jokingly, whether Jobs “saw himself as the natural successor in that sequence.” I don’t think Musk sees himself as a natural successor to anyone. As I read it, Isaacson found much to like and admire in Jobs but is decidedly uncomfortable with Musk. (He calls him, at one point, “an asshole.”) Still, Isaacson’s descriptions of Jobs and Musk are often interchangeable. “His passions, perfectionism, demons, desires, artistry, devilry, and obsession for control were integrally connected to his approach to business and the products that resulted.” (That’s Jobs.) “It was in his nature to want total control.” (Musk.) “He didn’t have the emotional receptors that produce everyday kindness and warmth and a desire to be liked.” (Musk.) “He was not a model boss or human being.” (Jobs.) “This is a book about the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries.” I ask you: Which? “Sometimes great innovators are risk-seeking man-children who resist potty training,” Isaacson concludes in the last lines of his life of Musk. “They can be reckless, cringeworthy, sometimes even toxic. They can also be crazy. Crazy enough to think they can change the world.” It’s a disconcerting thing to read on page 615 of a biography of a fifty-two-year-old man about whom a case could be made that he wields more power than any other person on the planet who isn’t in charge of a nuclear arsenal. Not potty-trained? Boys will be . . . toddlers? Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, in 1971. His grandfather J. N. Haldeman was a staunch anti-Communist from Canada who in the nineteen-thirties and forties had been a leader of the anti-democratic and quasi-fascist Technocracy movement. (Technocrats believed that scientists and engineers should rule.) “In 1950, he decided to move to South Africa,” Isaacson writes, “which was still ruled by a white apartheid regime.” In fact, apartheid had been declared only in 1948, and the regime was soon recruiting white settlers from North America, promising restless men such as Haldeman that they could live like princes. Isaacson calls Haldeman’s politics “quirky.” In 1960, Haldeman self-published a tract, “The International Conspiracy to Establish a World Dictatorship & the Menace to South Africa,” that blamed the two World Wars on the machinations of Jewish financiers. Musk’s mother, Maye Haldeman, was a finalist for Miss South Africa during her tumultuous courtship with his father, Errol Musk, an engineer and an aviator. In 2019, she published a memoir titled “A Woman Makes a Plan: Advice for a Lifetime of Adventure, Beauty, and Success.” For all that she writes about growing up in South Africa in the nineteen-fifties and sixties, she never once mentions apartheid. Isaacson, in his account of Elon Musk’s childhood, barely mentions apartheid himself. He writes at length and with compassion about the indignities heaped upon young Elon by schoolmates. Elon, an awkward, lonely boy, was bored in school and had a tendency to call other kids “stupid”; he was also very often beaten up, and his father frequently berated him, but when he was ten, a few years after his parents divorced, he chose to live with him. (Musk is now estranged from his father, a conspiracist who has called Joe Biden a “pedophile President,” and who has two children by his own stepdaughter; he has said that “the only thing we are here for is to reproduce.” Recently, he warned Elon, in an e-mail, that “with no Whites here, the Blacks will go back to the trees.”) Link copied Musk’s childhood sounds bad, but Isaacson’s telling leaves out rather a lot about the world in which Musk grew up. In the South Africa of “Elon Musk,” there are Musks and Haldemans—Elon and his younger brother and sister and his many cousins—and there are animals, including the elephants and monkeys who prove to be a nuisance at a construction project of Errol’s. There are no other people, and there are certainly no Black people, the nannies, cooks, gardeners, cleaners, and construction workers who built, for white South Africans, a fantasy world. And so, for instance, we don’t learn that in 1976, when Elon was four, some twenty thousand Black schoolchildren in Soweto staged a protest and heavily armed police killed as many as seven hundred. Instead, we’re told, “As a kid growing up in South Africa, Elon Musk knew pain and learned how to survive it.” Musk, the boy, loved video games and computers and Dungeons & Dragons and “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” and he still does. “I took from the book that we need to extend the scope of consciousness so that we are better able to ask the questions about the answer, which is the universe,” Musk tells Isaacson. Isaacson doesn’t raise an eyebrow, and you can wonder whether he has read “Hitchhiker’s Guide,” or listened to the BBC 4 radio play on which it is based, first broadcast in 1978. It sounds like this: Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days of the former galactic empire, life was wild, rich, and, on the whole, tax free. . . . Many men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly natural because no one was really poor, at least, no one worth speaking of. “The Hitchhiker’s Guide” is not a book about how “we need to extend the scope of consciousness so that we are better able to ask the questions about the answer, which is the universe.” It is, among other things, a razor-sharp satiric indictment of imperialism: And for these extremely rich merchants life eventually became rather dull, and it seemed that none of the worlds they settled on was entirely satisfactory. Either the climate wasn’t quite right in the later part of the afternoon or the day was half an hour too long or the sea was just the wrong shade of pink. And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of industry: custom-made, luxury planet-building. Douglas Adams wrote “The Hitchhiker’s Guide” on a typewriter that had on its side a sticker that read “End Apartheid.” He wasn’t crafting an instruction manual for mega-rich luxury planet builders. Biographers don’t generally have a will to power. Robert Caro is not Robert Moses and would seem to have very little in common with Lyndon the “B” is for “bastard” Johnson. Walter Isaacson is a gracious, generous, public-spirited man and a principled biographer. This year, he was presented with the National Humanities Medal. But, as a former editor of Time and a former C.E.O. of CNN and of the Aspen Institute, Isaacson also has an executive’s affinity for the C-suite, which would seem to make it a challenge to keep a certain distance from the world view of his subject. Isaacson shadowed Musk for two years and interviewed dozens of people, but they tend to have titles like C.E.O., C.F.O., president, V.P., and founder. The book upholds a core conviction of many executives: sometimes to get shit done you have to be a dick. He dreams of Mars as he bestrides Earth, square-jawed and indomitable. For the rest of us, Musk’s pettiness, arrogance, and swaggering viciousness are harder to take, and their necessity less clear. Isaacson is interested in how innovation happens. In addition to biographies of Franklin, Einstein, Jobs, and Leonardo da Vinci, he has also written about figures in the digital revolution and in gene editing. Isaacson puts innovation first: This man might be a monster, but look at what he built! Whereas Mary Shelley, for instance, put innovation second: The man who built this is a monster! The political theorist Judith Shklar once wrote an essay called “Putting Cruelty First.” Montaigne put cruelty first, identifying it as the worst thing people do; Machiavelli did not. As for “the usual excuse for our most unspeakable public acts,” the excuse “that they are necessary,” Shklar knew this to be nonsense. “Much of what passed under these names was merely princely wilfulness,” as Shklar put it. This is always the problem with princes. Elon Musk started college at the University of Pretoria but left South Africa in 1989, at seventeen. He went first to Canada and, after two years at Queen’s University in Ontario, transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied physics and economics, and wrote a senior paper titled “The Importance of Being Solar.” He had done internships in Silicon Valley and, after graduating, enrolled in a Ph.D. program in materials science at Stanford, but he deferred admission and never went. It was 1995, the year the Internet opened to commercial traffic. All around him, frogs were turning into princes. He wanted to start a startup. Musk and his brother Kimball, with money from their parents, launched Zip2, an early online Yellow Pages that sold its services to newspaper publishers. In 1999, during the dot-com boom, they sold it to Compaq for more than three hundred million dollars. Musk, with his share of the money, launched one of the earliest online banking companies. He called it X.com. “I think X.com could absolutely be a multibillion-dollar bonanza,” he told CNN, but, meanwhile, “I’d like to be on the cover of Rolling Stone.” That would have to wait for a few years, but in 1999 Salon announced, “Elon Musk Is Poised to Become Silicon Valley’s Next Big Thing,” in a profile that advanced what was already a hackneyed set of journalistic conventions about the man-boy man-gods of Northern California: “The showiness, the chutzpah, the streak of self-promotion and the urge to create a dramatic public persona are major elements of what makes up the Silicon Valley entrepreneur. . . . Musk’s ego has gotten him in trouble before, and it may get him in trouble again, yet it is also part and parcel of what it means to be a hotshot entrepreneur.” Five months later, Musk married his college girlfriend, Justine Wilson. During their first dance at their wedding, he whispered in her ear, “I am the alpha in this relationship.” “Big Ego of Hotshot Entrepreneur Gets Him Into Trouble” is more or less the running headline of Musk’s life. In 2000, Peter Thiel’s company Confinity merged with X.com, and Musk regretted that the new company was called PayPal, instead of X. (He later bought the domain x.com, and for years he kept it as a kind of shrine, a blank white page with nothing but a tiny letter “x” on the screen.) In 2002, eBay paid $1.5 billion for the company, and Musk drew on his share of the sale to start SpaceX. Two years later, he invested around $6.5 million in Tesla; he became both its largest shareholder and its chairman. Around then, in his Marvel Iron Man phase, Musk left Northern California for Los Angeles, to swan with starlets. Courted by Ted Cruz during COVID, he moved to Texas, because he dislikes regulation, and because he objected to California’s lockdowns and mask mandates. Musk’s accomplishments as the head of a series of pioneering engineering firms are unrivalled. Isaacson takes on each of Musk’s ventures, venture by venture, chapter by chapter, emphasizing the ferocity and the velocity and the effectiveness of Musk’s management style—“A maniacal sense of urgency is our operating principles” is a workplace rule. “How the fuck can it take so long?” Musk asked an engineer working on SpaceX’s Merlin engines. “This is stupid. Cut it in half.” He pushed SpaceX through years of failures, crash after crash, with the confidence that success would come. “Until today, all electric cars sucked,” Musk said, launching Tesla’s Roadster, leaving every other electric car and most gas cars in the dust. No automotive company had broken into that industry in something like a century. Like SpaceX, Tesla went through very hard times. Musk steered it to triumph, a miracle amid fossil fuel’s stranglehold. “Fuck oil,” he said. “Comradery is dangerous” is another of Musk’s workplace maxims. He was ousted as PayPal’s C.E.O. and ousted as Tesla’s chairman. He’s opposed to unions, pushed workers back to the Tesla plants at the height of the Covid pandemic—some four hundred and fifty reportedly got infected—and has thwarted workers’ rights at every turn. Musk has run through companies and he has run through wives. In some families, domestic relations are just another kind of labor relations. He pushed his first wife, Justine, to dye her hair blonder. After they lost their firstborn son, Nevada, in infancy, Justine gave birth to twins (one of whom they named Xavier, in part for Professor Xavier, from “X-Men”) and then to triplets. When the couple fought, he told her, “If you were my employee, I would fire you.” He divorced her and soon proposed to Talulah Riley, a twenty-two-year-old British actress who had only just moved out of her parents’ house. She said her job was to stop Musk from going “king-crazy”: “People become king, and then they go crazy.” They married, divorced, married, and divorced. But “you’re my Mr. Rochester,” she told him. “And if Thornfield Hall burns down and you are blind, I’ll come and take care of you.” He dated Amber Heard, after her separation from Johnny Depp. Then he met Grimes. “I’m just a fool for love,” Musk tells Isaacson. “I am often a fool, but especially for love.” He is also a fool for Twitter. His Twitter account first got him into real trouble in 2018, when he baselessly called a British diver, who helped rescue Thai children trapped in a flooded cave, a “pedo” and was sued for defamation. That same year, he tweeted, “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420,” making a pot joke. “Funding secured.” (“I kill me,” he says about his sense of humor.) The S.E.C. charged him with fraud, and Tesla stock fell more than thirteen per cent. Tesla shareholders sued him, alleging that his tweets had caused their stock to lose value. On Joe Rogan’s podcast, he went king-crazy, lighting up a joint. He looked at his phone. “You getting text messages from chicks?” Rogan asked. “I’m getting text messages from friends saying, ‘What the hell are you doing smoking weed?’ ” “Musk’s goofy mode is the flip side of his demon mode,” Isaacson writes. Musk likes this kind of cover. “I reinvented electric cars, and I’m sending people to Mars in a rocket ship,” he said in his “S.N.L.” monologue, in 2021. “Did you think I was also going to be a chill, normal dude?” In that monologue, he also said that he has Asperger’s. A writer in Newsweek applauded this announcement as a “milestone in the history of neurodiversity.” But, in Slate, Sara Luterman, who is autistic, was less impressed; she denounced Musk’s “coming out” as “self-serving and hollow, a poor attempt at laundering his image as a heartless billionaire more concerned with cryptocurrency and rocket ships than the lives of others.” She put cruelty first. Musk’s interest in acquiring Twitter dates to 2022. That year, he and Grimes had another child. His name is Techno Mechanicus Musk, but his parents call him Tau, for the irrational number. But Musk also lost a child. His twins with Justine turned eighteen in 2022 and one of them, who had apparently become a Marxist, told Musk, “I hate you and everything you stand for.” It was, to some degree, in an anguished attempt to heal this developing rift that, in 2020, Musk tweeted, “I am selling almost all physical possessions. Will own no house.” That didn’t work. In 2022, his disaffected child petitioned a California court for a name change, to Vivian Jenna Wilson, citing, as the reason for the petition, “Gender Identity and the fact that I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.” She refuses to see him. Musk told Isaacson he puts some of the blame for this on her progressive Los Angeles high school. Lamenting the “woke-mind virus,” he decided to buy Twitter. I just can’t sit around and do nothing. Musk’s estrangement from his daughter is sad, but of far greater consequence is his seeming estrangement from humanity itself. When Musk decided to buy Twitter, he wrote a letter to its board. “I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,” he explained, but “I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form.” This is flimflam. Twitter never has and never will be a vehicle for democratic expression. It is a privately held corporation that monetizes human expression and algorithmically maximizes its distribution for profit, and what turns out to be most profitable is sowing social, cultural, and political division. Its participants are a very tiny, skewed slice of humanity that has American journalism in a choke hold. Twitter does not operate on the principle of representation, which is the cornerstone of democratic governance. It has no concept of the “civil” in “civil society.” Nor has Elon Musk, at any point in his career, displayed any commitment to either democratic governance or the freedom of expression. Musk gave Isaacson a different explanation for buying the company: “Unless the woke-mind virus, which is fundamentally antiscience, antimerit, and antihuman in general, is stopped, civilization will never become multiplanetary.” It’s as if Musk had come to believe the sorts of mission statements that the man-boy gods of Silicon Valley had long been peddling. “At first, I thought it didn’t fit into my primary large missions,” he told Isaacson, about Twitter. “But I’ve come to believe it can be part of the mission of preserving civilization, buying our society more time to become multiplanetary.” Elon Musk plans to make the world safe for democracy, save civilization from itself, and bring the light of human consciousness to the stars in a ship he will call the Heart of Gold, for a spaceship fuelled by an Improbability Drive in “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.” In case you’ve never read it, what actually happens in “The Hitchhiker’s Guide” is that the Heart of Gold is stolen by Zaphod Beeblebrox, who is the President of the Galaxy, has two heads and three arms, is the inventor of the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, has been named, by “the triple-breasted whore of Eroticon 6,” the “Biggest Bang Since the Big One,” and, according to his private brain-care specialist, Gag Halfrunt, “has personality problems beyond the dreams of analysts.” Person of the Year material, for sure. All the same, as a Vogon Fleet prepares to shoot down the Heart of Gold with Beeblebrox on board, Halfrunt muses that “it will be a pity to lose him,” but, “well, Zaphod’s just this guy, you know?” ♦ First she scandalized Washington. Then she became a princess. The unravelling of an expert on serial killers. What exactly happened between Neanderthals and humans? When you eat a dried fig, you’re probably chewing wasp mummies, too.

FILE - Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk speaks at the SATELLITE Conference and Exhibition, March 9, 2020, in Washington. Musk’s refusal to allow Ukraine to use Starlink internet services to launch a surprise attack on Russian forces in Crimea last September has raised questions for the Pentagon. The Air Force’s top civilian leader, Frank Kendall, says the military may need to be more explicit in future defense contracts that services or products it purchases could be used in war. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. (AP) — SpaceX founder Elon Musk’s refusal to allow Ukraine to use Starlink internet services to launch a surprise attack on Russian forces in Crimea last September has raised questions as to whether the U.S. military needs to be more explicit in future contracts that services or products it purchases could be used in war, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said Monday.  Excerpts of a new biography of Musk published by The Washington Post last week revealed that the Ukrainians in September 2022 had asked for the Starlink support to attack Russian naval vessels based at the Crimean port of Sevastopol. Musk had refused due to concerns that Russia would launch a nuclear attack in response. Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and claims it as its territory. Musk was not on a military contract when he refused the Crimea request; he’d been providing terminals to Ukraine for free in response to Russia’s February 2022 invasion. However, in the months since, the U.S. military has funded and officially contracted with Starlink for continued support. The Pentagon has not disclosed the terms or cost of that contract, citing operational security. But the Pentagon is reliant on SpaceX for far more than the Ukraine response, and the uncertainty that Musk or any other commercial vendor could refuse to provide services in a future conflict has led space systems military planners to reconsider what needs to be explicitly laid out in future agreements, Kendall said during a roundtable with reporters at the Air Force Association convention at National Harbor, Maryland, on Monday. “If we’re going to rely upon commercial architectures or commercial systems for operational use, then we have to have some assurances that they’re going to be available,” Kendall said. “We have to have that. Otherwise they are a convenience and maybe an economy in peacetime, but they’re not something we can rely upon in wartime.”  
SpaceX also has the contract to help the Air Force’s Air Mobility Command develop a rocket ship that would quickly move military cargo into a conflict zone or disaster zone, which could alleviate the military’s reliance on slower aircraft or ships. While not specifying SpaceX, Gen. Mike Minihan, head of Air Mobility Command, said, “American industry has to be clear-eyed on the full spectrum of what it could be used for.” As U.S. military investment in space has increased in recent years, concerns have revolved around how to indemnify commercial vendors from liability in case something goes wrong in a launch and whether the U.S. military has an obligation to defend those firms’ assets, such as their satellites or ground stations, if they are providing military support in a conflict.  Until Musk’s refusal in Ukraine, there had not been a focus on whether there needed to be language saying a firm providing military support in war had to agree that that support could be used in combat. “We acquire technology, we acquire services, required platforms to serve the Air Force mission, or in this case, the Department of the Air Force,” said Andrew Hunter, assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology and logistics. “So that is an expectation, that it is going to be used for Air Force purposes, which will include, when necessary, to be used to support combat operations.” Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Musk wanted to save that money by moving the servers to one of X's other facilities, in Portland, Oregon. Another manager at the meeting said ..."," Related Stories *This is adapted from Walter Isaacson's biography, ""Elon Musk,"" published this month. ""Does this timeframe seem like something that I would find remotely acceptable?"" Musk asked. ""Obviously not. If a timeline is long, it's wrong."" It was late at night on December 22, and the meeting in Musk's 10th floor conference room at X, formerly Twitter, had become tense. He was talking to two X infrastructure managers who had not dealt with him much before, and certainly not when he was in a foul mood. One of them tried to explain the problem. The data-services company that housed one of X's server farms, located in Sacramento, had agreed to allow them some short-term extensions on their lease so they could begin to move out during 2023 in an orderly fashion. ""But this morning,"" the nervous manager told Musk, ""they came back to us and said that plan was no longer on the table because, and these are their words, they don't think that we will be financially viable."" The facility was costing X more than $100 million a year. Musk wanted to save that money by moving the servers to one of X's other facilities, in Portland, Oregon. Another manager at the meeting said that couldn't be done right away. ""We can't get out safely before six to nine months,"" she said in a matter-of-fact tone. ""Sacramento still needs to be around to serve traffic."" Over the years, Musk had been faced many times with a choice between what he thought was necessary and what others told him was possible. The result was almost always the same. He paused in silence for a few moments, then announced, ""You have 90 days to do it. If you can't make that work, your resignation is accepted."" The manager began to explain in detail some of the obstacles to relocating the servers to Portland. ""It has different rack densities, different power densities,"" she said. ""So the rooms need to be upgraded."" She started to give a lot more details, but after a minute, Musk interrupted. ""This is making my brain hurt,"" he said. ""I'm sorry, that was not my intention,"" she replied in a measured monotone. ""Do you know the head-explosion emoji?"" he asked her. ""That's what my head feels like right now. What a pile of f---ing bulls---. Jesus H f---ing Christ. Portland obviously has tons of room. It's trivial to move servers one place to another."" The X managers again tried to explain the constraints. Musk interrupted. ""Can you have someone go to our server centers and send me videos of the insides?"" he asked. It was three days before Christmas, and the manager promised the video in a week. ""No, tomorrow,"" Musk ordered. ""I've built server centers myself, and I can tell if you could put more servers there or not. That's why I asked if you had actually visited these facilities. If you've not been there, you're just talking bulls---."" SpaceX and Tesla were successful because Musk relentlessly pushed his teams to be scrappier, more nimble, and to launch fire-drill surges that extruded all obstacles. That's how they had cobbled together a car production line in a tent in Fremont and a test facility in the Texas desert and a launch site at Cape Canaveral made of used parts. ""All you need to do is just move the f---ing servers to Portland,"" he said. ""If it takes longer than 30 days, that would blow my mind."" He paused and recalculated. ""Just get a moving company, and it will take a week to move the computers and another week to plug them in. Two weeks. That's what should happen."" Everyone was silent. But Musk was still warming up. ""If you got a godd--- U-Haul, you could probably do it by yourself."" The two X managers looked to see if he was serious. Two of Musk's top loyalists, Steve Davis and Omead Afshar were also at the table. They had seen him like this many times before, and they knew that he might be. ""Why don't we do it right now?"" James Musk asked. James and his brother Andrew, younger first cousins of Musk, were flying with him from San Francisco to Austin on Friday evening, December 23, the day after the frustrating infrastructure meeting about how long it would take to move the servers out of the Sacramento facility. Avid skiers, they had planned to go by themselves to Tahoe for Christmas, but Elon that day invited them to come to Austin instead. James was reluctant. He was mentally exhausted and didn't need more intensity, but Andrew convinced him that they should go. So that's how they ended up on the plane listening to Elon complain about the servers. They were somewhere over Las Vegas when James made his suggestion that they could move them now. It was the type of impulsive, impractical, surge-into-the-breach idea that Musk loved. It was already late evening, but he told his pilot to divert, and they made a loop back up to Sacramento. The only rental car they could find when they landed was a Toyota Corolla. They were not sure how they would even get inside the data center at night, but one very surprised X staffer, a guy named Alex from Uzbekistan, was still there. He merrily let them in and showed them around. The facility, which housed rooms of servers for many other companies as well, was very secure, with a retinal scan required for entry into each of the vaults. Alex the Uzbek was able to get them into the X vault, which contained about 5,200 refrigerator-size racks of 30 computers each. ""These things do not look that hard to move,"" Elon announced. It was a reality-distorting assertion, since each rack weighed about 2,500 pounds and was eight feet tall. ""You'll have to hire a contractor to lift the floor panels,"" Alex said. ""They need to be lifted with suction cups."" Another set of contractors, he said, would then have to go underneath the floor panels and disconnect the electric cables and seismic rods. Musk turned to his security guard and asked to borrow his pocket knife. Using it, he was able to lift one of the air vents in the floor, which allowed him to pry open the floor panels. He then crawled under the server floor himself, used the knife to jimmy open an electrical cabinet, pulled the server plugs, and waited to see what happened. Nothing exploded. The server was ready to be moved. ""Well that doesn't seem super hard,"" he said as Alex the Uzbek and the rest of the gang stared. Musk was totally jazzed by this point. It was, he said with a loud laugh, like a remake of Mission: Impossible, Sacramento edition. The next day — Christmas Eve — Musk called in reinforcements. Ross Nordeen, who worked with his friend James at Tesla, drove from San Francisco. He stopped at the Apple Store in Union Square and spent $2,000 to buy out the entire stock of AirTags so the servers could be tracked on their journey, and then stopped at Home Depot, where he spent $2,500 on wrenches, bolt-cutters, headlamps, and the tools needed to unscrew the seismic bolts. Steve Davis, a loyal Musk lieutenant, got someone to procure a semi truck and line up moving vans. Other enlistees arrived from SpaceX. The server racks were on wheels, so the team was able to disconnect four of them and roll them to the waiting truck. This showed that all fifty-two hundred or so could probably be moved within days. ""The guys are kicking ass!"" Musk exulted. Other workers at the facility watched with a mix of amazement and horror. Musk and his renegade team were rolling servers out without putting them in crates or swaddling them in protective material, then using store-bought straps to secure them in the truck. ""I've never loaded a semi before,"" James admitted. Ross called it ""terrifying."" It was like cleaning out a closet, ""but the stuff in it is totally critical."" At 3 p.m., after they had gotten four servers onto the truck, word of the caper reached the top executives at NTT, the company that owned and managed the data center. They issued orders that Musk's team halt. Musk had the mix of glee and anger that often accompanied one of his manic surges. He called the CEO of the storage division, who told him it was impossible to move server racks without a bevy of experts. ""Bulls---,"" Musk explained. ""We have already loaded four onto the semi."" The CEO then told him that some of the floors could not handle more than 500 pounds of pressure, so rolling a 2,000-pound server would cause damage. Musk replied that the servers had four wheels, so the pressure at any one point was only 500 pounds. ""The dude is not very good at math,"" Musk told the musketeers. Having ruined the Christmas Eve of the NTT managers, as well as hitting them with a potential loss of more than $100 million in revenue for the coming year, Musk showed pity and said he would suspend moving the servers for two days. But they would resume, he warned, the day after Christmas. After Christmas, Andrew and James headed back to Sacramento to see how many more servers they could move. They hadn't brought enough clothes, so they went to Walmart and bought jeans and T-shirts. The moving contractors that NTT wanted them to use charged $200 an hour. So James went on Yelp and found a company named Extra Care Movers that would do the work at one-tenth the cost. The motley company pushed the ideal of scrappiness to its outer limits. The owner had lived on the streets for a while, then had a kid, and he was trying to turn his life around. He didn't have a bank account, so James ended up using PayPal to pay him. The second day, the crew wanted cash, so James went to a bank and withdrew $13,000 from his personal account. Two of the crew members had no identification, which made it hard for them to sign into the facility. But they made up for it in hustle. ""You get a dollar tip for every additional server we move,"" James announced at one point. From then on, when they got a new one on a truck, the workers would ask how many they were up to. The servers had user data on them, and James did not initially realize that, for privacy reasons, they were supposed to be wiped clean before being moved. ""By the time we learned this, the servers had already been unplugged and rolled out, so there was no way we would roll them back, plug them in, and then wipe them,"" he says. Plus, the wiping software wasn't working. ""F---, what do we do?"" he asked. Elon recommended that they lock the trucks and track them. So James sent someone to Home Depot to buy big padlocks, and they sent the combination codes on a spreadsheet to Portland so the trucks could be opened there. ""I can't believe it worked,"" James says. ""They all made it to Portland safely."" By the end of the week, they had used all of the available trucks in Sacramento. Despite the area being pummeled by rain, they moved more than 700 of the racks in three days. The previous record at that facility had been moving 30 in a month. That still left a lot of servers in the facility, but the musketeers had proven that they could be moved quickly. The rest were handled by the X infrastructure team in January. All very exciting and inspiring, right? An example of Musk's bold and scrappy approach! But as with all things Musk, it was, alas, not that simple. It was also an example of his recklessness, his impatience with pushback, and the way he intimidated people. X's infrastructure engineers had tried to explain to him, in that head-explosion-emoji meeting a week earlier, why a quick shutdown of the Sacramento center would be a problem, but he shot them down. He had a good track record of knowing when to ignore naysayers. But not a perfect one. For the next two months, X was destabilized. The lack of servers caused meltdowns, including when Musk hosted a Twitter Spaces for presidential candidate Ron DeSantis. ""In retrospect, the whole Sacramento shutdown was a mistake,"" Musk would admit in March 2023. ""I was told we had redundancy across our data centers. What I wasn't told was that we had 70,000 hard-coded references to Sacramento. And there's still shit that's broken because of it."" His most valuable lieutenants at Tesla and SpaceX had learned ways to deflect his bad ideas and drip-feed him unwelcome information, but the legacy employees at X didn't know how to handle him. That said, X survived. And the Sacramento caper showed X employees that he was serious when he spoke about the need for a maniacal sense of urgency.

He’s also aggressively aiding its development. Elon Musk, 52, became interested in how AI might benefit—or destroy—humanity in the early 2010s, and invested millions of dollars into the AI startup DeepMind. But after DeepMind was bought by Google in 2014, Musk became concerned that Google would not take AI safety seriously. So he co-founded a new AI company, OpenAI, with Sam Altman, to try to counter Google’s growing dominance in the field and develop what they considered a more responsible approach to creating artificial general intelligence (AGI), a hypothetical future AI system that can do anything the human brain can.  Musk resigned from OpenAI’s board in 2018, however, and the company has expanded into a juggernaut that critics fear is itself moving too fast. Musk is one of those critics: he has publicly traded barbs with Altman and referred to OpenAI as a “profit-maximizing demon from hell.” He has also criticized OpenAI’s ChatGPT for being “politically correct” and pledged to build his own chatbot called “TruthGPT.” Whether or not that project comes to fruition, Musk has his hands full with an array of AI projects, including his new company xAI, which was announced in July and aims to “understand the true nature of the universe”; self-driving cars at Tesla; Neuralink, which aims to plant microchips into human brains that would enable people to talk to computers directly; and Optimus, a human-like robot designed to navigate the physical world.  But even as Musk races ahead, he loudly voices his concerns about the threats AI could pose to humanity, and played a significant role in bringing those concerns to the mainstream. Musk signed an open letter in March calling for a pause on AI development and training. “AI is more dangerous than, say, mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance or bad car production, in the sense that … it has the potential of civilization destruction,” he told Tucker Carlson this year. Musk’s enormous wealth alone ensures he will remain among the most influential power players in AI. But he also stands out for the tension between his contradictory views on its risks and rewards.

He is convening a meeting of prominent technology executives to ask them how Congress should do it. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)                               WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation’s biggest technology executives on Wednesday loosely endorsed the idea of government regulations for artificial intelligence at an unusual closed-door meeting in the U.S. Senate. But there is little consensus on what regulation would look like, and the political path for legislation is difficult.  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who organized the private forum on Capitol Hill as part of a push to legislate artificial intelligence, said he asked everyone in the room — including almost two dozen tech executives, advocates and skeptics — whether government should have a role in the oversight of artificial intelligence, and “every single person raised their hands, even though they had diverse views,” he said. Among the ideas discussed was whether there should be an independent agency to oversee certain aspects of the rapidly-developing technology, how companies could be more transparent and how the United States can stay ahead of China and other countries. “The key point was really that it’s important for us to have a referee,” said Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and X, during a break in the daylong forum. “It was a very civilized discussion, actually, among some of the smartest people in the world.”  Schumer will not necessarily take the tech executives’ advice as he works with colleagues on the politically difficult task of ensuring some oversight of the burgeoning sector. But he invited them to the meeting in hopes that they would give senators some realistic direction for meaningful regulation.   
Congress should do what it can to maximize AI’s benefits and minimize the negatives, Schumer said, “whether that’s enshrining bias, or the loss of jobs, or even the kind of doomsday scenarios that were mentioned in the room. And only government can be there to put in guardrails.”  Other executives attending the meeting were Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Musk said the meeting “might go down in history as being very important for the future of civilization.”  First, though, lawmakers have to agree on whether to regulate, and how.  Congress has a lackluster track record when it comes to regulating new technology, and the industry has grown mostly unchecked by government in the past several decades. Many lawmakers point to the failure to pass any legislation surrounding social media, such as for stricter privacy standards. Schumer, who has made AI one of his top issues as leader, said regulation of artificial intelligence will be “one of the most difficult issues we can ever take on,” and he listed some of the reasons why: It’s technically complicated, it keeps changing and it “has such a wide, broad effect across the whole world,” he said. Sparked by the release of ChatGPT less than a year ago, businesses have been clamoring to apply new generative AI tools that can compose human-like passages of text, program computer code and create novel images, audio and video. The hype over such tools has accelerated worries over its potential societal harms and prompted calls for more transparency in how the data behind the new products is collected and used. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who led the meeting with Schumer, said Congress needs to get ahead of fast-moving AI by making sure it continues to develop “on the positive side” while also taking care of potential issues surrounding data transparency and privacy. “AI is not going away, and it can do some really good things or it can be a real challenge,” Rounds said. The tech leaders and others outlined their views at the meeting, with each participant getting three minutes to speak on a topic of their choosing. Schumer and Rounds then led a group discussion.  During the discussion, according to attendees who spoke about it, Musk and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt raised existential risks posed by AI, and Zuckerberg brought up the question of closed vs. “open source” AI models. Gates talked about feeding the hungry. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna expressed opposition to proposals favored by other companies that would require licenses.  In terms of a potential new agency for regulation, “that is one of the biggest questions we have to answer and that we will continue to discuss,” Schumer said. Musk said afterward he thinks the creation of a regulatory agency is likely.  Outside the meeting, Google CEO Pichai declined to give details about specifics but generally endorsed the idea of Washington involvement.  “I think it’s important that government plays a role, both on the innovation side and building the right safeguards, and I thought it was a productive discussion,” he said.  Some senators were critical that the public was shut out of the meeting, arguing that the tech executives should testify in public.  Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he would not attend what he said was a “giant cocktail party for big tech.” Hawley has introduced legislation with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., to require tech companies to seek licenses for high-risk AI systems.  “I don’t know why we would invite all the biggest monopolists in the world to come and give Congress tips on how to help them make more money and then close it to the public,” Hawley said.  While civil rights and labor groups were also represented at the meeting, some experts worried that Schumer’s event risked emphasizing the concerns of big firms over everyone else. Sarah Myers West, managing director of the nonprofit AI Now Institute, estimated that the combined net worth of the room Wednesday was $550 billion and it was “hard to envision a room like that in any way meaningfully representing the interests of the broader public.” She did not attend.  In the United States, major tech companies have expressed support for AI regulations, though they don’t necessarily agree on what that means. Similarly, members of Congress agree that legislation is needed, but there is little consensus on what to do.  There is also division, with some members of Congress worrying more about overregulation of the industry while others are concerned more about the potential risks. Those differences often fall along party lines.  “I am involved in this process in large measure to ensure that we act, but we don’t act more boldly or over-broadly than the circumstances require,” Young said. “We should be skeptical of government, which is why I think it’s important that you got Republicans at the table.” Some concrete proposals have already been introduced, including legislation by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., that would require disclaimers for AI-generated election ads with deceptive imagery and sounds. Schumer said they discussed “the need to do something fairly immediate” before next year’s presidential election. Hawley and Blumenthal’s broader approach would create a government oversight authority with the power to audit certain AI systems for harms before granting a license. Some of those invited to Capitol Hill, such as Musk, have voiced dire concerns evoking popular science fiction about the possibility of humanity losing control to advanced AI systems if the right safeguards are not in place. But the only academic invited to the forum, Deborah Raji, a University of California, Berkeley researcher who has studied algorithmic bias, said she tried to emphasize real-world harms already occurring. “There was a lot of care to make sure the room was a balanced conversation, or as balanced as it could be” Raji said. What remains to be seen, she said, is which voices senators will listen to and what priorities they elevate as they work to pass new laws. Some Republicans have been wary of following the path of the European Union, which signed off in June on the world’s first set of comprehensive rules for artificial intelligence. The EU’s AI Act will govern any product or service that uses an AI system and classify them according to four levels of risk, from minimal to unacceptable. A group of European corporations has called on EU leaders to rethink the rules, arguing that it could make it harder for companies in the 27-nation bloc to compete with rivals overseas in the use of generative AI.

https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66850821,"Elon Musk: Social media platform X, formerly Twitter, could go ...",20230901,"Sep 19, 2023 ... The billionaire suggested the social media platform, now called X, could charge for use of ""the system"".","Elon Musk has suggested that all users of X, formerly called Twitter, may have to pay for access to the platform. In a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the billionaire said a payment system was the only way to counter bots. ""We're moving to having a small monthly payment for use of the system,"" the Tesla and SpaceX boss said. The BBC approached X for further details but has not yet received a statement from the company. It is unclear whether this was just an off-the-cuff comment, or a signal of firmer plans that have yet to be announced. Mr Musk has long said that his solution for getting rid of bots and fake accounts on the social media platform is charging for verification. Since taking over Twitter last year he has looked to incentivise users to pay for an enhanced service, which is now called X Premium. This has been done by giving paid subscribers more features, like longer posts and increased visibility on the platform.  However, users can currently still use X for free. Although there is a clear financial interest for the company to charge users, Mr Musk insisted that getting people to pay for the service is aimed at tackling bots. ""A bot costs a fraction of a penny"" to make he said. ""But if somebody even has to pay a few dollars or something, some minor amount, the effective cost to bots is very high"". X Premium currently costs $8 (£6.50) a month in the US. The price differs depending on which country a subscriber is in. The world's richest person said that he was now looking at cheaper options for users. ""We're actually going to come up with a lower tier pricing. So we just want it to be just a small amount of money,"" he said. ""This is a longer discussion, but in my view, this is actually the only defence against vast armies of bots,"" Mr Musk added. However, a risk is that by putting X behind a paywall it may lose a large chunk of its users. That in turn, could drive down advertising revenue, which currently accounts for the vast majority of the company's income. Mr Musk's conversation with the Israeli prime minister also touched on antisemitism on X. The platform has been accused by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) campaign group of not doing enough to stop antisemitic content. In a statement, the organisation said that Mr Musk was ""engaging with and elevating"" antisemites. Earlier this month, he said that the company would sue the ADL to ""clear our platform's name"". In the conversation with Mr Netanyahu, Mr Musk reiterated that he was ""against antisemitism"". Mr Netanyahu accepted the balance between free speech and content moderation was a challenge but urged Mr Musk to get the balance right. ""I hope you find within the confines of the First Amendment, the ability to stop not only antisemitism... but any collective hatred of people that antisemitism represents,"" he said. ""I know you're committed to that"", Mr Netanyahu added. This video can not be played Watch: Musk takes son to meet Turkish President Erdogan Musk takes son to meet Turkey's President Erdogan.

We have a country where our political system is corrupt, because of Citizens United and billionaires buying elections. We have massive ...","A NEW PRESIDENTIAL election cycle is heating up, and Bernie Sanders finds himself in an unfamiliar position: on the sidelines.  The independent senator from Vermont, who rallied millions of progressive supporters behind his bids in 2016 and 2020, is not making a run for the White House in 2024. Instead, he is now talking up his former rival Joe Biden — as well as the dire threat to democracy posed by another Trump term.  Sanders sings Biden’s praises as president, insisting he has plenty to be “proud” of from his first term. But no one would mistake Sanders as a supporter of the status quo. The Democratic socialist has strong ideas about what the incumbent can do — or, as Sanders puts it, “must do” — to transform what now polls like a tossup with Trump into a blowout victory. Sanders is emphatic that Biden must level with the American people about the seriousness of the crises we face, and call out the true obstacles to change: an extremist GOP; unchecked billionaire power; and “corporate democrats” like Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, whom he blames for blocking legislation that would have “have transformed life for working-class families in this country.” Rolling Stone spoke to Sanders not only about the sky-high stakes of the 2024 contest, but also his support for the Hollywood writers’ strike, his pipe dream of a 32-hour work week, and even Elon Musk’s meteoric greed.  This following transcript has been edited for length and clarity. Lay out the stakes for the 2024 election, and why you’re backing Biden — rather than challenging him — for the nomination. This is a momentous election. The American people are going to make profound choices about whether they want to bring back into power somebody like a Trump — who has been impeached twice, indicted four times, is a pathological liar, and who has worked to undermine American democracy and move us toward authoritarianism. Do we want somebody like that to be president of the United States?  But what concerns me is that, if you look at the polling right now, you are seeing a more-or-less even situation, Trump versus Biden. If you were to counsel somebody who has lost faith in the two-party political process — a voter who is considering backing a third-party candidate like Cornel West, for example — what would you say to them to get them on board for Biden ‘24. I am the longest serving independent in the history of the United States of America. So I know something about this issue. I’m not going to argue with Cornel, who is a good friend of mine, about his analysis of what’s going on in America. We have a country where our political system is corrupt, because of Citizens United and billionaires buying elections. We have massive concentration of ownership in this country, a health care system that is broken, et cetera.  On the other hand: We are facing the real possibility that the United States will lose its democratic foundations if Trump once again becomes the president. And that risk is so great that people are going to have to say, “Look, we have to defeat Trump and support Biden.”  But at the same time they can make it clear to Biden that he is going to have to stand up for working-class people in a much stronger way. It’s not good enough for him to rest on his laurels. He’s going to have to take on corporate greed, and we need young people — working-class people — and activists to play a role in that. How do Biden and Democrats make the case? Here is what the Democrats have got to do — and should do, and must do — in order to win this election, and win it big.  First, what the Democrats are doing now, which is right and important, is making clear that women should be able to control their own bodies, not state government. The vast majority of Americans agree with them. And they have got to stay with that issue. Big time.  Second, we’ve got to make it very, very clear that we are taking on a [Republican] party which increasingly does not believe in democracy, but believes in authoritarianism and right-wing extremism. And third is to point out that, in Biden’s first three years, there have been massive accomplishments. Three years ago, this country was in desperate condition because of Covid and the economic downturn. The American Rescue Plan got this country back on its feet. We’ve also dealt with infrastructure in an unprecedented way — more investment in clean energy than ever before. We’re beginning to take on the pharmaceutical industry and lower the cost of prescription drugs, [expand] overtime pay, et cetera. There’s a lot that Democrats and the American people are right to be very proud of.  But you think he needs to promise more for 2024? All of that is important. But it is not enough. The White House has got to say: We have a lot more to do. Sixty percent of working people are living paycheck to paycheck, too many seniors have nothing in the bank for retirement, we have an affordable housing crisis, a child care crisis, an education crisis. And Biden needs to be honest with the American people about how we’re going to address these structural crises facing the working class of this country. [He needs to say]: “Give me 50 real Democrats — not Manchin or Sinema — 50 real Democrats in the Senate. Give me majority control in the House.” What’s challenging here is that in the pandemic-era, we saw a proving ground for remarkable progressive policies like expanded Medicaid enrollment, direct cash to families, the pause in student loan repayments. And all that is all dissipating — and not under Republican president. Some progressives are disillusioned. Here’s how to address it. And this is where it requires people — and the media —  to be dealing with reality. [We had a plan to] deal with the structural crises faced by America. That was Build Back Better. I was chairman of the Budget Committee at the time. We started off with a $6 trillion bill, which would have transformed life for working-class families in this country. We had zero support from Republicans, not one. And we lost two corporate Democrats. We had 48 votes; we couldn’t proceed.  So all of those enormous achievements, as you mentioned, during the Covid era, they’re disappearing right and left. We’re seeing millions of people losing their Medicaid, and the reason for that is we don’t have the kind of support we need in the Senate and Republicans are controlling the House. That is the point that has got to be made clear to the American people. You brought up Trump’s legal troubles. What is your confidence in the ability of our legal system to bring him to justice? Is a former president too big to jail? No. Everybody in America is subject to the law. My own personal view is that Trump tried to undermine American democracy and undermine the election results. That goes to the heart of what democracy is supposed to be about. When you lose, you accept it, accept the will of the people. He did not.  But what concerns me is he’s still getting a lot of support. It is no secret that in recent years Democrats have lost a lot of support from white working-class people, from Latino workers. They’re losing support, right now, even from Black workers. We’ve got to win that support back. And we can.  There is no reason why working-class people should be voting for a political party where most of the congressional representatives want to cut Social Security, want to cut Medicare, want to cut Medicaid, are “right to work” supporters, and don’t even believe in the reality of climate change.  Biden has to thread a needle in 2024 — not losing the Cornel West voter but also not losing the Joe Manchin voter. Manchin may be flirting with a third-party run himself. How does Biden keep the center-right in the Big Tent while also promising a more progressive agenda? You do that by fighting for ideas that are popular. I saw a poll a number of months ago that was just Republicans. Do you know what their major issue was? It was not overthrowing the United States government. It was the high cost of prescription drugs. If Biden says, “We’ve made progress — the Inflation Reduction Act begins Medicare drug-price negotiations — but we got to go further,” he’ll win enormous amount of support — from conservative Democrats, from progressives, from Republicans. Or you say to seniors in this country — many of whom are Republicans — we know you can’t afford dental care, you can’t afford your hearing aid, you can’t afford your eyeglasses. We’re going to expand Medicare to cover dental, vision, hearing. That’s enormously popular, I’ve seen polls where 80 percent of the American people support it. You don’t have to be radical. Do what the American people want.  The other thing people understand, whether they’re Republican, Democrat, or independent, is corporate greed is at an outrageous level. This is not just Bernie Sanders talking. It doesn’t take a genius to understand that one of the reasons we had high inflation is not just the war in Ukraine, not just the breakdown in supply chain, it was greed.  Inflation, of course, gave political cover for rolling back Covid-era social support. Folks claimed that extra money in consumer pockets was driving up prices. You don’t buy that? That’s certainly the Republican line. And some of the Democrats are frightened about that line. But the American people are catching on that we are looking really at an unprecedented level of corporate greed. If you’re paying, as I am in Vermont, $3.89 for a gallon of gas today, that’s a lot to do with ExxonMobil making $55 billion in profits last year. Or look at the record breaking profits in the major food corporations. Paying more for rent? Check out what Wall Street is doing in housing. Check out the prescription drug industry; the pharmaceutical industry doing phenomenally well. Look at all these profits, enormously high stock buybacks, dividends. The president has got to make it clear — and most Americans will support this — that we’re going to take on corporate greed. They cannot have it all.  The poster billionaire for unaccountable power right now is Elon Musk. But he’s also benefited enormously from government contracts and subsidies. Are there federal carrots or sticks that could help bring someone like that back into an accountable mode? Excellent question. And it is Musk — but it’s not just Musk. You got Bezos. You got others. I’ll give you one example, and that is the degree to which NASA is being privatized. You had an effort providing billions of dollars to Bezos. Musk has benefited from contracts. And you’re looking at people like Musk and Bezos playing a very significant role in outer space development.  It’s no secret Musk wants to develop Mars. And by the way, the kind of riches that he could benefit from mining — literally mining — meteors is a huge amount of money. Do you know that? No one is talking about it. Right now, Musk and Bezos literally have the legal right to take rare minerals off a meteor for their own personal gain — which to me is literally beyond comprehension. We’re just a few days past Labor Day. What are your thoughts on the Hollywood strike against the massive studios? The American people are behind the writers and actors. We all understand what artificial intelligence and new technologies are going to mean to the workforce. And actors and writers are running into that right now. Entertainment is extremely important for this country, for all of us. And the American people are supportive of the strike, and want the industry to come to terms in a fair way with their employees. You’ve called for an “unprecedented worker response to the unprecedented corporate greed” and even floated the idea of a 32-hour work week, with the same pay. How do you see that working? Technology unto itself, is neither good nor bad. It’s how it is used, and who benefits. If you have new technology that can help physicians detect disease, that is a very good thing. If you have technology that can do work that today is dangerous and monotonous for workers, that is a good thing. But if you have technology that simply increases productivity and throws workers out on the street, that is a bad thing.  The bottom line is we have to make sure that artificial intelligence, robotics, and other technologies benefit working people. If we are increasing worker productivity — and we are, that is what technology does — I want workers to benefit from that. What does that mean? The 40-hour work was created in 1940. That is 83 years ago, the world has changed! We can reduce the work week, from 40 hours down to 32 hours with no loss of pay. So they have more time for leisure, family time, education, cultural activities. People are stressed out right now. And work has a lot to do with that stress.  We’re seeing age as a real issue in politics. A couple of your colleagues, Mitch McConnell and Dianne Feinstein, are having major issues. And Donald Trump and Joe Biden would both be well into their 80s by the end of the next presidential term. How should voters assess the issue?  I’m 42, I wouldn’t know about that. [Laughs.]  Listen, age is a factor. But it is one of many factors. If you think somebody is old and can’t perform, don’t vote for that person. That’s fine. But at the end of the day, when you look at a political figure, what is most important is what they stand for.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will fly to California on Monday to meet Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur accused by civil rights ...","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, chairs the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem, Sunday, Sep 10, 2023.     Ohad Zwigenberg/Pool via REUTERS  Acquire Licensing Rights Sept 14 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will fly to California on Monday to meet Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur accused by civil rights groups of amplifying anti-Jewish hatred on his X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter. An official in Netanyahu's office on Thursday confirmed the meeting. Musk said on X that their talks would focus on artificial intelligence technology and not the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), with whom Musk is feuding over antisemitism on X. The prime minister's office said Netanyahu, a champion of Israel's high tech sector, would meet Musk and others on developing artificial intelligence. The Washington Post, which broke the news of the Musk-Netanyahu meeting, cited five people familiar with the situation as saying the meeting was the latest step in a campaign by Musk’s Jewish friends and allies to stave off the mounting criticism surrounding the increase in antisemitic speech on X. Netanyahu is also due to meet President Joe Biden in New York next week, according to a U.S. official. Netanyahu's office said the two leaders will meet during the prime minister's trip to the UN General Assembly, where the pair are both due to speak, but did not specify the exact location of the meeting. Biden has expressed concern about a judicial overhaul undertaken by Netanyahu and his right-wing government as well as Israel's expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Hate speech on X has increased dramatically since Musk bought the site last year and loosened safeguards around content moderation. Last week, Musk said U.S. ad revenue had declined by 60%. Civil rights groups, including the Center for Countering Digital Hate and the ADL, have issued findings that the volume of hate speech on X has grown dramatically under the stewardship of Musk, who is also CEO of electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA.O). On Thursday, an ADL spokesperson issued a statement saying: ""Nothing about this meeting is particularly surprising given that Israel’s technology sector is one of the most innovative and dynamic in the world. However, Israel and Jews are frequently targets of hateful anti-Zionist, and antisemitic invectives on Twitter/X and we hope they will have a productive meeting and talk about ways to combat antisemitism and anti-Zionist hate speech on the platform."" News of the meeting drew criticism from UnXeptable, a movement launched by Israeli citizens disturbed by their home country’s rightward turn. The group announced it would organize protests in San Jose and San Francisco on Monday. “It’s deeply unacceptable that Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the world’s only Jewish state, who calls himself the protector of Israel, is flying across America to seek the counsel and support from a notorious enabler of anti-Jewish hate speech,” Offir Gutelzon, a tech entrepreneur and co-founder of UnXeptable, said. In December, the ADL noted both an increase in antisemitic content on the platform and a decrease in the moderation of antisemitic posts since Musk took over. The Center for Countering Digital Hate said the daily use of a racial slur against Black people under Musk was triple the 2022 average and slurs against gay men and trans persons were up 58% and 62%, respectively. Without providing evidence, Musk has blamed critics for the slump in ad revenue. He has pointed the finger specifically at pressure from the ADL, which he has started to pejoratively refer to as the ""Defamation League,"" including in his statement on X on Thursday. Earlier this month, Musk joined a conversation on X with a hashtag #BantheADL, embraced by white nationalists and antisemites, and asked followers whether he should poll the platform about it. He engaged in exchanges with users who expressed antisemitic viewpoints during the discussion. X's new content moderation policy has made it challenging to convince brands that the social media platform was safe for ads, the company's former head of brand safety and ad quality AJ Brown told Reuters in an interview this month. Foreign investment in Israeli tech startups has plunged in the last year, partly due to a global slowdown and exacerbated by investor fears that the push to trim the Supreme Court's powers would remove a key check and balance. With foreign flows down sharply, the shekel has weakened by nearly 9% versus the dollar this year. Netanyahu is due to meet other world leaders at the U.N., including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

                  Jared Isaacman, founder and CEO of Shift4 who commanded the Inspiration4 mission, announced today the Polaris Program, a first-of-its-kind effort to rapidly advance human spaceflight capabilities, while continuing to raise funds and awareness for important causes here on Earth. The program will consist of up to three human spaceflight missions that will demonstrate new technologies, conduct extensive research, and ultimately culminate in the first flight of SpaceX’s Starship with humans on board.
                   
                  The first mission, Polaris Dawn, is targeted to launch no earlier than the fourth quarter of 2022 from historic Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This Dragon mission will take advantage of Falcon 9 and Dragon’s maximum performance, flying higher than any Dragon mission to date and endeavoring to reach the highest Earth orbit ever flown. Dragon and the Polaris Dawn crew will spend up to five days in orbit, during which the crew will attempt the first-ever commercial spacewalk, conduct scientific research designed to advance both human health on Earth and our understanding of human health during future long-duration spaceflights, and be the first crew to test Starlink laser-based communications in space, providing valuable data for future space communications systems necessary for missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.
                   
                  The Polaris Dawn mission has many first-time objectives, so the Polaris Program chose a crew of experts who know each other well and have a foundation of trust they can build upon as they undergo the challenges of this mission. In addition to Isaacman, the crew includes Scott “Kidd” Poteet, a veteran member of Jared’s team, and two SpaceX employees, Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon.
                   
                  On Thursday, February 10 from Starbase in Texas, SpaceX Chief Engineer Elon Musk provided an update on the development of Starship, a fully reusable transportation system capable of carrying passengers and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond.
                   
                  On Thursday, February 3 at 1:13 p.m. EST, Falcon 9 launched 49 Starlink satellites to low Earth orbit from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Falcon 9’s second stage deployed the satellites into their intended orbit, with a perigee of approximately 210 kilometers above Earth, and each satellite achieved controlled flight.
                   
                  SpaceX deploys its satellites into these lower orbits so that in the very rare case any satellite does not pass initial system checkouts it will quickly be deorbited by atmospheric drag. While the low deployment altitude requires more capable satellites at a considerable cost to us, it’s the right thing to do to maintain a sustainable space environment.
                   
                  Unfortunately, the satellites deployed on Thursday were significantly impacted by a geomagnetic storm on Friday. These storms cause the atmosphere to warm and atmospheric density at our low deployment altitudes to increase. In fact, onboard GPS suggests the escalation speed and severity of the storm caused atmospheric drag to increase up to 50 percent higher than during previous launches. The Starlink team commanded the satellites into a safe-mode where they would fly edge-on (like a sheet of paper) to minimize drag—to effectively “take cover from the storm”—and continued to work closely with the Space Force’s 18th Space Control Squadron and LeoLabs to provide updates on the satellites based on ground radars.
                   
                  Preliminary analysis show the increased drag at the low altitudes prevented the satellites from leaving safe-mode to begin orbit raising maneuvers, and up to 40 of the satellites will reenter or already have reentered the Earth’s atmosphere. The deorbiting satellites pose zero collision risk with other satellites and by design demise upon atmospheric reentry—meaning no orbital debris is created and no satellite parts hit the ground. This unique situation demonstrates the great lengths the Starlink team has gone to ensure the system is on the leading edge of on-orbit debris mitigation.
                   On Tuesday, November 23 at 10:21 p.m. PST, Falcon 9 launched NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission to an interplanetary transfer orbit from Space Launch Complex 4 East (SLC-4E) at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. DART is humanity’s first planetary defense test mission to see if intentionally crashing a spacecraft into an asteroid is an effective way to change its course, should an Earth-threatening asteroid be discovered in the future. This was SpaceX’s first inter-planetary mission. This was the third flight for this Falcon 9’s first stage booster, which previously supported launch of Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich and a Starlink mission. On Thursday, November 11 at 6:32 p.m. EST, 23:32 UTC, SpaceX’s Dragon autonomously docked with the International Space Station. Falcon 9 launched the spacecraft to orbit from histsoric Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday, November 10 at 9:03 p.m. EST. On Thursday, November 11 at 6:32 p.m. EST, 23:32 UTC, SpaceX’s Dragon autonomously docked with the International Space Station. Falcon 9 launched the spacecraft to orbit from histsoric Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday, November 10 at 9:03 p.m. EST. After 199 days in space, the longest-duration mission for a U.S. spacecraft, Dragon and the Crew-2 astronauts, Shane Kimbrough , Megan McArthur , Akihiko Hoshide , and Thomas Pesquet , returned to Earth, splashing down off the coast of Pensacola, Florida at 10:33 p.m. EST on November 8. Dragon and the Crew-2 astronauts were quickly recovered by the SpaceX recovery team. SpaceX will transport Dragon back to Cape Canaveral, Florida for inspections and refurbishment ahead of future human spaceflight missions. This mission marked multiple firsts for SpaceX and NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, including being the first to fly two international partners, the first crew mission to use a flight-proven Dragon and Falcon 9, and the first U.S. spacecraft to spend 199 consecutive days in orbit. After three days orbiting Earth, Dragon and the Inspiration4 crew – the world’s first civilian mission to orbit – safely splashed down off the coast of Florida at 7:06 p.m. EDT on Saturday, September 18, 2021, completing their first multi-day low Earth orbit mission. Dragon performed a series of departure phasing burns to leave the circular orbit of 575 kilometers and then jettisoned its trunk ahead of its deorbit burn. After re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere, the spacecraft deployed its two drogue and four main parachutes in preparation for the soft water landing.  Inspiration4 is commanded by Jared Isaacman, founder and CEO of Shift4 Payments and an accomplished pilot and adventurer. Joining him are Medical Officer Hayley Arceneaux, a physician assistant at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital® and pediatric cancer survivor; Mission Specialist Chris Sembroski, an Air Force veteran and aerospace data engineer; and Mission Pilot Dr. Sian Proctor, a geoscientist, entrepreneur, and trained pilot. Developed by SpaceX to support NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, Dragon helped return human spaceflight capabilities in 2020 and has successfully flown three human spaceflight missions to the International Space Station (ISS) to-date. In addition to flying astronauts to space for NASA, Dragon can also carry commercial astronauts to Earth orbit, the ISS or beyond. Today, Axiom Space announced SpaceX will fly three additional private crew missions aboard Dragon to and from the Station through 2023. Axiom previously announced their first mission to the International Space Station flying aboard Dragon, currently targeted to liftoff no earlier than January 2022. In May 2021, Axiom announced that astronaut Peggy Whitson and champion GT racer John Shoffner will serve as commander and pilot on the Ax-2 mission . All four crews will receive combined commercial astronaut training from NASA and SpaceX, with SpaceX providing training on the Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft, emergency preparedness training, spacesuit and spacecraft ingress and egress exercises, as well as partial and full simulations. The growing partnership between Axiom and SpaceX will enable more opportunities for more humans in space on the road to making humanity multiplanetary. On Wednesday, May 5, Starship serial number 15 (SN15) successfully completed SpaceX’s fifth high-altitude flight test of a Starship prototype from Starbase in Texas. Similar to previous high-altitude flight tests of Starship , SN15 was powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee – approximately 10 km in altitude. SN15 performed a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent. The Starship prototype descended under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps were actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship’s attitude during flight and enabled precise landing at the intended location. SN15’s Raptor engines reignited as the vehicle performed the landing flip maneuver immediately before touching down for a nominal landing on the pad. These test flights of Starship are all about improving our understanding and development of a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration interplanetary flights, and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond. Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on SN15’s successful flight and landing! After 167 days in space, the longest duration mission for a U.S. spacecraft since the final Skylab mission in 1974, Dragon and the Crew-1 astronauts, Mike Hopkins , Victor Glover , Shannon Walker , and Soichi Noguchi , returned to Earth on Sunday, May 2, 2021. Dragon autonomously undocked from the International Space Station at 8:35 p.m. EDT on Saturday, May 1. The spacecraft performed a series of departure burns to move away from the orbiting laboratory. Before reentry, Dragon jettisoned its trunk to reduce weight and mass to help save propellant for the deorbit burn. The spacecraft then re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere and deployed its two drogue and four main parachutes in preparation for the soft water landing. Approximately 6.5 hours after undocking, Dragon splashed down off the coast of Florida at 2:56 a.m. EDT on Sunday, May 2, completing the spacecraft’s first long-duration operational mission. This was also the first nighttime splashdown of a U.S. spacecraft with crew on board since Apollo 8’s return in 1968. Upon splashdown, Dragon and the Crew-1 astronauts were quickly recovered by the SpaceX recovery team. SpaceX will transport Dragon back to Cape Canaveral for inspections and refurbishment ahead of future human spaceflight missions. On Saturday, April 24 at 5:08 a.m. EDT, 9:08 UTC, SpaceX’s Dragon autonomously docked with the International Space Station (ISS) after Falcon 9 launched the spacecraft to orbit from historic Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday, April 23 at 5:49 a.m. EDT, 9:49 UTC. This is the first human spaceflight mission to fly astronauts on a flight-proven Falcon 9 and Dragon. The Falcon 9 first stage supporting this mission previously launched the Crew-1 mission in November 2020, and the Dragon spacecraft previously flew Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley to and from the International Space Station during SpaceX’s Demo-2 mission in 2020. As part of the Commercial Crew Program, NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur , Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Akihiko Hoshide , and European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Thomas Pesquet flew aboard the Dragon spacecraft on its second operational mission to the space station. This was the first time Dragon flew two international partners and also the first time two Crew Dragons are attached simultaneously to the orbiting laboratory. After an approximate six-month stay, Dragon and the Crew-2 astronauts will depart from the space station no earlier than October 31 for return to Earth and splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida. Only 24 humans have been to the Moon, and no one has been back since 1972. Today, NASA announced they have selected Starship to land the first astronauts on the lunar surface since the Apollo program. We are humbled to help NASA usher in a new era of human space exploration. Together, NASA and SpaceX have successfully executed similarly bold and innovative partnerships, including restoring America’s ability to launch astronauts to orbit and return them safely home. We will build upon our shared accomplishments, and leverage years of close technical collaboration to return to the Moon. In doing so, we will lay the groundwork for human exploration to Mars and beyond. Sustaining a human presence on the Moon will require the safe and affordable transportation of crew and significant amounts of cargo. SpaceX’s Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket represent an integrated and fully reusable launch, propellant delivery, rendezvous, and planetary lander system with robust capabilities and safety features uniquely designed to deliver these essential building blocks. Flying between lunar orbit and the surface of the Moon, Starship will carry crew and all of the supplies, equipment, and science payloads needed for extensive surface exploration. Building off the safety and reliability of Dragon and Falcon, Starship will feature proven avionics, guidance and navigation systems, autonomous rendezvous, docking and precision landing capabilities, as well as thermal protection, and a spacious cabin with familiar displays and interfaces utilized on Dragon . SpaceX is rapidly advancing Starship development, drawing on an extensive history of launch vehicle and engine development programs. Since January 2020, SpaceX has built 10 Starship prototypes, with production and fidelity accelerating on each build. SpaceX has manufactured and tested more than 60 of Starship’s Raptor engines, accumulating nearly 30,000 seconds of total test time over 567 engine starts, including on multiple Starship static fires and flight tests. We have conducted six suborbital flight tests, including two 150-m hops and four high-altitude flights. SpaceX has also built a full-size Super Heavy booster as part of a pathfinder effort, and currently has five vehicles in production. We are honored to be a part of NASA’s Artemis Program to safely land the first woman and next man on the surface of the Moon, as the first of many, many more people to follow. On Tuesday, March 30, SpaceX launched its fourth high-altitude flight test of Starship from Starbase in Texas. Similar to previous high-altitude flight tests, Starship Serial Number 11 (SN11) was powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee – approximately 10 km in altitude. SN11 performed a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent. Shortly after the landing burn started, SN11 experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly. Teams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test. Test flights are all about improving our understanding and development of a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration interplanetary flights, and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond. On Wednesday, March 3, Starship serial number (SN10) successfully completed SpaceX’s third high-altitude flight test of a Starship prototype from our site in Cameron County, Texas. Similar to the high-altitude flight tests of Starship SN8 and SN9 , SN10 was powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee – approximately 10 km in altitude. SN10 performed a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent. The Starship prototype descended under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps were actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship’s attitude during flight and enabled a precise landing at the intended location. SN10’s Raptor engines reignited as the vehicle performed the landing flip maneuver immediately before successfully touching down on the landing pad! As if the flight test was not exciting enough, SN10 experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly shortly after landing. All in all a great day for the Starship teams – these test flights are all about improving our understanding and development of a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration interplanetary flights, and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond. Congratulations to the entire Starship and SpaceX teams on the flight test! In 2018, Japanese entrepreneur, Yusaku Maezawa, announced the world’s first private passenger mission to fly by the Moon aboard Starship . Known as dearMoon, this mission is an important step toward enabling access for people who dream of traveling to space. Today, the dearMoon project opened the application process for eight civilians to join Yusaku Maezawa on the week-long Starship mission around the Moon in 2023. Visit the dearMoon website or watch the video above to learn more on how to apply and potentially become a dearMoon crew member! On Tuesday, February 2, Starship serial number 9 (SN9) completed SpaceX’s second high-altitude flight test of a Starship prototype from our site in Cameron County, Texas. Similar to the high-altitude flight test of Starship serial number 8 (SN8) , SN9 was powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee – approximately 10 kilometers in altitude. SN9 successfully performed a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent. The Starship prototype descended under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps are actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship’s attitude during flight and enable precise landing at the intended location. During the landing flip maneuver, one of the Raptor engines did not relight and caused SN9 to land at high speed and experience a RUD. These test flights are all about improving our understanding and development of a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration, interplanetary flights and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond. In 2020, SpaceX returned America’s ability to fly NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station for the first time since the Space Shuttle’s last flight in 2011. In addition to flying astronauts for NASA, Dragon was also designed to carry commercial astronauts to Earth orbit, the space station, or beyond. Today, it was announced SpaceX is targeting no earlier than the fourth quarter of this year for Falcon 9’s launch of Inspiration4 – the world’s first all-commercial astronaut mission to orbit – from historic Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Jared Isaacman, founder and CEO of Shift4 Payments, is donating the three seats alongside him aboard Dragon to individuals from the general public who will be announced in the weeks ahead. Learn more on how to potentially join this historic journey to space by visiting Inspiration4.com . The Inspiration4 crew will receive commercial astronaut training by SpaceX on the Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft, orbital mechanics, operating in microgravity, zero gravity, and other forms of stress testing. They will go through emergency preparedness training, spacesuit and spacecraft ingress and egress exercises, as well as partial and full mission simulations. This multi-day journey, orbiting Earth every 90 minutes along a customized flight path, will be carefully monitored at every step by SpaceX mission control. Upon conclusion of the mission, Dragon will reenter Earth’s atmosphere for a soft water landing off the coast of Florida. On Wednesday, December 9, Starship serial number 8 (SN8) lifted off from our Cameron County launch pad and successfully ascended, transitioned propellant, and performed its landing flip maneuver with precise flap control to reach its landing point. Low pressure in the fuel header tank during the landing burn led to high touchdown velocity resulting in a hard (and exciting!) landing. Re-watch SN8's flight here.  Thank you to all the locals supporting our efforts in Cameron County and beyond. Congratulations to the entire Starship and SpaceX teams on today’s test! Serial number 9 (SN9) is up next – Mars, here we come! On Monday, November 16 at 11:01 p.m. EST, 04:01 UTC on November 17, SpaceX’s Dragon autonomously docked with the International Space Station (ISS) after Falcon 9 launched the spacecraft to orbit from historic Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sunday, November 15, 2020. As part of the Commercial Crew Program, NASA astronauts Mike Hopkins , Victor Glover , Shannon Walker , and JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi flew aboard Dragon on its first six-month operational mission to the space station. After its approximately six-month stay at the orbiting laboratory, Dragon and the astronauts will return to Earth and splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida. Following Dragon’s second demonstration mission (Demo-2), NASA certified SpaceX for operational crew missions to and from the space station. Crew-1 is the first of three scheduled Dragon human spaceflights over the course of 2020 and 2021. The return of human spaceflight to the United States with one of the safest, most advanced systems ever built is a turning point for America’s future space exploration, and it lays the groundwork for missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Today, NASA announced it has certified SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon human spaceflight system for crew missions to and from the International Space Station – the first commercial system in history to achieve such designation. Not since the certification of the space shuttle nearly 40 years ago has NASA certified a spacecraft, rocket, and ground support systems for regular flights with astronauts. Launched atop Falcon 9 on May 30, 2020, Dragon 's second demonstration flight test to and from the space station restored human spaceflight to the United States for the first time in almost a decade. That flight was the culmination of years of development, testing, and training—all throughout safety remained SpaceX’s top priority. SpaceX put every component of every system through its paces, including two flight tests to and from the International Space Station, demonstrations of Dragon’s escape system both on the launch pad and in-flight, over 700 tests of the spacecraft's SuperDraco engines, more than 500 joint soft-capture docking tests to validate the performance of Dragon’s docking system design, about 8,000,000 hours of hardware in the loop software testing, and nearly 100 tests and flights of Dragon’s parachutes to ensure a safe landing back on Earth—in addition to all of the knowledge gained from twenty previous successful cargo resupply missions to the space station and over forty Falcon 9 block 5 launches. SpaceX and NASA are targeting Saturday, November 14 at 7:49 p.m. EST for the launch of the first crew rotation mission (Crew-1) to the International Space Station as part of the agency’s Commercial Crew Program. The Crew-1 mission will launch NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins , Victor Glover , and Shannon Walker , along with Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) mission specialist Soichi Noguchi , from historic Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Human spaceflight is SpaceX’s core mission, and we take seriously the responsibility that NASA has entrusted in us to safely carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. We are humbled to help NASA usher in a new era of space exploration. On Saturday, October 24 at 11:31 a.m. EDT, 11:31 UTC, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket launched 60 Starlink satellites to orbit from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Falcon 9’s first stage previously supported the GPS III Space Vehicle 03 mission in June 2020 and a Starlink mission in September 2020. Following stage separation, SpaceX landed Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Just Read the Instructions” droneship, which was stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. The Starlink satellites deployed approximately 1 hour and 3 minutes after liftoff. If you would like to receive updates on Starlink news and service availability in your area, please visit starlink.com . This mission also marked the 100th successful flight of a Falcon rocket since Falcon 1 first flew to orbit in 2008. SpaceX believes that fully and rapidly reusable rockets are the pivotal breakthrough needed to dramatically reduce the cost of access to space to enable people to travel to and live on other planets. While most rockets are expendable after launch — akin to throwing away an airplane after a one-way trip from Los Angeles to New York — SpaceX is working toward a future in which reusable rockets are the norm. Of its now 100 successful flights of Falcon rockets, SpaceX has landed a Falcon first stage rocket booster 63 times and re-flown boosters 45 times. This year, SpaceX twice accomplished the sixth flight of an orbital rocket booster. And, in the ten years since its demonstration mission, Falcon 9 has become the most-flown operational rocket in the United States, overtaking expendable rockets that have been launching for decades. The difficulty of precision landing an orbital rocket after it reenters Earth’s atmosphere at hypersonic velocity is not to be overlooked — SpaceX remains the only launch provider in the world capable of accomplishing this task. At 14 stories tall and traveling upwards of 1300 m/s (nearly 1 mi/s), stabilizing Falcon 9’s first stage booster for landing is like trying to balance a rubber broomstick on your hand in the middle of a hurricane. While recovery and re-flight of an orbital rocket booster may now seem routine, developing Falcon such that it would withstand reentry and return for landing was generally accepted as impossible — and SpaceX learned many lessons on the road to reusability . SpaceX’s accomplishments with flight-proven rockets and spacecraft have allowed us to further advance the fleet’s reliability and reusability, as well as inform the development of Starship — SpaceX’s next-generation fully and rapidly reusable super heavy lift transportation system. Starship’s capability of full and rapid reuse will lower the cost of spaceflight to help humanity return to the Moon, travel to Mars, and ultimately become multi-planetary. Ahead of Falcon 9’s upcoming launch of GPS III-4, the United States Space Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) announced today an agreement with SpaceX to recover the first stage booster and, for the first time on a National Security Space Launch (NSSL) mission, launch previously flown boosters on future GPS missions. SpaceX is proud to leverage its flight-proven capabilities toward national security space launch missions. SpaceX was also recently selected by the Space Force to carry out critical National Security Space Launch (NSSL) missions ordered over the next five years. SpaceX will build upon our years-long collaboration with the United States Air Force and the National Reconnaissance Office to utilize the operationally mature Falcon fleet, which has achieved NSSL certification and completed a combined 95 orbital missions to date for a variety of customers. With Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy , SpaceX is capable of performing every type of national security space mission, to every required reference orbit, with significant performance and schedule margin. To meet or exceed the demanding and unique requirements of the NSSL program, SpaceX invested over a billion dollars of its own money into the Falcon fleet and the associated ground infrastructure, manufacturing processes, payload integration procedures, and mission assurance processes. This private investment over multiple years reflects SpaceX’s deep commitment to reliably launching our customers' payloads to orbit. And, as SpaceX brought competition back to national security space launch, the United States Air Force saved billions in critical taxpayer funds. SpaceX is honored to support the United States Space Force with a solution given the highest possible rating for system capability, schedule readiness, and system risk, using a mix of new and flight-proven launch vehicles. We look forward to leveraging this extensive capability to continue delivering the country’s most reliable and affordable launch services for years to come. On Tuesday, August 4 at 4:56 p.m. CDT in Boca Chica, Texas, Starship serial number 5 (SN5) lifted-off from its launch mount and flew to a height of 150 meters before successfully touching down on a near-by landing pad. On this flight test, SN5 was powered by a single Raptor engine – a reusable methalox full-flow staged-combustion rocket engine. This test flight was an important step in development of SpaceX’s fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and beyond. On Saturday, May 30, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 launched Crew Dragon’s second demonstration (Demo-2) mission from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley aboard the spacecraft. Dragon autonomously docked to the International Space Station on Sunday, May 31, 2020. Sixty-three days later, Crew Dragon undocked and departed from the orbiting laboratory, before successfully splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Pensacola, Florida on Sunday, August 2 at 2:48 p.m. EDT. This test flight marked the return of human spaceflight to the United States and the first-time in history a commercial company successfully took astronauts to orbit and back. The Demo-2 mission was also the final major test milestone for SpaceX’s human spaceflight system to be certified by NASA for operational crew missions to and from the International Space Station. With the Demo-2 mission now complete, SpaceX and NASA teams are reviewing all the data for certification before NASA astronauts Victor Glover, Mike Hopkins, Shannon Walker, and JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi fly on Dragon’s first six-month operational mission (Crew-1), targeted for late September. On Saturday, May 30 at 3:22 p.m. EDT, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 launched Crew Dragon’s second demonstration (Demo-2) mission from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and the next day Crew Dragon autonomously docked to the International Space Station. This test flight with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley on board the Dragon spacecraft returned human spaceflight to the United States. Demo-2 is the final major test for SpaceX’s human spaceflight system to be certified by NASA for operational crew missions to and from the International Space Station. SpaceX is returning human spaceflight to the United States with one of the safest, most advanced systems ever built, and NASA’s Commercial Crew Program is a turning point for America’s future in space exploration that lays the groundwork for future missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. SpaceX is launching Starlink to provide high-speed, low-latency broadband connectivity across the globe, including to locations where internet has traditionally been too expensive, unreliable, or entirely unavailable. We also firmly believe in the importance of a natural night sky for all of us to enjoy, which is why we have been working with leading astronomers around the world to better understand the specifics of their observations and engineering changes we can make to reduce satellite brightness. Our goals include: Making the satellites generally invisible to the naked eye within a week of launch. We're doing this by changing the way the satellites fly to their operational altitude, so that they fly with the satellite knife-edge to the Sun. We are working on implementing this as soon as possible for all satellites since it is a software change. Minimizing Starlink's impact on astronomy by darkening satellites so they do not saturate observatory detectors. We're accomplishing this by adding a deployable visor to the satellite to block sunlight from hitting the brightest parts of the spacecraft. The first unit is flying on the next launch, and by flight 9 in June all future Starlink satellites will have sun visors. Additionally, information about our satellites' orbits are located on space-track.org to facilitate observation scheduling for astronomers. We are interested in feedback on ways to improve the utility and timeliness of this information. To better explain the details of brightness mitigation efforts, we need to explain more about how the Starlink satellites work. Starlink Orbits Starlink has three phases of flight: (1) orbit raise, (2) parking orbit (380 km above Earth), and (3) on-station (550 km above Earth). During orbit raise the satellites use their thrusters to raise altitude over the course of a few weeks. Some of the satellites go directly to station while others pause in the parking orbit to allow the satellites to precess to a different orbital plane. Once satellites are on-station they reconfigure so the antennas face Earth and the solar array goes vertical so that it can track the Sun to maximize power generation. As a result of this maneuver, the satellites become much darker because the solar array visibility from the ground is greatly reduced. Currently, about half of the over 400 satellites are on-station and the other half are orbit raising or in the parking orbit. Satellites spend a small fraction of their lives orbit raising or parking and spend the vast majority of their lives on-station. It's important to note that at any given time, only about several hundred satellites will be orbit raising or parking. The rest of the satellites will be in the operational orbit on-station. Starlink Satellite The Starlink satellite design was driven by the fact that they fly at a very low altitude compared to other communications satellites. We do this to prioritize space traffic safety and to minimize the latency of the signal between the satellite and the users who are getting internet service from it. Because of the low altitude, drag is a major factor in the design. During orbit raise, the satellites must minimize their cross-sectional area relative to the 'wind,' otherwise drag will cause them to fall out of orbit. High drag is a double-edged sword—it means that flying the satellites is tricky, but it also means that any satellites that are experiencing problems will de-orbit quickly and safely burn up in the atmosphere. This reduces the amount of orbital debris or 'space junk' in orbit. This low-drag and thrusting flight configuration resembles an open book, where the solar array is laid out flat in front of the vehicle. When Starlink satellites are orbit raising, they roll to a limited extent about the velocity vector for power generation, always keeping the cross sectional area minimized while keeping the antennas facing Earth enough to stay in contact with the ground stations. When the satellites reach their operational orbit of 550 km, drag is still a factor—so any inoperable satellite will quickly decay—but the attitude control system is able to overcome this drag with the solar array raised above the satellite in a vertical orientation that we call 'shark-fin.' This is the orientation in which the satellite spends the majority of its operational life. Satellite Visibility Satellites are visible from the ground at sunrise or sunset. This happens because the satellites are illuminated by the Sun but people or telescopes on the ground are in the dark. These conditions only happen for a fraction of Starlink's 90-minute orbit. This simple diagram highlights why satellites in orbit raise are so much brighter than the satellites that are on-station. During orbit raise, when the solar array is in open book, sunlight can reflect off of both the solar array and the body of the satellite and hit the ground. Once on-station, only certain parts of the chassis can reflect light to the ground. Physics of Satellite Brightness The apparent magnitude of an object is a measure of the brightness of a star or object observed from Earth. It is a reverse logarithmic scale, so higher numbers correspond to dimmer objects. A star of magnitude 3 is approximately 2.5 times brighter than a star of magnitude 4. Based on observations that have been taken by us and by members of the astronomical community, current Starlink satellites have an average apparent magnitude of 5.5 when on-station and brighter during orbit raise. Objects up to about magnitude 6.5-7 are visible to the naked eye (naked-eye visibility is closer to 4 in most suburbs), and our goal is for Starlink satellites to be magnitude 7 or better for almost all phases of their mission. There are two types of reflections off of Starlink satellites: diffuse and specular. Diffuse reflections occur when light is scattered in many different directions. Imagine shining a flashlight at a white wall. Specular reflections happen when light is reflected in a particular direction. For example, the glint of sunlight off of a mirror. Diffuse reflections are the biggest contributor to observed brightness on the ground, because diffuse reflections go in all directions. You can see diffuse reflections as long as the satellite is visible. This is why Starlink satellites can create the 'string of pearls' effect in the night sky. It's a little counter-intuitive, but the shiny components of the Starlink satellites are a much smaller problem. Whether diffuse or specular, having a high reflectance helps the satellites stay cool in space. When sunlight hits a specular surface of the spacecraft and reflects, the vast majority of light reflects in the specular (mirror reflection) direction, which is generally out toward space (not toward Earth). Occasionally when it does, the glint only lasts for a second or less. In fact, specular surfaces tend to be the dimmest part of the satellite unless you are at just the right geometry. The biggest contributors to Starlink being bright are the white diffuse phased array antennas on the bottom of the satellite, the white diffuse parabolic antennas on the sides (not shown below), and the white diffuse back side of the solar array. These surfaces are all white to keep temperatures down so components do not overheat. The key to making Starlink darker is to prevent sunlight from illuminating these white surfaces and scattering via reflection toward observers on the ground. While in orbit raise and the parking orbit the solar array dominates due to the much larger surface area. However, once the satellites are at their operational altitude, the antennas dominate because the bright backside of the solar array is shadowed. Solutions In-Work We've taken an experimental and iterative approach to reducing the brightness of the Starlink satellites. Orbital brightness is an extremely difficult problem to tackle analytically, so we've been hard at work on both ground and on-orbit testing. For example, earlier this year we launched DarkSat, which is an experimental satellite where we darkened the phased array and parabolic antennas designed to tackle on-station brightness. This reduced the brightness of the satellite by about 55%, as was verified by differential optical measurements comparing DarkSat to other nearby Starlink satellites. This is nearly enough of a brightness reduction to make the satellite invisible to the naked eye while on-station. However, black surfaces in space get hot and reflect some light (including in the IR spectrum), so we are moving forward with a sun visor solution instead. This avoids thermal issues due to black paint, and is expected to be darker than DarkSat since it will block all light from reaching the white diffuse antennas. Early Mission (Orbit Raise and Parking Orbit) Roll Maneuver Since the visor is intended to help with brightness while on-station, it does not shade the back of the solar array, which means that it will not prevent orbit raise and parking orbit brightness. For this, we are working on changing the way the satellite flies up from insertion to parking orbit and to station. We're currently testing rolling the satellite so the vector of the Sun is in-plane with the satellite body, i.e. so the satellite is knife-edge to the Sun. This would reduce the light reflected onto Earth by reducing the surface area that receives light. This is possible when orbit raising and parking in the precession orbit because we don't have to constrain the antennas to be nadir facing to provide coverage to internet users. However, there are a couple of nuanced reasons why this is tricky to implement. First, rolling the solar array away from the Sun reduces the amount of power available to the satellite. Second, because the antennas will sometimes be rolled away from the ground, contact time with the satellites will be reduced. Third, the star tracker cameras are located on the sides of the chassis (the only place they can go and have adequate field of view). Rolling knife edge to the Sun can point one star tracker directly at the Earth and the other one directly at the Sun, which would cause the satellite to have degraded attitude knowledge. There will be a small percentage of instances when the satellites cannot roll all the way to true knife edge to the Sun due to one of the aforementioned constraints. This could result in the occasional set of Starlink satellites in the orbit raise of flight that are temporarily visible for one part of an orbit. On-Station Brightness Satellites spend most of their lives on-station, where they will always be in the shark-fin configuration during visible passes. We can adjust the solar array positioning in this configuration to reflect light from its largely specular solar cells away from Earth and to partially hide it behind the chassis. The main remaining goal is to block the phased arrays and antennae from direct view of the sun. The goal is to cover the white phased array antennas and the parabolic antennas on the sides of the satellite. Using our low orbital altitude and flat satellite geometry to our advantage, we designed an RF-transparent deployable visor for the satellite that blocks the light from reaching most of the satellite body and all of the diffuse parts of the main body. This visor lays flat on the chassis during launch and deploys during satellite separation from Falcon 9. The visor prevents light from reflecting off of the diffuse antennas by blocking the light from reaching the antennas altogether. Not only does this approach avoid the thermal impacts from surface darkening the antennas, but it should also have a larger impact on brightness reduction. As previously noted, the first VisorSat prototype will launch in May and we will have these black, specular visors on all satellites by June. The parabolic antennas on the sides of the Starlink satellite also have visor-like coverings that darken them. We have been working with leading astronomical groups in this effort—in particular the American Astronomical Society and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory—to better understand the methods and instruments employed by the astronomy community. With AAS, we have increased our understanding of the community as a whole through regular calls with a working group of astronomers during which we discuss technical details, provide updates, and work on how we can protect astronomical observations moving forward. A post on some of our sessions is here . One particularly useful presentation from a member of this working group is here . While community understanding is critical to this problem, engineering problems are difficult to solve without specifics. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory was repeatedly flagged as the most difficult case to solve, so we've spent the last few months working very closely with a technical team there to do just that. Among other useful thoughts and discussions, the Vera Rubin team has provided a target brightness reduction that we are using to guide our engineering efforts as we iterate on brightness solutions. These technical and community discussions are paired with our existing efforts to make the satellites easier for astronomers to avoid. Starlink trajectories are published through space-track.org and celestrak.com , which many astronomers use in timing their observations to avoid satellite streaks. We've also started publishing predictive data prior to launch at the request of astronomers. These allow observatories to schedule around the satellites in the first few hours of deployment (as satellites de-tumble and enter the network). Vera Rubin has been described as the limiting case for Starlink, due to its enormous aperture and wide field of view. These two characteristics work in concert to produce the perfect storm for satellite observations. Most astronomical systems look at an extremely small section of the sky (less than 1 degree), which makes it exceedingly unlikely that a satellite will cross in front of the imaging system in a given observation. On the other hand, systems with very large fields of view normally aren't extremely sensitive, meaning that, while streaks will occur, they will have a small impact on the overall data collection. This is why we've been working so closely with the team at the Rubin Observatory. In fact, despite its wide field of view, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is sensitive enough to detect a sunlit golf ball as far away as the Moon. So what can we do to mitigate our impact on these edge cases of wide, fast survey telescopes? Minimizing the Impact on Astronomy The huge collecting area of a larger telescopes like Vera C. Rubin Observatory leads to a sensitivity that will render even the darkest satellites visible.They are so sensitive that it won't be possible to build a satellite that will not produce streaks, in a typical long integration. There is much that can be done to reduce the impact of satellite streaks, and that starts with an understanding of how astronomical sensors work. The astronomical community has done a great job of educating us on their imaging techniques. Optical systems use mirrors or lenses to focus light onto an imaging sensor. Most optical astronomy instruments use sensors called charge-coupled-devices (CCDs) as their detectors because astronomical targets, such as distant supernovae and galaxies, are generally dim–at the limit of what can be detected by a sensor. For these applications, the lower noise level of CCDs allows for a higher signal-to-noise ratio for a given image, making it easier to see very faint features in the universe. However, CCDs suffer from a key drawback: when compared to other common sensors, like the CMOS sensor in your cell phone. If you point your cell phone at a bright light, you'll see all the pixels saturate and turn white in the region of the bright source. If you look at the same target with an optical system that uses a CCD sensor, you'll notice that this bright spot extends to create vertical stripes on the image. This difference is due to the way each sensor type reads the values for each pixel. While a CMOS sensor essentially has an amplifier at each pixel that turns the light collected into a digital value, a CCD sensor has a limited number of amplifiers and moves the collected light (in the form of electrons) across the sensor, to be digitized. This mechanism means that a saturated pixel on a CCD tends to wipe out data from an entire column of pixels. This effect, commonly referred to as 'blooming,' is one example of how a very small but bright source of light can impact an astronomical observation. This principle is the core of our mitigation efforts. While it will not be possible to create satellites that are invisible to the most advanced optical equipment on Earth, by reducing the brightness of the satellites, we can make the existing strategies for dealing with similar issues, such as frame-stacking, dramatically more effective. Future Satellites SpaceX is committed to making future satellite designs as dark as possible. The next generation satellite, designed to take advantage of Starship's unique launch capabilities, will be specifically designed to minimize brightness while also increasing the number of consumers that it can serve with high-speed internet access. While SpaceX is the first large constellation manufacturer and operator to address satellite brightness, we won't be the last. As launch costs continue to drop, more constellations will emerge and they too will need to ensure that the optical properties of their satellites don't create problems for observers on the ground. This is why we are working to make this problem easier for everyone to solve in the future. SpaceX and NASA are targeting May 27 for Falcon 9’s launch of Crew Dragon’s second demonstration mission (Demo-2) from historic Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program . NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will be the first two NASA astronauts to fly onboard the Dragon spacecraft as part of the Demo-2 mission to and from the International Space Station, which will return human spaceflight to the United States since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011. Filled with approximately 4,500 pounds of supplies and payloads, Dragon launched aboard a Falcon 9 rocket on March 6, 2020 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The Dragon spacecraft that supported the CRS-20 mission previously supported the CRS-10 mission in February 2017 and the CRS-16 mission in December 2018. Dragon is the only spacecraft currently flying that's capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. The Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Crew Dragon spacecraft that will support Demo-2 are onsite at SpaceX’s facilities in Florida. To mark the return of human spaceflight on American rockets from American soil, NASA has revived their worm logo for Demo-2 . In preparation for Demo-2, SpaceX has completed a number of major milestones for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. In March 2019, SpaceX completed an end-to-end test flight of Crew Dragon without NASA astronauts onboard, making Dragon the first American spacecraft to autonomously dock with the International Space Station and safely return to Earth. In January 2020, SpaceX demonstrated Crew Dragon's in-flight launch escape capability to reliably carry crew to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency on the launch pad or at any point during ascent. SpaceX has completed over 700 tests of the spacecraft's SuperDraco engines, which fired together at full throttle can power Dragon 0.5 miles away from Falcon 9 in 7.5 seconds, accelerating the vehicle more than 400 mph. SpaceX has completed 27 tests of Crew Dragon’s enhanced Mark 3 parachute design, which will provide a safe landing back on Earth for astronauts returning from the Space Station. These tests include 13 successful single parachute drop tests, 12 successful multi-parachute tests, and a successful demonstration of the upgraded parachute system during Crew Dragon’s in-flight abort test . Additionally, SpaceX and NASA have jointly executed a series of mission simulations from launch and docking to departure and landing, an end-to-end demonstration of pad rescue operations , and a fully integrated test of critical crew flight hardware on the Demo-2 Crew Dragon spacecraft with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley participating in their Demo-2 spacesuits. Demo-2 is the final major test for SpaceX’s human spaceflight system to be certified by NASA for operational crew missions to and from the International Space Station. Once Demo-2 is complete, and the SpaceX and NASA teams have reviewed all the data for certification, NASA astronauts Victor Glover , Mike Hopkins , Shannon Walker and JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi have been assigned to fly on Dragon’s first six-month operational mission (Crew-1) targeted for later this year. SpaceX is returning human spaceflight to the United States with one of the safest, most advanced systems ever built, and NASA’s Commercial Crew Program is a turning point for America’s future in space exploration that lays the groundwork for future missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. On Sunday, January 19, SpaceX successfully completed an in-flight test of Crew Dragon’s launch escape capabilities from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This test, which did not have NASA astronauts onboard the spacecraft, demonstrated Crew Dragon’s ability to reliably carry crew to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency on ascent. Falcon 9 and Dragon lifted off at 10:30 a.m. EST, or 15:30 UTC, with the abort sequence initiating approximately one and a half minutes into flight. Crew Dragon's eight SuperDraco engines powered the spacecraft away from Falcon 9 at speeds of over 400 mph. Following separation, Dragon's trunk was released and the spacecraft's parachutes were deployed, first the two drogue parachutes followed by the four upgraded Mark III parachutes. Dragon safely splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean and teams successfully recovered the spacecraft onto SpaceX's recovery vessel. You can watch a replay of launch above and learn more about the mission here . SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy launch vehicle is a fully, rapidly reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and anywhere else in the solar system. On Saturday, September 28 at our launch facility in Cameron County, Texas, SpaceX Chief Engineer Elon Musk provided an update on the design and development of Starship.

Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg.  The trouble began days before the biography was even published. CNN had a story summarizing an excerpt of Walter Isaacson’s Elon Musk that claimed Musk had shut down SpaceX’s satellite network, Starlink, to prevent a “Ukrainian sneak attack” on the Russian navy. The Washington Post followed it up, publishing the excerpt where Isaacson claimed Musk had essentially shut down a military offensive on a personal whim. This reporting did not pass the smell test to me, and I said so at the time; I wondered about the sourcing. One of the things that anyone covering Elon Musk for long enough has to reckon with is that he loves to tell hilarious lies. For instance: The thing you learn after a while on the Musk beat is that his most self-aggrandizing statements usually bear the least resemblance to reality. Musk says a lot of stuff! Some of it is exaggeration, and some isn’t true at all.  Isaacson’s sweeping 670-page biography has an intense amount of access to the man at its center. The problem is the man is Elon Musk, a guy who in 2011 promised to get us to space in just three years. In reality, the first SpaceX crew launched into orbit almost a decade later. Sure, access is the appeal of the biography — but access gives Musk lots of chances to sell his own mythology. I wanted to know if Isaacson had done his homework So when I opened the Musk biography, I wanted to know if Isaacson had done his homework. The first thing I did was flip to the back, where the author lists his sources for the Ukraine thing. They are: interviews with Musk, Gwynne Shotwell, and Jared Birchall (Musk’s body man); emails from Lauren Dreyer; and text messages from Mykhailo Fedorov, “provided by Elon Musk.” Other sources are news articles, one of which was about SpaceX curbing Ukraine’s use of drones. Crucially, though, this article says nothing about Ukrainian submarines — instead, it’s primarily about aerial vehicles.  In his book, Isaacson writes: Throughout the evening and into the night, he [Musk] personally took charge of the situation. Allowing the use of Starlink for the attack, he concluded, could be a disaster for the world. So he secretly told his engineers to turn off coverage within a hundred kilometers of the Crimean coast. As a result, when the Ukrainian drone subs got near the Russian fleet in Sevastopol, they lost connectivity and washed ashore harmlessly. That final sentence is arresting, isn’t it? I could find no support for it in any of the news articles that Isaacson listed as sources for this chapter. There is a Financial Times story that confirms some Starlink outages during a Ukrainian push against the Russians, but it says nothing about drone subs or washing ashore harmlessly. A New York Times article confirms Musk doesn’t want Starlink running drones but says nothing about drone subs. What could the possible source for this sentence be? In the following paragraph, Isaacson quotes text messages from Fedorov, who had “secretly shared with him [Musk] the details of how the drone subs were crucial” to the Ukrainians. Not very secret now, I suppose. Musk disputed Isaacson’s account on Twitter: “SpaceX did not deactivate anything,” he said. “There was an emergency request from government authorities to activate Starlink all the way to Sevastopol,” he went on, though he did not specify which government’s authorities. “If I had agreed to their request, then SpaceX would be explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation.” Isaacson caved immediately: To clarify on the Starlink issue: the Ukrainians THOUGHT coverage was enabled all the way to Crimea, but it was not. They asked Musk to enable it for their drone sub attack on the Russian fleet. Musk did not enable it, because he thought, probably correctly, that would cause a major war. Tremendous statement. “To clarify” obfuscates what’s going on: is Isaacson saying his book is wrong? Surely that is what this means since “future editions will be updated” to correct it. The Post corrected its excerpt, anyway. “The Ukrainians thought” — which Ukrainians, and how did Isaacson know their thinking? In his listed sources, we have only the text messages of one Ukrainian, who, for diplomatic purposes, may be obscuring what he knows. “They asked Musk to enable it for their drone attack” is an entirely different account than the one given in the book, which says Musk shut off existing coverage rather than approving extended coverage; what could possibly be the source here? And of course, the last sentence — “Musk did not enable it because he thought, probably correctly, that would cause a major war” — is simple boot-licking. We are dealing with not one but two unreliable narrators: Musk and Isaacson himself Isaacson “clarified” further in another tweet. ”Based on my conversations with Musk, I mistakenly thought the policy to not allow Starlink to be used for an attack on Crimea had been first decided on the night of the Ukrainian attempted sneak attack that night,” he wrote on Twitter. “He now says that the policy had been implemented earlier, but the Ukrainians did not know it, and that night he simply reaffirmed the policy.” There was a way to find out what’s true here, and it would have been to interview more sources, both Ukrainian and US military ones. Isaacson chose not to. Musk’s word was good enough for him — and so, when Musk contested the characterization, Isaacson rolled over. I am lingering here because it highlights a major problem with Isaacson’s biography. We are dealing with not one but two unreliable narrators: Musk and Isaacson himself. After all, just before issuing his clarification, Isaacson had been touting a walk through the SpaceX factory with CBS’s David Pogue to promote his book.  Isaacson writes a specific kind of biography. There is even a “genius” boxed set of his biographies that includes Benjamin Franklin, Leonardo da Vinci, Albert Einstein, and — somewhat incongruously — Steve Jobs.  One way to keep Musk’s myth intact is simply not to check things out Having made a pattern of writing biographies of important men — and one important woman, Jennifer Doudna of CRISPR fame — Isaacson is now in the position of a kind of kingmaker. To keep up his pattern, everyone he writes about implicitly is branded a genius.  One way to keep Musk’s myth intact is simply not to check things out. Within the first three paragraphs of the book, Isaacson describes a wilderness survival camp Musk attended, where “every few years, one of the kids would die.” This is a striking claim! I flipped to the “notes” section to see if Isaacson had interviewed any of Musk’s schoolmates. He hadn’t. There are no news articles backing it up, either. So what is the source? Presumably one or more of the Musks — Elon is quoted directly as saying the counselors told him not to die like another kid in a previous year.  Arguably the entire Musk family has an interest in presenting Elon Musk as preternaturally tough and also as using his tough childhood as an excuse for his continuing bad behavior. There are some weird choices as a result. Isaacson writes that Musk’s “blood boiled if anyone falsely implied he had succeeded because of inherited wealth or claimed he didn’t deserve to be called a founder of one of the companies he helped start.” The bolding on “falsely” is mine because Isaacson had earlier detailed Errol Musk, Elon’s father, giving Elon and Kimbal Musk “$28,000 plus a beat-up car he bought for $500” to help them start Zip2. Maye, Elon’s mother, contributed another $10,000 and “let them use her credit card because they had not been approved for one.” Certainly Musk got started with family money. Is the problem about the meaning of “inherited wealth”? Skipping how dependent Musk is on Texas is a howler Here’s another strange choice. “Over the years, one criticism of Tesla has been that the company was ‘bailed out’ or ‘subsidized’ by the government in 2009.” This is not quite right. Over the years, the criticism has been that Tesla has gotten a great deal of assistance from state, federal, and local governments, sometimes screwing them in the process, as demonstrated by the Buffalo Gigafactory. By one estimate, Tesla alone has gotten more than $3 billion in loans and subsidies from state and local governments. While Isaacson gives a detailed accounting of Tesla’s $465 million in loans from a DOE program, he skips all the rest of the assists Musk has gotten over the years — goodies that have inspired jealousy from the likes of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. Then there’s this description of Neuralink, Musk’s brain implant company: “The idea for Neuralink was inspired by science fiction, most notably the Culture space-travel novels by Iain Banks.” Maybe so, but there’s actual science fact: brain-machine interfaces had been implanted in humans as early as 2006, something Isaacson doesn’t mention. Musk certainly didn’t come up with the idea; brain-machine interfaces already existed. Nor does Isaacson mention the gruesome allegations about Neuralink’s test subjects. But I want to get to the real big one: Musk’s politics. This is a recurring theme for Isaacson, and his perspective is bewildering. Musk’s dependence on taxpayer largess plays a role here; skipping how dependent Musk is on Texas is a howler. Musk has often donated in ways that will benefit him in Texas, where he has a substantial operation. So writing a sentence like “Musk has never been very political” when Musk has donated more than $1 million to politicians in the last 20 years is odd. Now, I personally view Musk as a political nihilist, willing to say whatever he needs to say to get taxpayer money. But it’s undeniable that he’s spent decades palling around with libertarian-to-far-right types (most famously Peter Thiel and David Sacks, who is inexplicably described as “not rigidly partisan” despite coauthoring a noxious book with Thiel that, among other things, suggested date rape wasn’t real).  If you know these details, Musk looks like a dolt These long-standing right-wing ties belie the notion advanced by Isaacson that the real cause of Musk’s right-wing pivot is his daughter, Jenna; I found these sections of the book difficult to read, as they essentially amount to victim blaming. In Isaacson’s telling, “Jenna’s anger made Musk sensitive to the backlash against billionaires.” She stopped speaking to her father in 2020 and transitioned without telling him.  I wonder, though Isaacson doesn’t, if she didn’t tell him because she was afraid to. Musk found out from a member of his security detail — and it’s revealing to me that none of the people around Musk who knew, including Grimes, wanted to break the news. It’s not unusual for queer people to hide from parents they suspect will reject them; there is a reason many gay and trans people have “found families.”  When Musk tweets, “Take the red pill,” in 2020, Isaacson notes that it’s a reference to The Matrix but does not add that The Matrix is a movie made by two people who later came out as trans. In fact, The Matrix itself is a trans story — in the ’90s, prescription estrogen was literally a red pill. Isaacson includes Ivanka Trump’s reply (“Taken!”) but not that of Matrix creator Lilly Wachowski: “Fuck both of you.” If you know these details, Musk looks like a dolt — sort of a problem for a biographer trying to write a Great Man book. Similarly, Isaacson falls flat on racial issues — the existence of apartheid in Musk’s youth is barely mentioned. It’s a strange omission; Musk’s maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman. was the chair of the national council of the Social Credit Party, which was openly antisemitic. Haldeman’s beliefs are characterized by Isaacson as “quirky conservative populist views,” which… led him to immigrate to Pretoria, South Africa, which was ruled by the racist apartheid regime.  Justine Musk and Amber Heard are both disparaged One of the other things Isaacson doesn’t mention is the alleged racist working conditions at Tesla’s Fremont factory. Recently, a former Tesla worker was awarded millions for racist abuse at work. This does seem relevant to Musk’s politics. Also relevant: how Isaacson treats Musk’s exes. Justine Musk and Amber Heard are both disparaged. Of Justine Musk, Elon’s mother said, “She has no redeeming feature.” Kimbal Musk, Elon’s brother and sometimes business partner, is quoted as saying, “This is the wrong person for you.” We don’t hear Justine’s side of the story, except via a magazine article she published during her divorce, “I Was a Starter Wife.” It makes me wonder: is Justine under a non-disclosure agreement? Did she sign something with a non-disparagement clause, like Tesla founder Martin Eberhard? Isaacson spoke to her — so why did she have nothing to say? Similarly, Amber Heard is described by Kimbal as “so toxic,” by Grimes as “chaotic evil,” and by Musk’s chief of staff as “the Joker in Batman… She thrives on destabilizing everything.” Heard is even blamed for Musk’s misbehavior — including “funding secured” in 2018. Even so, Heard’s response is muted enough (“I love him very much,” she says. “Elon loves fire and sometimes it burns him.”) that I wonder if she, too, is NDA’d. By not even bringing up this possibility, Isaacson’s story is inherently skewed. There is one person we do know is under an NDA: a flight attendant who says Musk propositioned her in 2016. We also know that five women at SpaceX have said that harassment was regular at the company and that women workers at Tesla say they have been subjected to “nightmarish” sexual harassment. This does not especially interest Isaacson. Isaacson does have time for a lot of Steve Jobs comparisons, which, after a while, begin to feel like product placement The workers at Musk’s companies, generally, don’t interest his biographer much. Isaacson begins describing the 2018 Fremont production push from Musk’s perspective: “Musk had come to realize that designing a good factory was like designing a good microchip.” During the production surge, Musk began walking the floor, barking questions at workers, and “making decisions on the fly.” He decided that safety sensors were “too sensitive, tripping when there was no real problem.”  In this chapter, Isaacson cites stories where rank-and-file workers complained about being pressured to take shortcuts and work 10-hour days. “There was some truth to the complaints,” Isaacson writes. “Tesla’s injury rate was 30 percent higher than the rest of the industry.” Leave aside the risible “some truth.” There is a very obvious question that Isaacson had the access to explore: how did Musk’s meddling with the safety sensors, the seat-of-the-pants fixes changes to the manufacturing process, and general “production hell” affect that injury rate? He chose not to. The injuries among Tesla’s workers aren’t mentioned further. Isaacson does have time for a lot of Steve Jobs comparisons, which, after a while, begin to feel like product placement for his other book. In the index, Jobs is listed as showing up on 20 pages. You’d be forgiven for thinking Jobs was an important part of Musk’s rise, based on the index alone. It’s impossible to escape the conclusion that Musk views everyone around him as disposable. The biography teems with mentions of Musk firing people on the spot, demanding to have things his own way even when it is stupid and expensive, and being unable to tolerate even the slightest dissent. “When Elon gets upset, he lashes out, often at junior people,” Jon McNeill, the former president of Tesla, says.  The later chapters aren’t very revealing “You definitely realize you’re a tool being used to achieve this larger objective and that’s great,” says Lucas Hughes, who worked as a financial analyst at SpaceX and was one of the junior people Musk lashed out at. “But sometimes tools get worn down and he feels he can just replace that tool.” Musk believes that “when people want to prioritize their comfort and leisure they should leave,” Isaacson writes. The later chapters aren’t very revealing. Isaacson is bought in on Musk’s vision of AI and his hinky Tesla Bot. The biographer has swallowed Musk’s hype here wholesale. But I remember the days of the “alien dreadnought,” the promises for swappable batteries that never materialized, and the countless other things Musk said that turned out to be, at best, exaggeration. In 10 years, the big revelation that Musk switched off the Ukrainian internet access during a battle may not be the most embarrassing thing Isaacson has committed to the page. Isaacson wraps up the book by ponderously wondering if Musk’s achievements are possible without his bad behavior:  Would a restrained Musk accomplish as much as a Musk unbound? Is being unfiltered and untethered integral to who he is? Could you get the rockets to orbit or the transition to electric vehicles without accepting all aspects of him, hinged and unhinged? Sometimes great innovators are risk-seeking man-children who resist potty training. This seems to me to be the wrong set of questions. Here are some other ones: If Musk were more receptive to criticism, would his companies be in better shape? If Musk cared more about the team around him, what else could he have accomplished by now? Is achieving the specific vision Musk has for the world worth the injuries he’s inflicted on his workforce? Do we — the readers of Isaacson’s book — want this particular man’s vision of the future at all? While Isaacson manages to detail what makes Musk awful, he seems unaware of what made Musk an inspiring figure for so long. Musk is a fantasist, the kind of person who conceives of civilizations on Mars. That’s what people liked all this time: dreaming big, thinking about new possible worlds. It’s also why Musk’s shifting political stance undercuts him. The fantasy of the conservative movement is small and sad, a limited world with nothing new to explore. Musk has gone from dreaming very, very big to seeming very, very small. In the hands of a talented biographer, this kind of tragic story would provide rich material. Correction 11:00AM ET: The original version of this mischaracterized Musk’s donations — he has donated more than $1 million, not more than $1 billion.

Save One of the world’s richest men, Elon Musk, said he was considering the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish nonprofit that advocates for civil rights and combats antisemitism, for billions of dollars, baselessly accusing the organization of being the “biggest generators of anti-Semitism on” his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. “Since the acquisition, The @ADL has been trying to kill this platform by falsely accusing it & me of being anti-Semitic,” Musk wrote on Monday. “Our US advertising revenue is still down 60%, primarily due to pressure on advertisers by @ADL (that’s what advertisers tell us), so they almost succeeded in killing X/Twitter!” Musk continued, before adding: “If this continues, we will have no choice but to file a defamation suit against, ironically, the ‘Anti-Defamation’ League.” Musk claimed the ADL destroyed “half the value” of X, or “roughly $22 billion,” later adding “I don’t see any scenario where they’re responsible for less than 10% of the value destruction, so ~$4 billion.” ""To be super clear, I’m pro free speech, but against anti-Semitism of any kind,"" Musk wrote in a separate post. He posted dozens of times about the ADL on Monday on the platform and continued to do so on Tuesday. In response to Musk unbanning thousands of accounts and loosening X’s rules on hate speech and bigotry, the ADL joined a coalition with the NAACP and other civil rights organizations that called for advertiser boycotts last year. But since then, the ADL has actually begun advertising itself, telling the Jewish news outlet the Forward in August that they needed to be able to reach people in an environment where extremists and antisemites operate freely. Musk also said on Monday that the lawsuit may take until next week to be filed because his company was short-staffed. And he openly considered publicly publishing all of the ADL’s communications with X before and after he took control. When emailed for comment, X replied with an automatic reply stating “we'll get back to you soon.” Musk has reportedly slashed the communications department after taking over the company; it's unclear if a new department has since been established. In a statement, ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt called Musk's actions ""flat out dangerous and deeply irresponsible,"" calling the lawsuit frivolous and urging ""responsible leaders to lead, to stop inflaming hatred and to step back from the brink before it's too late.” “It is profoundly disturbing that Elon Musk spent the weekend engaging with a highly toxic, antisemitic campaign on his platform -- a campaign started by an unrepentant bigot that then was heavily promoted by individuals such as white supremacist Nick Fuentes, Christian nationalist Andrew Torba, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and others,"" Greenblatt said. ""Finally, we saw the campaign manifest in the real world when masked men marched in Florida on Saturday brazenly waving flags adorned with swastikas and chanting 'Ban the ADL.'"" ""But to be clear, the real issue is neither ADL nor the threat of a frivolous lawsuit,"" Greenblatt continued. ""This urgent matter is the safety of the Jewish people in the face of increasing, intensifying antisemitism. Musk is engaging with and elevating these antisemites at a time when ADL is tracking a surge of bomb threats and swatting attacks of synagogues and Jewish institutions, dramatic levels of antisemitic propaganda being littered throughout Jewish and non-Jewish residential communities, and extremists marching openly through the streets in Nazi gear."" In an earlier statement an ADL spokesperson wrote they believe the “hateful groups” targeting them were angered by a meeting the ADL had with leadership at X last week. Greenblatt had called the meeting with X CEO Linda Yaccarino “frank” and “productive,” claiming she reached out to him. A #BantheADL campaign spread on the platform last week and Musk quickly engaged with the discourse, liking a post from a far-right Irish activist known as Keith Woods calling for the ban on Friday. By Monday, Musk wrote “despite the immense harm ADL has done,” they would only be banned from X if they broke a law. Several far-right figures hailed Musk's discourse. Nick Fuentes — a white supremacist who notably dined with former President Donald Trump last year — said on his livestream that Musk’s decision to sue the ADL “would be probably way better” than just banning the group, adding “this could destroy the ADL as we know it. Really big deal.” Mainstream figures, like former Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller, joined the fray as well. Miller, who is Jewish, described the ADL as “a disreputable organization that has gravely undermined Jewish interests and is worthy of the strongest condemnation"" and baselessly accusing it of being ""an ultra-left activist org."" The Center for Countering Digital Hate has published a series of studies that found hate speech has increased since Elon Musk purchased the platform last year. In July, Musk’s X Corp., the social media platform’s parent company, sued the hate speech watchdog for $10 million, accusing it of “actively working to assert false and misleading claims encouraging advertisers to pause investment on the platform."" “Musk can’t have it both ways. He can’t stand for free speech and then silence critics along the way,” the center posted on X. “He's happy to allow neo-Nazis back on Twitter, but throws a tantrum if someone produces research to evidence the toxicity of his platform.”"

Elon Musk says no primates died as a result of Neuralink's implants. A WIRED investigation now reveals the grisly specifics of their deaths ...","To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. By Dhruv Mehrotra and Dell Cameron Fresh allegations of potential securities fraud have been leveled at Elon Musk over statements he recently made regarding the deaths of primates used for research at Neuralink, his biotech startup. Letters sent this afternoon to top officials at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by a medical ethics group call on the agency to investigate Musk’s claims that monkeys who died during trials at the company were terminally ill and did not die as a result of Neuralink implants. They claim, based on veterinary records, that complications with the implant procedures led to their deaths. Musk first acknowledged the deaths of the macaques on September 10 in a reply to a user on his social networking app X (formerly Twitter). He denied that any of the deaths were “a result of a Neuralink implant” and said the researchers had taken care to select subjects who were already “close to death.” Relatedly, in a presentation last fall Musk claimed that Neuralink’s animal testing was never “exploratory,” but was instead conducted to confirm fully formed scientific hypotheses. “We are extremely careful,” he said. Public records reviewed by WIRED, and interviews conducted with a former Neuralink employee and a current researcher at the University of California, Davis primate center, paint a wholly different picture of Neuralink’s animal research. The documents include veterinary records, first made public last year, that contain gruesome portrayals of suffering reportedly endured by as many as a dozen of Neuralink’s primate subjects, all of whom needed to be euthanized. These records could serve as the basis for any potential SEC probe into Musk’s comments about Neuralink, which has faced multiple federal investigations as the company moves toward its goal of releasing the first commercially available brain-computer interface for humans. The letters to the SEC come from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a nonprofit striving to abolish live animal testing. The group claims that Musk’s comments about the primate deaths were misleading, that he knew them “to be false,” and that investors deserve to hear the truth about the safety, “and thus the marketability,” of Neuralink’s speculative product. “They are claiming they are going to put a safe device on the market, and that’s why you should invest,” Ryan Merkley, who leads the Physicians Committee’s research into animal-testing alternatives, tells WIRED. “And we see his lie as a way to whitewash what happened in these exploratory studies.” Are you a current or former employee at Neuralink? We’d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact Dhruv Mehrotra at dhruv_mehrotra@wired.com or securely at dhruv@riseup.net. Musk’s post on X about Neuralink’s monkeys has been viewed more than 760,000 times, and the Physicians Committee notes in its letters that when the SEC charged Musk with securities fraud related to Tesla in 2018, the agency argued that his account was a source of investor news. The SEC has jurisdiction over the sale of any securities, including those offered by privately held companies such as Neuralink. Recent filings show the company has raised more than $280 million from outside investors. The SEC declined WIRED’s request to comment on the Physicians Committee’s letters. Neuralink did not respond to specific questions about Musk’s claims or a request for comment about the Physicians Committee’s allegations. Within a year of its reported founding in March 2017, Neuralink acquired a large number of animal subjects to test its brain-chip implants. From September 2017 until late 2020, the company’s experiments were aided by the staff of the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), a federally funded bioresearch facility at UC Davis. Musk’s promise was to revolutionize prostheses and engineer an implant that would allow human brains to communicate wirelessly with artificial devices, and even each other. Angela Watercutter Andy Greenberg Gregory Barber Garrett M. Graff UC Davis veterinary records cited by the Physicians Committee—which WIRED also obtained through a subsequent California public records request—chronicle a battery of complications that developed following procedures involving electrodes being surgically implanted into monkeys’ brains. The complications include bloody diarrhea, partial paralysis, and cerebral edema, a condition colloquially known as “brain swelling.” For example, in an experimental surgery that took place in December 2019, performed to determine the “survivability” of an implant, an internal part of the device “broke off” while being implanted. Overnight, researchers observed the monkey, identified only as “Animal 20” by UC Davis, scratching at the surgical site, which emitted a bloody discharge, and yanking on a connector that eventually dislodged part of the device. A surgery to repair the issue was carried out the following day, yet fungal and bacterial infections took root. Vet records note that neither infection was likely to be cleared, in part because the implant was covering the infected area. The monkey was euthanized on January 6, 2020. Additional veterinary reports show the condition of a female monkey called “Animal 15” during the months leading up to her death in March 2019. Days after her implant surgery, she began to press her head against the floor for no apparent reason; a symptom of pain or infection, the records say. Staff observed that though she was uncomfortable, picking and pulling at her implant until it bled, she would often lie at the foot of her cage and spend time holding hands with her roommate. Animal 15 began to lose coordination, and staff observed that she would shake uncontrollably when she saw lab workers. Her condition deteriorated for months until the staff finally euthanized her. A necropsy report indicates that she had bleeding in her brain and that the Neuralink implants left parts of her cerebral cortex “focally tattered.” Yet another monkey, Animal 22, was euthanized in March 2020 after his cranial implant became loose. A necropsy report revealed that two of the screws securing the implant to the skull loosened to the extent that they “could easily be lifted out.” The necropsy for Animal 22 clearly states that “the failure of this implant can be considered purely mechanical and not exacerbated by infection.” If true, this would appear to directly contradict Musk’s statement that no monkeys died as a result of Neuralink’s chips. Angela Watercutter Andy Greenberg Gregory Barber Garrett M. Graff Shown a copy of Musk’s remarks on X about Neuralink’s animal subjects being “close to death already,” a former Neuralink employee alleges to WIRED that the claim is “ridiculous,” if not a “straight fabrication.” “We had these monkeys for a year or so before any surgery was performed,” they say. The ex-employee, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, says that up to a year’s worth of behavioral training was necessary for the program, a time frame that would exempt subjects already close to death. A doctoral candidate currently conducting research at the CNPRC, granted anonymity due to a fear of professional retaliation, likewise questions Musk’s claim regarding the baseline health of Neutralink’s monkeys. “These are pretty young monkeys,” they tell WIRED. “It’s hard to imagine these monkeys, who were not adults, were terminal for some reason.” “We have no comment to make regarding Elon Musk’s statements,” Andy Fell, a spokesperson for the Davis campus, tells WIRED. If the SEC does investigate Musk’s comments, it would mark at least the third federal probe linked to Neuralink’s animal testing. In December 2022, Reuters reported that the US Department of Agriculture’s Office of Inspector General had launched a probe into Neuralink’s treatment of some animal test subjects. In February 2023, the US Department of Transportation opened an investigation into Neuralink over allegations of unsafe transport of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. These investigations followed the US Food and Drug Administration initially rejecting Neuralink’s application, in early 2022, for approval to conduct in-human clinical trials. According to Reuters, the agency’s major concerns involved the device’s lithium battery, as well the possibility that the implant’s wires might migrate to other parts of the brain. This May, the FDA gave the company approval for human trials. Those human trials could begin soon. Yesterday, Neuralink announced that it had received approval from an independent review board to begin a study aiming to enable people with paralysis to control a computer keyboard or cursor with their thoughts. Updated at 4:50 pm ET, September 20, 2023, to reflect that it is unclear from the vet records related to “Animal 20” whether the term “survivability” refers to the implant or the test subject.  📨 Make the most of chatbots with our AI Unlocked newsletter Taylor Swift, Star Wars, Stranger Things, and Deadpool have one man in common Generative AI is playing a surprising role in Israel-Hamas disinformation The new era of social media looks as bad for privacy as the last one Johnny Cash’s Taylor Swift cover predicts the boring future of AI music Your internet browser does not belong to you 🔌 Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters, power banks, and USB hubs Matt Reynolds Aarian Marshall Aarian Marshall Vittoria Elliott Caitlin Harrington Caitlin Harrington Aarian Marshall Will Knight More From WIRED Contact © 2023 Condé Nast.

https://fortune.com/2023/09/06/elon-musk-x-what-is-twitter-worth/,"X could be worth just $4 billion now, according to Elon Musk's math ...",20230901,"Sep 6, 2023 ... According to Elon Musk's own math, the company formerly known as Twitter has lost 90% of its value and could be worth just $4 billion · Related ...","Elon Musk says the most outrageous things. But the message he posted at 7:04 p.m. on Labor Day evening may rank as the most negative, in fact self-indicting, assessment a corporate leader has ever issued about their own enterprise. Musk fired off this head-spinning salvo in his attack on the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish-led organization civil rights organization. The ADL had strongly objected to virulently anti-Semitic tweets from far-right hate groups that X permitted on the platform. Musk charged that the ADL was “aggressive in their demands to ban social media accounts even for minor infractions,” and that the organization was “trying to kill X” by pressing advertisers to avoid the site. But the most mystifying feature wasn’t that, once again, Musk shot off his mouth and hit his foot, but that he actually put a number on the financial damage allegedly inflicted by the ADL that’s likely to floor his partners and lenders.  His astounding math applies to the present value of the business formerly known as Twitter. Musk’s said many times since he purchased the platform last October that its worth has plummeted, largely via a disastrous drop in ad revenue. Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion, funded $13 billion by loans from big-name commercial and investment banks, and $31 billion in equity. Of the latter portion, Musk contributed about $24 billion of his own cash, while a group of investor friends including Larry Ellison, Ron Baron, and Prince Al Waleed of Saudi Arabia provided $7 billion. In the post, Musk charges that “ADL seems responsible for most of our revenue loss” and adds, “I don’t see any scenario where they’re responsible for less than 10% of the value destruction, so around $4 billion.” It’s logical to assume that by “value,” Musk means the $44 billion paid for the property, not the equity portion. After all, if you bought a house for $440,000, borrowed $130,000, and funded the remaining $310,000 in cash, and the price fell, you’d calculate the fall in “value” based in how much less than $440,000 the dwelling would fetch today. In Musk’s reckoning, the ADL singlehandedly vaporized roughly $4 billion in X’s “value,” and that $4 billion accounts for around 10% of the entire decline in the franchise’s worth. That formula puts the total fall at $40 billion. Since Musk and partners paid $44 billion including debt, he’s implying that the platform would now change hands for $4 billion (the $44 billion purchase price minus the $40 billion in “value destruction”), for a drop of 90%. In effect, he’s saying that the $31 billion he and his partners invested in equity is totally gone, and a big portion of the debt from provided by the cream of Wall Street sits far underwater.  Does Elon Musk really believe that X is now worth $4 billion, as his scorching post suggests? Maybe not. But he’s just inflicted still another battering on his already beleaguered brand that will further undermine its standing in the eyes of advertisers. His view may be that it’s acceptable to exaggerate the pain and throw around numbers when you’re the victim, when it’s somebody else’s fault. If X indeed proves a financial cataclysm, people are likely to forget the excuses, and examine the careening missteps from its mercurial sole proprietor.  © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited.

                  Jared Isaacman, founder and CEO of Shift4 who commanded the Inspiration4 mission, announced today the Polaris Program, a first-of-its-kind effort to rapidly advance human spaceflight capabilities, while continuing to raise funds and awareness for important causes here on Earth. The program will consist of up to three human spaceflight missions that will demonstrate new technologies, conduct extensive research, and ultimately culminate in the first flight of SpaceX’s Starship with humans on board.
                   
                  The first mission, Polaris Dawn, is targeted to launch no earlier than the fourth quarter of 2022 from historic Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This Dragon mission will take advantage of Falcon 9 and Dragon’s maximum performance, flying higher than any Dragon mission to date and endeavoring to reach the highest Earth orbit ever flown. Dragon and the Polaris Dawn crew will spend up to five days in orbit, during which the crew will attempt the first-ever commercial spacewalk, conduct scientific research designed to advance both human health on Earth and our understanding of human health during future long-duration spaceflights, and be the first crew to test Starlink laser-based communications in space, providing valuable data for future space communications systems necessary for missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.
                   
                  The Polaris Dawn mission has many first-time objectives, so the Polaris Program chose a crew of experts who know each other well and have a foundation of trust they can build upon as they undergo the challenges of this mission. In addition to Isaacman, the crew includes Scott “Kidd” Poteet, a veteran member of Jared’s team, and two SpaceX employees, Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon.
                   
                  On Thursday, February 10 from Starbase in Texas, SpaceX Chief Engineer Elon Musk provided an update on the development of Starship, a fully reusable transportation system capable of carrying passengers and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond.
                   
                  On Thursday, February 3 at 1:13 p.m. EST, Falcon 9 launched 49 Starlink satellites to low Earth orbit from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Falcon 9’s second stage deployed the satellites into their intended orbit, with a perigee of approximately 210 kilometers above Earth, and each satellite achieved controlled flight.
                   
                  SpaceX deploys its satellites into these lower orbits so that in the very rare case any satellite does not pass initial system checkouts it will quickly be deorbited by atmospheric drag. While the low deployment altitude requires more capable satellites at a considerable cost to us, it’s the right thing to do to maintain a sustainable space environment.
                   
                  Unfortunately, the satellites deployed on Thursday were significantly impacted by a geomagnetic storm on Friday. These storms cause the atmosphere to warm and atmospheric density at our low deployment altitudes to increase. In fact, onboard GPS suggests the escalation speed and severity of the storm caused atmospheric drag to increase up to 50 percent higher than during previous launches. The Starlink team commanded the satellites into a safe-mode where they would fly edge-on (like a sheet of paper) to minimize drag—to effectively “take cover from the storm”—and continued to work closely with the Space Force’s 18th Space Control Squadron and LeoLabs to provide updates on the satellites based on ground radars.
                   
                  Preliminary analysis show the increased drag at the low altitudes prevented the satellites from leaving safe-mode to begin orbit raising maneuvers, and up to 40 of the satellites will reenter or already have reentered the Earth’s atmosphere. The deorbiting satellites pose zero collision risk with other satellites and by design demise upon atmospheric reentry—meaning no orbital debris is created and no satellite parts hit the ground. This unique situation demonstrates the great lengths the Starlink team has gone to ensure the system is on the leading edge of on-orbit debris mitigation.
                   On Tuesday, November 23 at 10:21 p.m. PST, Falcon 9 launched NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission to an interplanetary transfer orbit from Space Launch Complex 4 East (SLC-4E) at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. DART is humanity’s first planetary defense test mission to see if intentionally crashing a spacecraft into an asteroid is an effective way to change its course, should an Earth-threatening asteroid be discovered in the future. This was SpaceX’s first inter-planetary mission. This was the third flight for this Falcon 9’s first stage booster, which previously supported launch of Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich and a Starlink mission. On Thursday, November 11 at 6:32 p.m. EST, 23:32 UTC, SpaceX’s Dragon autonomously docked with the International Space Station. Falcon 9 launched the spacecraft to orbit from histsoric Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday, November 10 at 9:03 p.m. EST. On Thursday, November 11 at 6:32 p.m. EST, 23:32 UTC, SpaceX’s Dragon autonomously docked with the International Space Station. Falcon 9 launched the spacecraft to orbit from histsoric Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday, November 10 at 9:03 p.m. EST. After 199 days in space, the longest-duration mission for a U.S. spacecraft, Dragon and the Crew-2 astronauts, Shane Kimbrough , Megan McArthur , Akihiko Hoshide , and Thomas Pesquet , returned to Earth, splashing down off the coast of Pensacola, Florida at 10:33 p.m. EST on November 8. Dragon and the Crew-2 astronauts were quickly recovered by the SpaceX recovery team. SpaceX will transport Dragon back to Cape Canaveral, Florida for inspections and refurbishment ahead of future human spaceflight missions. This mission marked multiple firsts for SpaceX and NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, including being the first to fly two international partners, the first crew mission to use a flight-proven Dragon and Falcon 9, and the first U.S. spacecraft to spend 199 consecutive days in orbit. After three days orbiting Earth, Dragon and the Inspiration4 crew – the world’s first civilian mission to orbit – safely splashed down off the coast of Florida at 7:06 p.m. EDT on Saturday, September 18, 2021, completing their first multi-day low Earth orbit mission. Dragon performed a series of departure phasing burns to leave the circular orbit of 575 kilometers and then jettisoned its trunk ahead of its deorbit burn. After re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere, the spacecraft deployed its two drogue and four main parachutes in preparation for the soft water landing.  Inspiration4 is commanded by Jared Isaacman, founder and CEO of Shift4 Payments and an accomplished pilot and adventurer. Joining him are Medical Officer Hayley Arceneaux, a physician assistant at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital® and pediatric cancer survivor; Mission Specialist Chris Sembroski, an Air Force veteran and aerospace data engineer; and Mission Pilot Dr. Sian Proctor, a geoscientist, entrepreneur, and trained pilot. Developed by SpaceX to support NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, Dragon helped return human spaceflight capabilities in 2020 and has successfully flown three human spaceflight missions to the International Space Station (ISS) to-date. In addition to flying astronauts to space for NASA, Dragon can also carry commercial astronauts to Earth orbit, the ISS or beyond. Today, Axiom Space announced SpaceX will fly three additional private crew missions aboard Dragon to and from the Station through 2023. Axiom previously announced their first mission to the International Space Station flying aboard Dragon, currently targeted to liftoff no earlier than January 2022. In May 2021, Axiom announced that astronaut Peggy Whitson and champion GT racer John Shoffner will serve as commander and pilot on the Ax-2 mission . All four crews will receive combined commercial astronaut training from NASA and SpaceX, with SpaceX providing training on the Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft, emergency preparedness training, spacesuit and spacecraft ingress and egress exercises, as well as partial and full simulations. The growing partnership between Axiom and SpaceX will enable more opportunities for more humans in space on the road to making humanity multiplanetary. On Wednesday, May 5, Starship serial number 15 (SN15) successfully completed SpaceX’s fifth high-altitude flight test of a Starship prototype from Starbase in Texas. Similar to previous high-altitude flight tests of Starship , SN15 was powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee – approximately 10 km in altitude. SN15 performed a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent. The Starship prototype descended under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps were actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship’s attitude during flight and enabled precise landing at the intended location. SN15’s Raptor engines reignited as the vehicle performed the landing flip maneuver immediately before touching down for a nominal landing on the pad. These test flights of Starship are all about improving our understanding and development of a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration interplanetary flights, and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond. Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on SN15’s successful flight and landing! After 167 days in space, the longest duration mission for a U.S. spacecraft since the final Skylab mission in 1974, Dragon and the Crew-1 astronauts, Mike Hopkins , Victor Glover , Shannon Walker , and Soichi Noguchi , returned to Earth on Sunday, May 2, 2021. Dragon autonomously undocked from the International Space Station at 8:35 p.m. EDT on Saturday, May 1. The spacecraft performed a series of departure burns to move away from the orbiting laboratory. Before reentry, Dragon jettisoned its trunk to reduce weight and mass to help save propellant for the deorbit burn. The spacecraft then re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere and deployed its two drogue and four main parachutes in preparation for the soft water landing. Approximately 6.5 hours after undocking, Dragon splashed down off the coast of Florida at 2:56 a.m. EDT on Sunday, May 2, completing the spacecraft’s first long-duration operational mission. This was also the first nighttime splashdown of a U.S. spacecraft with crew on board since Apollo 8’s return in 1968. Upon splashdown, Dragon and the Crew-1 astronauts were quickly recovered by the SpaceX recovery team. SpaceX will transport Dragon back to Cape Canaveral for inspections and refurbishment ahead of future human spaceflight missions. On Saturday, April 24 at 5:08 a.m. EDT, 9:08 UTC, SpaceX’s Dragon autonomously docked with the International Space Station (ISS) after Falcon 9 launched the spacecraft to orbit from historic Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday, April 23 at 5:49 a.m. EDT, 9:49 UTC. This is the first human spaceflight mission to fly astronauts on a flight-proven Falcon 9 and Dragon. The Falcon 9 first stage supporting this mission previously launched the Crew-1 mission in November 2020, and the Dragon spacecraft previously flew Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley to and from the International Space Station during SpaceX’s Demo-2 mission in 2020. As part of the Commercial Crew Program, NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur , Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Akihiko Hoshide , and European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Thomas Pesquet flew aboard the Dragon spacecraft on its second operational mission to the space station. This was the first time Dragon flew two international partners and also the first time two Crew Dragons are attached simultaneously to the orbiting laboratory. After an approximate six-month stay, Dragon and the Crew-2 astronauts will depart from the space station no earlier than October 31 for return to Earth and splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida. Only 24 humans have been to the Moon, and no one has been back since 1972. Today, NASA announced they have selected Starship to land the first astronauts on the lunar surface since the Apollo program. We are humbled to help NASA usher in a new era of human space exploration. Together, NASA and SpaceX have successfully executed similarly bold and innovative partnerships, including restoring America’s ability to launch astronauts to orbit and return them safely home. We will build upon our shared accomplishments, and leverage years of close technical collaboration to return to the Moon. In doing so, we will lay the groundwork for human exploration to Mars and beyond. Sustaining a human presence on the Moon will require the safe and affordable transportation of crew and significant amounts of cargo. SpaceX’s Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket represent an integrated and fully reusable launch, propellant delivery, rendezvous, and planetary lander system with robust capabilities and safety features uniquely designed to deliver these essential building blocks. Flying between lunar orbit and the surface of the Moon, Starship will carry crew and all of the supplies, equipment, and science payloads needed for extensive surface exploration. Building off the safety and reliability of Dragon and Falcon, Starship will feature proven avionics, guidance and navigation systems, autonomous rendezvous, docking and precision landing capabilities, as well as thermal protection, and a spacious cabin with familiar displays and interfaces utilized on Dragon . SpaceX is rapidly advancing Starship development, drawing on an extensive history of launch vehicle and engine development programs. Since January 2020, SpaceX has built 10 Starship prototypes, with production and fidelity accelerating on each build. SpaceX has manufactured and tested more than 60 of Starship’s Raptor engines, accumulating nearly 30,000 seconds of total test time over 567 engine starts, including on multiple Starship static fires and flight tests. We have conducted six suborbital flight tests, including two 150-m hops and four high-altitude flights. SpaceX has also built a full-size Super Heavy booster as part of a pathfinder effort, and currently has five vehicles in production. We are honored to be a part of NASA’s Artemis Program to safely land the first woman and next man on the surface of the Moon, as the first of many, many more people to follow. On Tuesday, March 30, SpaceX launched its fourth high-altitude flight test of Starship from Starbase in Texas. Similar to previous high-altitude flight tests, Starship Serial Number 11 (SN11) was powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee – approximately 10 km in altitude. SN11 performed a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent. Shortly after the landing burn started, SN11 experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly. Teams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test. Test flights are all about improving our understanding and development of a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration interplanetary flights, and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond. On Wednesday, March 3, Starship serial number (SN10) successfully completed SpaceX’s third high-altitude flight test of a Starship prototype from our site in Cameron County, Texas. Similar to the high-altitude flight tests of Starship SN8 and SN9 , SN10 was powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee – approximately 10 km in altitude. SN10 performed a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent. The Starship prototype descended under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps were actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship’s attitude during flight and enabled a precise landing at the intended location. SN10’s Raptor engines reignited as the vehicle performed the landing flip maneuver immediately before successfully touching down on the landing pad! As if the flight test was not exciting enough, SN10 experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly shortly after landing. All in all a great day for the Starship teams – these test flights are all about improving our understanding and development of a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration interplanetary flights, and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond. Congratulations to the entire Starship and SpaceX teams on the flight test! In 2018, Japanese entrepreneur, Yusaku Maezawa, announced the world’s first private passenger mission to fly by the Moon aboard Starship . Known as dearMoon, this mission is an important step toward enabling access for people who dream of traveling to space. Today, the dearMoon project opened the application process for eight civilians to join Yusaku Maezawa on the week-long Starship mission around the Moon in 2023. Visit the dearMoon website or watch the video above to learn more on how to apply and potentially become a dearMoon crew member! On Tuesday, February 2, Starship serial number 9 (SN9) completed SpaceX’s second high-altitude flight test of a Starship prototype from our site in Cameron County, Texas. Similar to the high-altitude flight test of Starship serial number 8 (SN8) , SN9 was powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee – approximately 10 kilometers in altitude. SN9 successfully performed a propellant transition to the internal header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent. The Starship prototype descended under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps are actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship’s attitude during flight and enable precise landing at the intended location. During the landing flip maneuver, one of the Raptor engines did not relight and caused SN9 to land at high speed and experience a RUD. These test flights are all about improving our understanding and development of a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration, interplanetary flights and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to Mars and beyond. In 2020, SpaceX returned America’s ability to fly NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station for the first time since the Space Shuttle’s last flight in 2011. In addition to flying astronauts for NASA, Dragon was also designed to carry commercial astronauts to Earth orbit, the space station, or beyond. Today, it was announced SpaceX is targeting no earlier than the fourth quarter of this year for Falcon 9’s launch of Inspiration4 – the world’s first all-commercial astronaut mission to orbit – from historic Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Jared Isaacman, founder and CEO of Shift4 Payments, is donating the three seats alongside him aboard Dragon to individuals from the general public who will be announced in the weeks ahead. Learn more on how to potentially join this historic journey to space by visiting Inspiration4.com . The Inspiration4 crew will receive commercial astronaut training by SpaceX on the Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft, orbital mechanics, operating in microgravity, zero gravity, and other forms of stress testing. They will go through emergency preparedness training, spacesuit and spacecraft ingress and egress exercises, as well as partial and full mission simulations. This multi-day journey, orbiting Earth every 90 minutes along a customized flight path, will be carefully monitored at every step by SpaceX mission control. Upon conclusion of the mission, Dragon will reenter Earth’s atmosphere for a soft water landing off the coast of Florida. On Wednesday, December 9, Starship serial number 8 (SN8) lifted off from our Cameron County launch pad and successfully ascended, transitioned propellant, and performed its landing flip maneuver with precise flap control to reach its landing point. Low pressure in the fuel header tank during the landing burn led to high touchdown velocity resulting in a hard (and exciting!) landing. Re-watch SN8's flight here.  Thank you to all the locals supporting our efforts in Cameron County and beyond. Congratulations to the entire Starship and SpaceX teams on today’s test! Serial number 9 (SN9) is up next – Mars, here we come! On Monday, November 16 at 11:01 p.m. EST, 04:01 UTC on November 17, SpaceX’s Dragon autonomously docked with the International Space Station (ISS) after Falcon 9 launched the spacecraft to orbit from historic Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sunday, November 15, 2020. As part of the Commercial Crew Program, NASA astronauts Mike Hopkins , Victor Glover , Shannon Walker , and JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi flew aboard Dragon on its first six-month operational mission to the space station. After its approximately six-month stay at the orbiting laboratory, Dragon and the astronauts will return to Earth and splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida. Following Dragon’s second demonstration mission (Demo-2), NASA certified SpaceX for operational crew missions to and from the space station. Crew-1 is the first of three scheduled Dragon human spaceflights over the course of 2020 and 2021. The return of human spaceflight to the United States with one of the safest, most advanced systems ever built is a turning point for America’s future space exploration, and it lays the groundwork for missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Today, NASA announced it has certified SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon human spaceflight system for crew missions to and from the International Space Station – the first commercial system in history to achieve such designation. Not since the certification of the space shuttle nearly 40 years ago has NASA certified a spacecraft, rocket, and ground support systems for regular flights with astronauts. Launched atop Falcon 9 on May 30, 2020, Dragon 's second demonstration flight test to and from the space station restored human spaceflight to the United States for the first time in almost a decade. That flight was the culmination of years of development, testing, and training—all throughout safety remained SpaceX’s top priority. SpaceX put every component of every system through its paces, including two flight tests to and from the International Space Station, demonstrations of Dragon’s escape system both on the launch pad and in-flight, over 700 tests of the spacecraft's SuperDraco engines, more than 500 joint soft-capture docking tests to validate the performance of Dragon’s docking system design, about 8,000,000 hours of hardware in the loop software testing, and nearly 100 tests and flights of Dragon’s parachutes to ensure a safe landing back on Earth—in addition to all of the knowledge gained from twenty previous successful cargo resupply missions to the space station and over forty Falcon 9 block 5 launches. SpaceX and NASA are targeting Saturday, November 14 at 7:49 p.m. EST for the launch of the first crew rotation mission (Crew-1) to the International Space Station as part of the agency’s Commercial Crew Program. The Crew-1 mission will launch NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins , Victor Glover , and Shannon Walker , along with Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) mission specialist Soichi Noguchi , from historic Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Human spaceflight is SpaceX’s core mission, and we take seriously the responsibility that NASA has entrusted in us to safely carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. We are humbled to help NASA usher in a new era of space exploration. On Saturday, October 24 at 11:31 a.m. EDT, 11:31 UTC, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket launched 60 Starlink satellites to orbit from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Falcon 9’s first stage previously supported the GPS III Space Vehicle 03 mission in June 2020 and a Starlink mission in September 2020. Following stage separation, SpaceX landed Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Just Read the Instructions” droneship, which was stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. The Starlink satellites deployed approximately 1 hour and 3 minutes after liftoff. If you would like to receive updates on Starlink news and service availability in your area, please visit starlink.com . This mission also marked the 100th successful flight of a Falcon rocket since Falcon 1 first flew to orbit in 2008. SpaceX believes that fully and rapidly reusable rockets are the pivotal breakthrough needed to dramatically reduce the cost of access to space to enable people to travel to and live on other planets. While most rockets are expendable after launch — akin to throwing away an airplane after a one-way trip from Los Angeles to New York — SpaceX is working toward a future in which reusable rockets are the norm. Of its now 100 successful flights of Falcon rockets, SpaceX has landed a Falcon first stage rocket booster 63 times and re-flown boosters 45 times. This year, SpaceX twice accomplished the sixth flight of an orbital rocket booster. And, in the ten years since its demonstration mission, Falcon 9 has become the most-flown operational rocket in the United States, overtaking expendable rockets that have been launching for decades. The difficulty of precision landing an orbital rocket after it reenters Earth’s atmosphere at hypersonic velocity is not to be overlooked — SpaceX remains the only launch provider in the world capable of accomplishing this task. At 14 stories tall and traveling upwards of 1300 m/s (nearly 1 mi/s), stabilizing Falcon 9’s first stage booster for landing is like trying to balance a rubber broomstick on your hand in the middle of a hurricane. While recovery and re-flight of an orbital rocket booster may now seem routine, developing Falcon such that it would withstand reentry and return for landing was generally accepted as impossible — and SpaceX learned many lessons on the road to reusability . SpaceX’s accomplishments with flight-proven rockets and spacecraft have allowed us to further advance the fleet’s reliability and reusability, as well as inform the development of Starship — SpaceX’s next-generation fully and rapidly reusable super heavy lift transportation system. Starship’s capability of full and rapid reuse will lower the cost of spaceflight to help humanity return to the Moon, travel to Mars, and ultimately become multi-planetary. Ahead of Falcon 9’s upcoming launch of GPS III-4, the United States Space Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) announced today an agreement with SpaceX to recover the first stage booster and, for the first time on a National Security Space Launch (NSSL) mission, launch previously flown boosters on future GPS missions. SpaceX is proud to leverage its flight-proven capabilities toward national security space launch missions. SpaceX was also recently selected by the Space Force to carry out critical National Security Space Launch (NSSL) missions ordered over the next five years. SpaceX will build upon our years-long collaboration with the United States Air Force and the National Reconnaissance Office to utilize the operationally mature Falcon fleet, which has achieved NSSL certification and completed a combined 95 orbital missions to date for a variety of customers. With Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy , SpaceX is capable of performing every type of national security space mission, to every required reference orbit, with significant performance and schedule margin. To meet or exceed the demanding and unique requirements of the NSSL program, SpaceX invested over a billion dollars of its own money into the Falcon fleet and the associated ground infrastructure, manufacturing processes, payload integration procedures, and mission assurance processes. This private investment over multiple years reflects SpaceX’s deep commitment to reliably launching our customers' payloads to orbit. And, as SpaceX brought competition back to national security space launch, the United States Air Force saved billions in critical taxpayer funds. SpaceX is honored to support the United States Space Force with a solution given the highest possible rating for system capability, schedule readiness, and system risk, using a mix of new and flight-proven launch vehicles. We look forward to leveraging this extensive capability to continue delivering the country’s most reliable and affordable launch services for years to come. On Tuesday, August 4 at 4:56 p.m. CDT in Boca Chica, Texas, Starship serial number 5 (SN5) lifted-off from its launch mount and flew to a height of 150 meters before successfully touching down on a near-by landing pad. On this flight test, SN5 was powered by a single Raptor engine – a reusable methalox full-flow staged-combustion rocket engine. This test flight was an important step in development of SpaceX’s fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and beyond. On Saturday, May 30, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 launched Crew Dragon’s second demonstration (Demo-2) mission from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley aboard the spacecraft. Dragon autonomously docked to the International Space Station on Sunday, May 31, 2020. Sixty-three days later, Crew Dragon undocked and departed from the orbiting laboratory, before successfully splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Pensacola, Florida on Sunday, August 2 at 2:48 p.m. EDT. This test flight marked the return of human spaceflight to the United States and the first-time in history a commercial company successfully took astronauts to orbit and back. The Demo-2 mission was also the final major test milestone for SpaceX’s human spaceflight system to be certified by NASA for operational crew missions to and from the International Space Station. With the Demo-2 mission now complete, SpaceX and NASA teams are reviewing all the data for certification before NASA astronauts Victor Glover, Mike Hopkins, Shannon Walker, and JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi fly on Dragon’s first six-month operational mission (Crew-1), targeted for late September. On Saturday, May 30 at 3:22 p.m. EDT, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 launched Crew Dragon’s second demonstration (Demo-2) mission from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and the next day Crew Dragon autonomously docked to the International Space Station. This test flight with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley on board the Dragon spacecraft returned human spaceflight to the United States. Demo-2 is the final major test for SpaceX’s human spaceflight system to be certified by NASA for operational crew missions to and from the International Space Station. SpaceX is returning human spaceflight to the United States with one of the safest, most advanced systems ever built, and NASA’s Commercial Crew Program is a turning point for America’s future in space exploration that lays the groundwork for future missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. SpaceX is launching Starlink to provide high-speed, low-latency broadband connectivity across the globe, including to locations where internet has traditionally been too expensive, unreliable, or entirely unavailable. We also firmly believe in the importance of a natural night sky for all of us to enjoy, which is why we have been working with leading astronomers around the world to better understand the specifics of their observations and engineering changes we can make to reduce satellite brightness. Our goals include: Making the satellites generally invisible to the naked eye within a week of launch. We're doing this by changing the way the satellites fly to their operational altitude, so that they fly with the satellite knife-edge to the Sun. We are working on implementing this as soon as possible for all satellites since it is a software change. Minimizing Starlink's impact on astronomy by darkening satellites so they do not saturate observatory detectors. We're accomplishing this by adding a deployable visor to the satellite to block sunlight from hitting the brightest parts of the spacecraft. The first unit is flying on the next launch, and by flight 9 in June all future Starlink satellites will have sun visors. Additionally, information about our satellites' orbits are located on space-track.org to facilitate observation scheduling for astronomers. We are interested in feedback on ways to improve the utility and timeliness of this information. To better explain the details of brightness mitigation efforts, we need to explain more about how the Starlink satellites work. Starlink Orbits Starlink has three phases of flight: (1) orbit raise, (2) parking orbit (380 km above Earth), and (3) on-station (550 km above Earth). During orbit raise the satellites use their thrusters to raise altitude over the course of a few weeks. Some of the satellites go directly to station while others pause in the parking orbit to allow the satellites to precess to a different orbital plane. Once satellites are on-station they reconfigure so the antennas face Earth and the solar array goes vertical so that it can track the Sun to maximize power generation. As a result of this maneuver, the satellites become much darker because the solar array visibility from the ground is greatly reduced. Currently, about half of the over 400 satellites are on-station and the other half are orbit raising or in the parking orbit. Satellites spend a small fraction of their lives orbit raising or parking and spend the vast majority of their lives on-station. It's important to note that at any given time, only about several hundred satellites will be orbit raising or parking. The rest of the satellites will be in the operational orbit on-station. Starlink Satellite The Starlink satellite design was driven by the fact that they fly at a very low altitude compared to other communications satellites. We do this to prioritize space traffic safety and to minimize the latency of the signal between the satellite and the users who are getting internet service from it. Because of the low altitude, drag is a major factor in the design. During orbit raise, the satellites must minimize their cross-sectional area relative to the 'wind,' otherwise drag will cause them to fall out of orbit. High drag is a double-edged sword—it means that flying the satellites is tricky, but it also means that any satellites that are experiencing problems will de-orbit quickly and safely burn up in the atmosphere. This reduces the amount of orbital debris or 'space junk' in orbit. This low-drag and thrusting flight configuration resembles an open book, where the solar array is laid out flat in front of the vehicle. When Starlink satellites are orbit raising, they roll to a limited extent about the velocity vector for power generation, always keeping the cross sectional area minimized while keeping the antennas facing Earth enough to stay in contact with the ground stations. When the satellites reach their operational orbit of 550 km, drag is still a factor—so any inoperable satellite will quickly decay—but the attitude control system is able to overcome this drag with the solar array raised above the satellite in a vertical orientation that we call 'shark-fin.' This is the orientation in which the satellite spends the majority of its operational life. Satellite Visibility Satellites are visible from the ground at sunrise or sunset. This happens because the satellites are illuminated by the Sun but people or telescopes on the ground are in the dark. These conditions only happen for a fraction of Starlink's 90-minute orbit. This simple diagram highlights why satellites in orbit raise are so much brighter than the satellites that are on-station. During orbit raise, when the solar array is in open book, sunlight can reflect off of both the solar array and the body of the satellite and hit the ground. Once on-station, only certain parts of the chassis can reflect light to the ground. Physics of Satellite Brightness The apparent magnitude of an object is a measure of the brightness of a star or object observed from Earth. It is a reverse logarithmic scale, so higher numbers correspond to dimmer objects. A star of magnitude 3 is approximately 2.5 times brighter than a star of magnitude 4. Based on observations that have been taken by us and by members of the astronomical community, current Starlink satellites have an average apparent magnitude of 5.5 when on-station and brighter during orbit raise. Objects up to about magnitude 6.5-7 are visible to the naked eye (naked-eye visibility is closer to 4 in most suburbs), and our goal is for Starlink satellites to be magnitude 7 or better for almost all phases of their mission. There are two types of reflections off of Starlink satellites: diffuse and specular. Diffuse reflections occur when light is scattered in many different directions. Imagine shining a flashlight at a white wall. Specular reflections happen when light is reflected in a particular direction. For example, the glint of sunlight off of a mirror. Diffuse reflections are the biggest contributor to observed brightness on the ground, because diffuse reflections go in all directions. You can see diffuse reflections as long as the satellite is visible. This is why Starlink satellites can create the 'string of pearls' effect in the night sky. It's a little counter-intuitive, but the shiny components of the Starlink satellites are a much smaller problem. Whether diffuse or specular, having a high reflectance helps the satellites stay cool in space. When sunlight hits a specular surface of the spacecraft and reflects, the vast majority of light reflects in the specular (mirror reflection) direction, which is generally out toward space (not toward Earth). Occasionally when it does, the glint only lasts for a second or less. In fact, specular surfaces tend to be the dimmest part of the satellite unless you are at just the right geometry. The biggest contributors to Starlink being bright are the white diffuse phased array antennas on the bottom of the satellite, the white diffuse parabolic antennas on the sides (not shown below), and the white diffuse back side of the solar array. These surfaces are all white to keep temperatures down so components do not overheat. The key to making Starlink darker is to prevent sunlight from illuminating these white surfaces and scattering via reflection toward observers on the ground. While in orbit raise and the parking orbit the solar array dominates due to the much larger surface area. However, once the satellites are at their operational altitude, the antennas dominate because the bright backside of the solar array is shadowed. Solutions In-Work We've taken an experimental and iterative approach to reducing the brightness of the Starlink satellites. Orbital brightness is an extremely difficult problem to tackle analytically, so we've been hard at work on both ground and on-orbit testing. For example, earlier this year we launched DarkSat, which is an experimental satellite where we darkened the phased array and parabolic antennas designed to tackle on-station brightness. This reduced the brightness of the satellite by about 55%, as was verified by differential optical measurements comparing DarkSat to other nearby Starlink satellites. This is nearly enough of a brightness reduction to make the satellite invisible to the naked eye while on-station. However, black surfaces in space get hot and reflect some light (including in the IR spectrum), so we are moving forward with a sun visor solution instead. This avoids thermal issues due to black paint, and is expected to be darker than DarkSat since it will block all light from reaching the white diffuse antennas. Early Mission (Orbit Raise and Parking Orbit) Roll Maneuver Since the visor is intended to help with brightness while on-station, it does not shade the back of the solar array, which means that it will not prevent orbit raise and parking orbit brightness. For this, we are working on changing the way the satellite flies up from insertion to parking orbit and to station. We're currently testing rolling the satellite so the vector of the Sun is in-plane with the satellite body, i.e. so the satellite is knife-edge to the Sun. This would reduce the light reflected onto Earth by reducing the surface area that receives light. This is possible when orbit raising and parking in the precession orbit because we don't have to constrain the antennas to be nadir facing to provide coverage to internet users. However, there are a couple of nuanced reasons why this is tricky to implement. First, rolling the solar array away from the Sun reduces the amount of power available to the satellite. Second, because the antennas will sometimes be rolled away from the ground, contact time with the satellites will be reduced. Third, the star tracker cameras are located on the sides of the chassis (the only place they can go and have adequate field of view). Rolling knife edge to the Sun can point one star tracker directly at the Earth and the other one directly at the Sun, which would cause the satellite to have degraded attitude knowledge. There will be a small percentage of instances when the satellites cannot roll all the way to true knife edge to the Sun due to one of the aforementioned constraints. This could result in the occasional set of Starlink satellites in the orbit raise of flight that are temporarily visible for one part of an orbit. On-Station Brightness Satellites spend most of their lives on-station, where they will always be in the shark-fin configuration during visible passes. We can adjust the solar array positioning in this configuration to reflect light from its largely specular solar cells away from Earth and to partially hide it behind the chassis. The main remaining goal is to block the phased arrays and antennae from direct view of the sun. The goal is to cover the white phased array antennas and the parabolic antennas on the sides of the satellite. Using our low orbital altitude and flat satellite geometry to our advantage, we designed an RF-transparent deployable visor for the satellite that blocks the light from reaching most of the satellite body and all of the diffuse parts of the main body. This visor lays flat on the chassis during launch and deploys during satellite separation from Falcon 9. The visor prevents light from reflecting off of the diffuse antennas by blocking the light from reaching the antennas altogether. Not only does this approach avoid the thermal impacts from surface darkening the antennas, but it should also have a larger impact on brightness reduction. As previously noted, the first VisorSat prototype will launch in May and we will have these black, specular visors on all satellites by June. The parabolic antennas on the sides of the Starlink satellite also have visor-like coverings that darken them. We have been working with leading astronomical groups in this effort—in particular the American Astronomical Society and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory—to better understand the methods and instruments employed by the astronomy community. With AAS, we have increased our understanding of the community as a whole through regular calls with a working group of astronomers during which we discuss technical details, provide updates, and work on how we can protect astronomical observations moving forward. A post on some of our sessions is here . One particularly useful presentation from a member of this working group is here . While community understanding is critical to this problem, engineering problems are difficult to solve without specifics. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory was repeatedly flagged as the most difficult case to solve, so we've spent the last few months working very closely with a technical team there to do just that. Among other useful thoughts and discussions, the Vera Rubin team has provided a target brightness reduction that we are using to guide our engineering efforts as we iterate on brightness solutions. These technical and community discussions are paired with our existing efforts to make the satellites easier for astronomers to avoid. Starlink trajectories are published through space-track.org and celestrak.com , which many astronomers use in timing their observations to avoid satellite streaks. We've also started publishing predictive data prior to launch at the request of astronomers. These allow observatories to schedule around the satellites in the first few hours of deployment (as satellites de-tumble and enter the network). Vera Rubin has been described as the limiting case for Starlink, due to its enormous aperture and wide field of view. These two characteristics work in concert to produce the perfect storm for satellite observations. Most astronomical systems look at an extremely small section of the sky (less than 1 degree), which makes it exceedingly unlikely that a satellite will cross in front of the imaging system in a given observation. On the other hand, systems with very large fields of view normally aren't extremely sensitive, meaning that, while streaks will occur, they will have a small impact on the overall data collection. This is why we've been working so closely with the team at the Rubin Observatory. In fact, despite its wide field of view, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is sensitive enough to detect a sunlit golf ball as far away as the Moon. So what can we do to mitigate our impact on these edge cases of wide, fast survey telescopes? Minimizing the Impact on Astronomy The huge collecting area of a larger telescopes like Vera C. Rubin Observatory leads to a sensitivity that will render even the darkest satellites visible.They are so sensitive that it won't be possible to build a satellite that will not produce streaks, in a typical long integration. There is much that can be done to reduce the impact of satellite streaks, and that starts with an understanding of how astronomical sensors work. The astronomical community has done a great job of educating us on their imaging techniques. Optical systems use mirrors or lenses to focus light onto an imaging sensor. Most optical astronomy instruments use sensors called charge-coupled-devices (CCDs) as their detectors because astronomical targets, such as distant supernovae and galaxies, are generally dim–at the limit of what can be detected by a sensor. For these applications, the lower noise level of CCDs allows for a higher signal-to-noise ratio for a given image, making it easier to see very faint features in the universe. However, CCDs suffer from a key drawback: when compared to other common sensors, like the CMOS sensor in your cell phone. If you point your cell phone at a bright light, you'll see all the pixels saturate and turn white in the region of the bright source. If you look at the same target with an optical system that uses a CCD sensor, you'll notice that this bright spot extends to create vertical stripes on the image. This difference is due to the way each sensor type reads the values for each pixel. While a CMOS sensor essentially has an amplifier at each pixel that turns the light collected into a digital value, a CCD sensor has a limited number of amplifiers and moves the collected light (in the form of electrons) across the sensor, to be digitized. This mechanism means that a saturated pixel on a CCD tends to wipe out data from an entire column of pixels. This effect, commonly referred to as 'blooming,' is one example of how a very small but bright source of light can impact an astronomical observation. This principle is the core of our mitigation efforts. While it will not be possible to create satellites that are invisible to the most advanced optical equipment on Earth, by reducing the brightness of the satellites, we can make the existing strategies for dealing with similar issues, such as frame-stacking, dramatically more effective. Future Satellites SpaceX is committed to making future satellite designs as dark as possible. The next generation satellite, designed to take advantage of Starship's unique launch capabilities, will be specifically designed to minimize brightness while also increasing the number of consumers that it can serve with high-speed internet access. While SpaceX is the first large constellation manufacturer and operator to address satellite brightness, we won't be the last. As launch costs continue to drop, more constellations will emerge and they too will need to ensure that the optical properties of their satellites don't create problems for observers on the ground. This is why we are working to make this problem easier for everyone to solve in the future. SpaceX and NASA are targeting May 27 for Falcon 9’s launch of Crew Dragon’s second demonstration mission (Demo-2) from historic Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program . NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will be the first two NASA astronauts to fly onboard the Dragon spacecraft as part of the Demo-2 mission to and from the International Space Station, which will return human spaceflight to the United States since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011. Filled with approximately 4,500 pounds of supplies and payloads, Dragon launched aboard a Falcon 9 rocket on March 6, 2020 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The Dragon spacecraft that supported the CRS-20 mission previously supported the CRS-10 mission in February 2017 and the CRS-16 mission in December 2018. Dragon is the only spacecraft currently flying that's capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. The Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Crew Dragon spacecraft that will support Demo-2 are onsite at SpaceX’s facilities in Florida. To mark the return of human spaceflight on American rockets from American soil, NASA has revived their worm logo for Demo-2 . In preparation for Demo-2, SpaceX has completed a number of major milestones for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. In March 2019, SpaceX completed an end-to-end test flight of Crew Dragon without NASA astronauts onboard, making Dragon the first American spacecraft to autonomously dock with the International Space Station and safely return to Earth. In January 2020, SpaceX demonstrated Crew Dragon's in-flight launch escape capability to reliably carry crew to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency on the launch pad or at any point during ascent. SpaceX has completed over 700 tests of the spacecraft's SuperDraco engines, which fired together at full throttle can power Dragon 0.5 miles away from Falcon 9 in 7.5 seconds, accelerating the vehicle more than 400 mph. SpaceX has completed 27 tests of Crew Dragon’s enhanced Mark 3 parachute design, which will provide a safe landing back on Earth for astronauts returning from the Space Station. These tests include 13 successful single parachute drop tests, 12 successful multi-parachute tests, and a successful demonstration of the upgraded parachute system during Crew Dragon’s in-flight abort test .

Save Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu kicked off a U.S. trip in California to talk to billionaire businessman Elon Musk about antisemitism on his social media platform X — while Musk asked him to address his judicial overhaul in Israel. The two also discussed artificial intelligence in a sparsely-attended livestream event Monday. Netanyahu's high-profile visit to the San Francisco Bay Area comes at a time when Musk is facing accusations of tolerating antisemitic messages on his social media platform, while Netanyahu is confronting political opposition at home and abroad. Protesters gathered early Monday outside the Fremont, California factory where Tesla makes its cars. The video livestream kicked off shortly before 9:30 a.m. with Netanyahu and the Tesla CEO. Netanyahu's official X account posted that he is holding a “one on one conversation” with Musk. The number of viewers hovered around 700-800 people. The two kicked off with a joke about deepfakes and quickly launched into a discussion of artificial intelligence as both a blessing and a curse for humanity. Netanyahu said an important question about more advanced AI is: “How do you get the international regime to control this thing?” He said it starts by getting like-minded states to agree to a code of ethics and code of conduct to foster the benefits and “curb the curses” but said there will still be a need to “police the planet” against rogue actors. The freestyle conversation, which included jokes from both men, soon turned to free speech and antisemitism, with Netanyahu telling Musk he hopes that within the confines of the First Amendment he can find a way to clamp down on antisemitism and other forms of hatred on his social media platform. ""I encourage you and urge you to find the balance. It’s a tough one,” Netanyahu said. Musk said that with 100 million to 200 million posts on X in a day, “some of those are gonna be bad.” He then reiterated the platform's policy to not promote or amplify hate speech. Under Musk, the former Twitter changed its rules so that objectionable posts are not usually removed, but instead their visibility is limited so people have to seek it out if they want to see it. Musk calls this “freedom of speech, not freedom of reach.” Musk is facing accusations of tolerating antisemitic messages on his social media platform. The Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil-rights organization, has accused Musk of allowing antisemitism and hate speech to spread on X. Its director, Jonathan Greenblatt, said Musk had “amplified” the messages of neo-Nazis and white supremacists who want to ban the league by engaging with them recently on X. In a Sept. 4 post, Musk claimed that the league was “trying to kill this platform by falsely accusing it & me of being anti-Semitic.” In other posts, he said the league was responsible for a 60% drop in revenue at X. The ADL was among a coalition or groups that urged companies last year to pause their advertising on Twitter after Musk bought the platform. But analysts who track Twitter have argued that Musk’s chaotic changes to the platform — including jettisoning its well-known brand name — have led to a decline in interest from advertisers. The group met this month with X's chief executive, Linda Yaccarino. Both Musk and Yaccarino have recently posted messages saying they oppose antisemitism. On Sunday, though, Musk posted that George Soros’ organization “appears to want nothing less than the destruction of western civilization.” Soros, 93, has donated billions of dollars of his personal wealth to liberal and anti-authoritarian causes around the world, making him a favored target among many on the right. The Hungarian-American, who is Jewish, has also been the subject of anti-Semitic attacks and conspiracy theories for decades. Netanyahu’s visit was unusually Musk-centric for a world leader. Silicon Valley itineraries for visiting political dignitaries typically also include major tech companies such as Apple, Google or Meta. From California, Netanyahu heads to New York, where he is scheduled to address the United Nations General Assembly and meet with President Joe Biden and other world leaders, his office said. They include German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis have taken part in nine months of demonstrations against Netanyahu’s plan to overhaul Israel’s judicial system. Those protests have spread overseas, with groups of Israeli expats staging demonstrations during visits by Netanyahu and other members of his Cabinet. Netanyahu says the judicial overhaul plan is needed to curb the powers of unelected judges, whom he and his allies say are liberal and overly interventionist. Critics say his plan is a power grab that will destroy the country’s system of checks and balances and push it toward autocratic rule. Leading figures in Israel’s influential high-tech community have played a prominent role in the protests. They say weakening the judiciary will hurt the country’s business climate and drive away foreign investment. Israel’s currency, the shekel, has plunged in value this year in a sign of weakening foreign investment. Netanyahu played down his overhaul as a needed, minor correction to curb what he described as excessive powers of his country’s judiciary. Critics say the plan, which includes a proposal for controlling the appointment of the nation’s judges, would concentrate power in the hands of Netanyahu and his allies. Netanyahu also made no mention of his corruption trial. Netanyahu describes himself as a victim of a witch hunt and his critics say the overhaul is motivated by his anger at the legal system."

NY Digital Editor 
Elon Musk may flip the switch to make X — the social network formerly known as Twitter — an entirely subscription-based platform. 
	Musk brought up the idea of charging all users of X/Twitter during a wide-ranging conversation focused on AI that featured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday. “We’re moving to having a small monthly payment for use of the X system,” Musk told Netanyahu, claiming that “it’s the only way I can think of to combat vast armies of bots.” His comments were initially reported by Bloomberg’s Dave Lee. 
	Musk didn’t mention timing of his plan to charge X/Twitter users, nor did he say exactly how much it would cost other than to say a monthly fee of “a few dollars or something” would deter the creation of bot accounts. According to Musk, X has 550 million monthly active users, who share 100 million-200 million posts daily on the social network. 	        	Musk has previously mulled the idea of putting Twitter entirely behind a paywall in internal conversations, according to industry news site Platformer. Musk, who also is CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has said X/Twitter ad sales have plunged 50% since he bought the company. “We’re still negative cash flow, due to ~50% drop in advertising revenue plus heavy debt load,” Musk posted on July 15.  
	Currently, X’s subscription program — formerly Twitter Blue, now called X Blue, under Musk’s rebranding effort — is priced starting at $8 per month. 
	One of the chief perks of X Blue is getting verified check-mark status, although this summer the company added the ability for subscribers to hide the check-mark from public view. 
	X Blue’s other benefits include the ability to edit a post within a one-hour window; a 50% reduction in ads; “prioritized rankings” of a user’s posts in conversations and search; the ability to post up to 25,000 characters (vs. the 280-character limit); and the ability to upload videos up to 3 hours long or up to 8 gigabytes in size. Blue subscribers also are eligible to receive a share of advertising revenue, initially based on ads displayed in replies to their posts. 
	In October 2022, After Musk begrudgingly closed the debt-laden $44 billion deal for Twitter, he fired Twitter’s senior management team — and installed himself as CEO. Musk then oversaw mass layoffs at Twitter, cutting an estimated 80% of the company’s workforce.  
	Earlier this year, Musk hired ex-NBCUniversal sales boss Linda Yaccarino as CEO. Since joining the company in June, she has hired a group of new sales execs. But Musk ultimately remains in control of X/Twitter (e.g., in July he renamed the company after his favorite letter of the alphabet) and has said he will continue to run the company’s product and technology teams.

The billionaire isn't the only one who's been frightened into holding back help for Ukraine. ... One evening ...","The billionaire isn’t the only one who’s been frightened into holding back help for Ukraine. One evening in September 2022, a group of Ukrainian sea drones sped out into the Black Sea, heading for Russian-occupied Crimea. Their designers—engineers who had been doing other things until the current war began—had carefully targeted the fast, remote-controlled, explosive-packed vessels to hit ships anchored in Sebastopol, the home of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. But the drones ran into a problem: Starlink, the satellite-communications system that Ukraine had been using since Russia invaded early last year, unexpectedly wasn’t working. This was a surprise to the engineers. Several people, in Ukraine and elsewhere, frantically called and texted Elon Musk, the owner of Starlink, to persuade him to enable the system. Musk, in turn, called Walter Isaacson, his biographer, and told him there was a “non-trivial possibility” that the sea-drone attack could lead to a nuclear war. According to Isaacson, Musk had recently spoken with Russia’s ambassador in Washington, who had warned him explicitly that any attack on Crimea would lead to nuclear conflict. Musk implied to several other people (though he later denied it) that he had been speaking with President Vladimir Putin around that time as well. Read: Demon mode activated These are details that you may have already heard. Many of them were first reported in May, by Oliver Carroll at The Economist. Since then, The New Yorker has also described how Ukrainian soldiers abruptly lost their access to Starlink on the battlefield during a different set of land operations. Isaacson’s version of the maritime story implies that all of the drones in the operation washed ashore that evening. But recently in Ukraine, I met some of the engineers who helped design the unmanned sea vehicles, including an engineer who was involved in the first attempt to hit Russian ships in Sebastopol. They told me that not all of the drones involved were lost. Some returned back to base, undamaged. Here is the part you might not have heard, or not registered: The same team launched a similar attack again a few weeks later. On October 29, a fleet of guided sea drones packed with explosives did reach Sebastopol harbor, using a different communications system. They did hit their targets. They put one Russian frigate, the Admiral Makarov, out of commission. The team believes that they damaged at least one submarine and at least two other boats as well. And then? Nuclear war did not follow. Despite Musk’s fears, in other words—fears put into his head by the Russian ambassador, or perhaps by Putin himself—World War III did not erupt as a result of this successful attack on a Crimean port. Instead, the Russian naval commanders were spooked by the attack, so much so that they stuck close to Sebastopol harbor over the following weeks. For their own security, I am choosing not to publish the names of the engineers. I was introduced to them by a tech executive I met on a previous trip to Ukraine, when I was writing about drone operations more broadly. This team has shown off its unmanned boats before, so I am not revealing secrets when I write that they are small, black, and hard to see on the water, and have a very long range—now more than 650 miles, the engineers told me. The drones are constantly reinvented and redesigned. Some of those I saw were described as the “fifth generation.” I was given remote control of one on a distant body of water; directing it felt remarkably like playing a video game. Like the more famous air drones, sea drones are a central important part of Ukraine’s idiosyncratic way of waging war. Unable to compete plane for plane or ship for ship against the much larger Russian military, Ukraine is using tiny, high-tech, custom-designed, and relatively cheap devices that can take large, expensive artillery, tanks, and ships out of the game. Many of these devices are built by groups that are not quite part of the military, but not exactly private either. This networked, grassroots, asymmetric response is part of how the Ukrainians hope to win the war. “This is Ukraine. We are hybrid,” one of the engineers told me. He also told me that although his drones didn’t destroy the whole Black Sea fleet, they have had an impact on the war. Russian military ships became more cautious. Instead of physically blocking Ukrainian grain transports, as some observers expected them to do, they have stayed in port. “We made them scared,” he told me. They were happy to confirm that if a Russian warship does try to block a cargo ship carrying Ukrainian grain, they will hit it. Musk was wrong, in other words. Instead of inspiring World War III, the sea-drone attack helped reduce violence, protected commerce, boosted Ukrainian farmers, and maybe even ensured that some people outside Ukraine didn’t go hungry. If not for Musk’s hubris, those effects might have been felt earlier. Maybe the first attack could have eliminated more of the ships whose missiles have been killing civilians in Ukrainian cities. Maybe fewer people would have died as a result. And maybe the war, which will be over when Ukraine takes back its own territory, and ends the torment of its own citizens on that territory, would be closer to its end. This is a cautionary tale about the arrogance of a billionaire who has come to play a mercurial role in U.S. foreign policy. But it’s also a story about fear, seeded and promoted by the Russians, deliberately designed to shape broader Western perceptions of this war. Musk is not alone: Many people in Washington, and in Berlin, Brussels, and other European capitals, including people who support Ukrainian sovereignty and who want Ukraine to win the war, have also been cowed by conversations with Russian ambassadors, by threats issued by Russian leaders, and by the pictures of nuclear explosions shown on Russian state television. Long before he spoke with any real Russians, Musk likely encountered that same propaganda in the Russian-influenced far-right echo chambers that he frequents. In 2016, Donald Trump probably got the idea to accuse Hillary Clinton of wanting to start World War III in that same social-media milieu. The Russians do this for a reason: Fear of escalation is designed to create self-deterrence—and it works. In 2014, Western leaders, fearing escalation, advised Ukraine not to fight back when Russia invaded Crimea. This advice led to misery for the people arrested, imprisoned, and chased away from the peninsula. It also persuaded the Russians to continue their invasion of eastern Ukraine. They stopped only when the Ukrainians fought back. From 2014 to 2022, the United States and European nations, fearing they might provoke Russia attack, limited or banned weapons sales to Ukraine. This, too, proved to be a terrible, consequential mistake: Had the Russians actually been afraid of the Ukrainian army, they might never have launched the full-scale invasion at all. Read: The war on Ukraine is testing the myth of Elon Musk Even when the full-scale invasion began last year, amorphous fear of Russian reaction again persuaded Americans and Europeans to hold back on long-range weapons to Ukraine, partly because we feared what could happen if they were used to hit Russian targets. But then the Ukrainians used their own weapons to hit Russian targets, first in the border region, then in Moscow, Pskov, and other cities. Nuclear war did not break out then either. I could repeat the same story for just about every significant class of weapons. Fear of escalation meant that some nations, notably Germany and the United States, did not give Ukraine the tanks that it needed to go on the offensive and take back its territory. Fear of escalation also meant that Ukrainians did not receive F-16s in time to help with this summer’s counteroffensive. Fear of escalation meant that we have refused to give the Ukrainians a long-range ballistic-missile system known as ATACMS. Now the tanks are on the ground, the F-16 pilot training has begun, and the Biden administration reportedly may be planning to give Ukraine ATACMS. Each of the delays wasted time. And time has cost lives—maybe tens of thousands of lives. I was in Ukraine exactly a year ago, on the weekend that Ukrainian troops took back the northern cities of Izyum and Kupiansk. A few weeks later, the Ukrainians took back the city of Kherson. At the time, they had momentum. A year later, the euphoria is gone, and no wonder: That momentum was lost. After taking Kherson, Ukrainian forces did not have the weaponry to move farther forward. They did not try to advance again until June of this year. By that time, Russians had created hundreds of kilometers of minefields, some of the most extensive minefields any army has ever tried to cross, as well as a system of tank traps and trenches that has slowed Ukraine’s counteroffensive and, again, led to the deaths of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians. Think about what the world might look like if Putin’s nuclear threats had not influenced our imaginations so profoundly. If Musk had not been spooked by Russian propaganda, then some of Russia’s fleet might have been disabled a month earlier. If Washington, London, Paris, and Berlin had not been spooked by Russian propaganda, then the Ukrainians might have expelled the Russians earlier, and the war might be over. Death, horror, and terror have been the result every time outsiders hesitated to aid Ukraine. There is always a “non-trivial possibility,” to borrow Musk’s term, that the Russians will use nuclear weapons; there was also a nonzero possibility that Robert Oppenheimer’s nuclear-bomb test would blow up the planet. But if we want to deter the Russians from using their nuclear weapons, we have other ways to do it. Our own nuclear weapons, and our own superior conventional forces, are powerful deterrents: Most analysts think they explain why Russia has not deliberately hit any targets on NATO territory. Heavy hints from China and India that nuclear escalation would be a terrible mistake, as well as statements about the unacceptability of nuclear war from the G20, the United Nations, and others help, too. Ukrainian attacks—especially unexpected, asymmetric attacks, like those from sea drones—are also a form of deterrence. So is our continued commitment to Ukraine. Every time we announce another weapons shipment, or the European Union makes another financial pledge, or President Joe Biden makes another statement of support, then the Russians know that the price of occupation, and of any escalation, is growing higher. Resistance doesn’t provoke Putin; weakness does."

A new biography from the journalist Walter Isaacson is the first to disclose that Elon Musk and Grimes have a third child named Techno ...","Jump to        A new biography of Elon Musk said the Tesla CEO had a previously unreported third child with the Canadian musician Grimes, his ex-partner. The couple deliberately kept the child's existence private, the book says. The child, who was born in mid-June 2022 — during the week of Father's Day — is named Techno Mechanicus. He goes by the nickname Tau, after the Greek letter for the number equal to two times pi, which is roughly 6.28. This, in turn, reflects Musk's own birthday — June 28. The journalist Walter Isaacson was given unprecedented access to Musk over the last two years. Techno's birth was first revealed in a New York Times review of the biography, which is simply titled ""Elon Musk."" Accounting for Techno Mechanicus, Musk now has 10 known living children with three different women. Musk and Grimes, born Claire Boucher, first announced their relationship in May 2018. Since then, the couple announced the birth of two children. Their first was born in 2020 and named X Æ A-Xii, or X. The couple revealed news of his little sister, Exa Dark Sideræl Musk, who goes by Y, in March 2022.  Musk and Grimes have since split, but the musician has previously said their relationship is ""fluid."" ""Tau is so amazing,"" Grimes told Isaacson. ""He came out with eyes that could just see so deeply into your soul, with so much knowledge. He looks like a little Spock. He's definitely a Vulcan."" Isaacson interviewed Musk's former wives, Justine Musk and Talulah Riley, for the book. He also interviewed Shivon Zilis, the Neuralink manager with whom Musk had two children. Isaacson's biography has also garnered attention for the scoop that the SpaceX CEO interfered with a Ukrainian offensive attack in Crimea by disabling nearby Starlink coverage. Musk later tweeted that he never turned the satellites off, saying instead that the satellites were never on and that he refused to activate them. Musk said he feared the planned attack would trigger a nuclear response from Russia.

NPR's A Martinez speaks with Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt about Israel's prime minister meeting with Elon Musk to talk ...","A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be in California today meeting with tech leaders before heading to New York City for the United Nations General Assembly. Among those tech leaders is Elon Musk, whose social media platform, X, or Twitter, has been flooded with antisemitic hate in recent weeks, some of it amplified by Musk in his own tweets. The target of many of those messages, it's the Anti-Defamation League, a group that describes its focus as fighting antisemitism and all forms of hate. Jonathan Greenblatt is CEO and national director of the Anti-Defamation League. We have him here on the line. Jonathan, so what do you make of the Netanyahu-Musk meeting? JONATHAN GREENBLATT: Well, look; I'm aware that Prime Minister Netanyahu and Elon Musk are meeting in San Francisco today. Nothing about the meeting is particularly surprising given Musk's range of business interests like Starlink and SpaceX and Israel's technology sector, which is one of the most innovative and dynamic in the world. But as you said in the opening, Israel and Jews frequently are targets of hateful anti-Zionist and antisemitic invective on Twitter/X. So what I would hope is that they may have a productive meeting about a range of issues, but they will talk about concrete strategies to combat the rampant antisemitism and the grotesque anti-Zionism that dominates the platform. MARTÍNEZ: Now, we should stipulate that the Anti-Defamation League has been critical of Netanyahu and his government policies. What do you think, though, Jonathan, are the chances that Netanyahu would use his leverage in this meeting today? GREENBLATT: Well, I would hope that Prime Minister Netanyahu would use his leverage. Look; Israel's the homeland of the Jewish people, regardless of how they vote or what they value or even where they live. And so it's imperative for the prime minister to recognize that what Elon Musk has done - and his platform, even before Elon bought it - is to normalize the kind of ugly antisemitism that we used to associate with Cossacks and Nazis and white supremacists. Now you can see it 24/7 with just a click on X. MARTÍNEZ: What do you think Musk's reaction would be if Netanyahu, indeed, tried to use his leverage? Do you think he'd get anywhere? GREENBLATT: Look. I hope the prime minister will bring the receipts. It's not hard to see if you open up the platform and just look at the hashtag that was exploding in the last few weeks, #BanTheADL. This was a hashtag that was started by a range of antisemites and white supremacists and QAnon types after I met with Linda Yaccarino, Elon's CEO, two weeks ago. And you can see hundreds of thousands of mentions, A, with all kinds of ugly invective, the type of thing you wouldn't want your children to see. And yet, again, it's available with a click on X. So I hope the prime minister will push Elon to say concretely what he will do to take the hate off the platform. MARTÍNEZ: And I think you and your organization are in a weird spot because you try to combat antisemitism on a social media site where the site's owner allows it to happen. So where does that leave you? GREENBLATT: Yeah. It's a strange situation, indeed, where the owner is sort of a protagonist in this drama. But look; ADL works with all the tech companies from Alphabet to Zoom, all of them, because again, we want to make it - we want to be constructive, and we want to help them get it better. But clearly, Twitter is not trending in the right direction. There's real work to be done to detoxify it, if you will, and we hope that'll start with this meeting. MARTÍNEZ: Jonathan Greenblatt is national director of the Anti-Defamation League. Jonathan, thanks. GREENBLATT: Thanks for having me. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

However, I don’t agree that Musk has made a mistake and he should hang up his figurative spurs and hat. Only time will truly tell that story. If he’s made a mistake, he couldn’t have picked a better company and place to make it happen. Twitter was becoming too much of a social police person and Texas, well, that’s a pretty unique place. Its economy is larger than Canada’s. Its the only state in the union that can acseed without asking for permission. In short, Texas has a lot of bragging rights and so does Musk.

Elon Musk and Grimes have secretly welcomed their third child into the world, a new biography of the business mogul has revealed.","Get local news delivered to your inbox! Elon Musk and Grimes have secretly welcomed their third child into the world. The on/off couple were known to be parents to three-year-old son X Æ A-12, and daughter Exa Dark Sideræl, 19 months, but a new biography of the Tesla boss - who has fathered eight other children with two women - by journalist Walter Isaacson states they have also had another son, who is officially named Techo Mechanicus but goes by the name of Tau. The revelation is mentioned in an extensive review of the book, which is simply titled 'Elon Musk', by the New York Times newspaper. The outlet wrote: "" Isaacson has ably conveyed that Musk doesn't truly like pushback. Some of his lieutenants insist that he will eventually listen to reason, but Isaacson sees firsthand Musk's habit of deriding as a saboteur or an idiot anyone who resists him. ""The musician Grimes, the mother of three of Musk's children (the existence of the third, Techno Mechanicus, nicknamed Tau, has been kept private until now), calls his roiling anger ""demon mode"" -- a mind-set that ""causes a lot of chaos."" She also insists that it allows him to get stuff done. It is unclear if the book contains any more information about the child, including when or where he was born, and representatives for the 52-year-old billionaire and the 'Genesis' singer have yet to comment. Grimes - whose real name is Claire Boucher - recently revealed her older children, who are known as X and Y respectively, share their father's interests in space and engineering. Speaking to Wired before the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike, the 35-year-old star said: ""X knows a lot about rockets. It's crazy. He knows more about rockets than me. ""We had to stop giving him toys, because if they're not anatomically correct, he gets upset. ""He's a little engineer, for sure. But his obsession with space is bordering on, 'Is this healthy?'

 Canadisk  
Elon Reeve Musk (/ˈiːlɒn ˈmʌsk/; født den 28. juni 1971 i Pretoria i Sydafrika) er en sydafrikanskfødt canadisk-amerikansk forretningsmand, ingeniør og opfinder.[4][5][6][7] Han har i tidens løb været stifter, direktør og (med-)ejer af en række store, ofte højteknologiske virksomheder som Tesla, Inc, SpaceX, solenergifirmaet SolarCity, infrastruktur- og tunnelboringsfirmaet The Boring Company, Zip2, PayPal og Neuralink.[8][9][10] I april 2022 blev det ligeledes annonceret, at han ville købe det sociale medie Twitter i en handel til en værdi af $44 milliarder.[11] 
I henhold til Bloomberg blev Musk for første gang officielt verdens rigeste personer i begyndelsen af 2021, hvor han overhalede Jeff Bezos, stifter af Amazon.com, Inc., på Bloomberg Billionaires Index med en personlig formue på i alt $186 milliarder ($1,5 milliarder mere end Bezos).[12] I september 2021 var han ifølge erhvervsmagasinet Forbes blandt kun tre personer nogensinde, der har opnået en formue på mere end $200 mia. – de andre to var Jeff Bezos og franskmanden Bernard Arnault, direktør for luksusvarevirksomheden Louis Vuitton.[13] I henhold til Forbes havde hans formue ved udgangen af 2021 oversteget $300 mia., hvilket gjorde ham til den første person nogensinde med en formue på over $300 mia.[14] 
Musk blev født den 28. juni 1971 i Pretoria, Gauteng, Sydafrika,[15] som søn af Maye (født Haldeman), en model og diætist fra Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada,[16] og Errol Musk, en sydafrikansk elektroingeniør og pilot. Han har en lillebror, som hedder Kimbal (født 1972), og en lillesøster, som hedder Tosca (født 1974).[16][17][18][19] Hans farmor var britisk og af Pennsylvania Dutch-herkomst.[20][21] Efter at hans forældre blev skilt i 1980, boede Musk oftest med sin far i Pretorias forstæder.[20]  Gennem barndommen var han en ihærdig læser. Da han var 10 år, blev han interesseret i computere og arbejdede på en Commodore VIC-20.[22] Han lærte sig selv computerprogrammering, og da han var 12 år gammel, solgte han kildeteksten til et BASIC-baseret videospil, Blastar, til bladet PC and Office Technology for omkring 500 amerikanske dollar.[23][24] En browserbaseret version af spillet er tilgængelig online.[23] Musk gik på den engelsktalende privatskole Waterkloof House Preparatory School og dimitterede senere fra Pretoria Boys High School. Musk flyttede til Canada i juni 1989, lige før sin 18 års fødselsdag, efter at han havde fået canadisk statsborgerskab på grund af sin canadiskfødte mor. 
I en alder af 19 år blev Musk optaget på Queen's University i Kingston, Ontario. To år senere, i 1992, skiftede han til University of Pennsylvania, hvor han i en alder af 24 år blev bachelor i fysik ved Penn's College of Arts and Sciences og bachelor i økonomi ved Wharton School. Mens han var ved University of Pennsylvania, købte Musk og en anden studerende, Adeo Ressi, en 10-værelses studenterforening og brugte det som en uofficiel natklub. I 1995 flyttede Musk 24 år gammel til Californien for at påbegynde en ph.d. i anvendt fysik ved Stanford University, men forlod studiet efter to dage for at forfølge sin iværksættertrang[kilde mangler] indenfor områder som internettet, vedvarende energi og det ydre rum. I 2002 blev han amerikansk statsborger. 
I 1995 startede Musk og hans bror, Kimbal, Zip2, et webbaseret softwarefirma, med hjælp af 28,000 USD fra deres far, Errol Musk. Firmaet udviklede og markedsførte en ""byguide"" til forlagsindustrien. Musk opnåede kontrakter med The New York Times og Chicago Tribune og overtalte bestyrelsen i Zip2 til at opgive planerne om en fusion med et firma kaldet CitySearch. Musk ønskede at blive administrerende direktør for Zip2, men bestyrelsen ville ikke tillade det. I februar 1999 erhvervede Compaq Zip2 for 307 millioner amerikanske dollars i kontanter og 34 millioner dollars i aktieoptioner.[26] Musk fik 22 millioner dollars, svarende til 7 %, fra salget. 
I marts 1999 var Musk medstifter af X.com, et netbaseret finansielt service- og e-mailbetalingsselskab, med 10 millioner USD fra salget af Zip2. Et år senere fusionerede selskabet med Confinity,[27] som havde en betalingstjeneste kaldet PayPal. Det fusionerede firma fokuserede på PayPal-tjenesten og blev omdøbt til PayPal i 2001. PayPals tidlige vækst var hovedsageligt drevet af en stor marketingkampagne, hvor nye kunder blev hvervet, når de modtog penge gennem tjenesten.[28] Musk blev senere afsat fra sin rolle som administrerende direktør på grund af uenigheder om PayPals fremtidige arkitektur, som skulle bygge på Microsoft Windows.[kilde mangler][29] I oktober 2002 blev PayPal købt af eBay for 1,5 milliarder USD i aktier, af hvilke Musk fik 165 millioner USD.[30] Før salget ejede Musk, som firmaets største aktionær, 11,7% af PayPals aktier. 
I 2001 udviklede Musk rumprojektet ""Mars Oasis"", med det formål at sende et lille eksperimentelt drivhus til Mars. Drivhuset skulle være forberedt, så planter ville påbegynde spiringen efter landingen. De grønne vækster, som nu ville vokse og dø på en fremmed planet, skulle vække offentlighedens slumrende interesse for bemandet rumforskning. I oktober 2001 rejste Musk til Moskva med Jim Cantrell og Adeo Ressi (hans bedste ven fra college) for at købe ombyggede krydsermissiler (Dnepr-1) der kunne sende drivhuset i rummet. Gruppen mødtes med firmaer såsom NPO Lavochkin og Kosmotras, men Musk blev, ifølge Cantrell, betragtet som en nybegynder, og blev endda spyttet på[kilde mangler] af en af de russiske ledende designere, og gruppen vendte tilbage til USA med tomme hænder. I februar 2002 vendte gruppen tilbage til Rusland for at finde tre missiler. Gruppen mødtes igen med Kosmotras og fik tilbudt en raket for US$8 millioner. Det syntes Musk dog var for dyrt. På flyturen hjem fra Moskva besluttede Musk at starte en virksomhed der kunne bygge billige raketter. 
Med $100 millioner af sin egen formue[31] startede Musk Space Exploration Technologies, eller SpaceX, i juni 2002.[32] Musk er administrerende direktør og teknisk direktør (CTO) for firmaet, som er baseret i Californien. SpaceX udvikler og konstruerer løftefartøjer til brug i rummet, med fokus på at hæve raketteknologiens niveau. Firmaets to første løftefartøjer er Falcon 1- og Falcon 9-raketterne (en hilsen til Star Wars' Millennium Falcon[kilde mangler]), og dets første rumskib er Dragon (en hilsen til sangen Puff, the Magic Dragon). I de næste syv år designede SpaceX de kommende Falcon-løftefartøjer og Dragon MP-rumskibe, og i september 2009 blev SpaceX's Falcon 1-raket det første privatfinansierede fartøj med flydende brændstof, der placerede en satellit i kredsløb om Jorden.[33] 
Musks mål er at reducere prisen på bemandet rumrejse med en faktor 10.[34] I et interview i 2011 sagde han, at han håbede på at sende mennesker til Mars' overflade ti til tyve år ude i fremtiden. I Ashlee Vance's biografi om Musk afslører Musk, at han ønsker en koloni på Mars i 2040 med en befolkning på 80.000. 
Tesla Motors blev grundlagt i juli 2003 af Martin Eberhard og Marc Tarpenning, som finansierede firmaet i starten. Begge mænd spillede aktive roller i firmaets tidlige udvikling, inden Elon Musk blev involveret. [35]  Efter finanskrisen i 2008[36] overtog Musk ledelsen af virksomheden som administrerende direktør og ansvarlig for produktudviklingen, stillinger som han stadig har i dag. Tesla Motors byggede først en elektrisk sportsvogn, Tesla Roadster, som solgtes i 2,500 eksemplarer i 31 lande. Tesla begyndte levering af deres firedørs sedan Model S den 22. juni 2012. Firmaet offentliggjorde deres tredje produkt, Model X, rettet mod SUV/MPV-markedet, den 9. februar 2012. Model X blev dog først lanceret i september 2015.[37][38][39] Udover deres egne biler sælger Tesla også elektriske drivlinjesystemer til Daimler til deres Smart EV, Mercedes B-Class Electric Drive og Mercedes A Class, og til Toyotas RAV4 EV. Musk betragter en demonstration af en samlerobot ved genåbningen af NUMMI-fabrikken, nu kaldet Tesla Factory (Fremont, Californien) i 2010

Musk fastsatte den oprindelige ide og skaffede den finansielle kapital til SolarCity, som derefter blev stiftet i 2006 af hans fætre Lyndon og Peter Rive. Musk er stadigvæk den største aktionær. I 2013 var SolarCity den næststørste udbyder af solcelleanlæg i USA.[40] 
Tesla købte SolarCity for mere end 2 mia. dollar i 2016 og fusionerede selskabet med sin batteriafdeling i den nye virksomhed Tesla Energy. Nyheden medførte et fald i Teslas aktiekurs på 10 %. Senere viste det sig, at SolarCity havde likviditetsproblemer på tidspunktet for handelen, som Teslas aktionærer ikke var blevet informeret om. Sagen førte til en retssag mod Musk og Teslas ledelse.[41][42] 
I december 2015 annoncerede Elon Musk oprettelsen af OpenAI, en almennyttig virksomhed, der forsker i kunstig intelligens. Ved at gøre kunstig intelligens tilgængelig for alle ønsker OpenAI at ""sikre, at virksomheder og regeringer ikke får for meget magt ved anvendelsen af avanceret kunstig intelligens"".[43] 
The Boring Company blev grundlagt af Elon Musk i 2016. Han annoncerede det nye selskab på Twitter med begrundelsen, at han ""var ved at blive vanvittig af trafikken i Los Angeles.""[44] Virksomhedens formål er at grave tunneller til et hyperloop-projekt, dvs. et netværk af højhastighedstunneller til persontransport.[45] 
Musk er fortaler for højhastighedstransportsystemet Hyperloop og har foreslået et elektrisk overlyds-jetfly, som kan lette og lande lodret.[46][47] 
Politisk set beskriver Musk sig selv som ""half Democrat, half Republican"". Ifølge ham selv er han ""et sted i midten, socialt venstreorienteret og økonomisk konservativ"" (""somewhere in the middle, socially liberal and fiscally conservative"").[48] 
I et interview med Washington Post udmeldte Musk, at han var en ""væsentlig (men ikke topklasse) donor til Demokraterne, men at han også giver meget til Republikanerne"". Musk fortsatte: ""for at ens stemme kan vil blive hørt i Washington, bliver man nødt til at give nogle små bidrag.""[49]  Da han blev spurgt om han tror på at ""der er en form for skæbne involveret"" i menneskehedens overgang til en multi-planetarisk art, ud over ""bare fysik"", svarede Musk: Well, I do. Do I think that there's some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff? I think probably not because then you have to say: ""Where does the master intelligence come from?"" So it sort of begs the question. So I think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics. You know its complex phenomenon from simple elements.[50] Musk har ejet en McLaren F1-superbil, som han kørte galt i og totalskadede, inden han havde fået den forsikret.[51] Han har tidligere ejet et tjekkisk fremstillet jettrænefly Aero L-39.[52]

Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn ˈmʌsk/; lahir 28 Juni 1971) adalah pengusaha, penemu, dan tokoh bisnis dari Amerika Serikat. Ia merupakan pendiri, CTO, dan CEO SpaceX;[11] CEO dan arsitek produksi Tesla, Inc.; pendiri The Boring Company; dan juga pendiri Neuralink dan OpenAI. Dengan pendapatan yang diperkirakan sekitar US$240 miliar sampai April 2022,[12] Musk adalah orang terkaya di dunia menurut baik Bloomberg Biilionaires Index dan Forbes.[13][14] 
Setelah mengikuti kuliah perdagangan di Queen's School of Business selama dua tahun, Musk mendapatkan gelar sarjana ekonomi dari the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania[15] dan sarjana fisika.[15] Musk Melanjutkan Studi Ph.D. Fisika ke Universitas Stanford pada tahun 1995 namun hanya mengikuti kelas selama 2 hari untuk melanjutkan karirnya dengan mendirikan Zip2, Musk juga ikut berperan dalam berdirinya PayPal.[16][17] Musk memiliki tiga kewarganegaraan yaitu Afrika Selatan, Kanada, dan Amerika Serikat. 
Musk adalah pendiri beberapa perusahaan teknologi populer, termasuk SpaceX yang bergerak di teknologi antariksa; Tesla Inc. yang bergerak di bidang otomotif; OpenAI, SolarCity, Neuralink, serta beberapa perusahaan lainnya. Musk menyatakan bahwa dengan perusahaan-perusahaan ini didirikannya dengan tujuan mengubah dunia dan kehidupan manusia termasuk mengurangi pemanasan global melalui peningkatan produksi dan konsumsi energi terbarukan. Ia juga berharap dapat mengurangi ""risiko punahnya umat manusia"" dengan meningkatkan teknologi untuk hidup di planet lain, khususnya di Mars. 
Elon lahir di Pretoria, Afrika Selatan, dari pasangan ibu Kanada dan ayah Afrika Selatan.[18][19][20] Ibunya bernama Maye Musk, seorang model dari Regina, Saskatchewan, Kanada, sementara ayahnya adalah Errol Musk, seorang ahli elektromekanika, pilot, dan juga pelaut. 
Ia memiliki seorang adik laki-laki bernama Kimbal (lahir pada 1972) dan adik perempuan, Tosca (lahir 1974). Neneknya berasal dari Britania Raya, sementara kakeknya berasal dari Amerika Serikat. Setelah orang tuanya bercerai pada tahun 1980, Elon tinggal bersama ayahnya di Pretoria. 
Sejak kecil, Elon sangat senang membaca dan belajar. Pada usia 10 tahun, ia mulai tertarik dengan mempelajari teknik komputer. Pada usia 12 tahun, ia belajar pemrograman dan berhasil membuat serta menjual kode komputer pada majalah komputer untuk sebuah gim yang ia beri nama Blastar dengan harga $500.[21] 
Elon lulus dari Pretoria Boys High School dan pindah ke Kanada tahun 1989 pada usia 17 tahun untuk menghindari wajib militer di Afrika Selatan.[21][22] Tahun 1992, setelah belajar selama dua tahun di Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Musk pindah ke Wharton School di University of Pennsylvania[15] dan memperoleh gelar S1 dalam bidang ekonomi[15] dan S1 kedua dalam bidang fisika.[16] Ia pindah ke California untuk mengejar gelar Ph.D. dalam bidang fisika terapan di Stanford namun keluar setelah dua hari demi mengejar keinginannya untuk berwiraswasta di sektor Internet, energi terbarukan, dan luar angkasa.[21][23] 
Pada 1995, Musk, adiknya Kimbal, dan Greg Kouri mendirikan Zip2, sebuah perusahaan perangkat lunak web, dengan dana dari pemodal mulia.[24] Mereka mendirikan perusahaan tersebut di sebuah kantor sewaan kecil di Palo Alto.[25] Perusahaan ini mengembangkan dan memasarkan sebuah ""panduan kota"" Internet untuk industri penerbitan surat kabar, dengan peta, penunjuk arah dan halaman kuning.[16] Musk mengatakan bahwa sebelum perusahaannya sukses, karena ia tidak dapat membeli apartemen, ia menyewa sebuah kantor dan tidur di sofa dan mandi di YMCA. Ia juga menggunakan komputer bersama dengan adiknya.[25] Ketika ia berbeda pendapat dengan adiknya tentang keputusan bisnis, mereka menyelesaikannya dengan bergulat.[26] Menurut Musk, ""Situsnya berjalan di pagi hari dan saya menulis kodenya di malam hari, tujuh hari seminggu, setiap waktu"".[25] Musk bersaudara mendapatkan kontrak dengan New York Times dan Chicago Tribune[27] dan membujuk dewan direkturnya agar mau membatalkan rencana merger dengan perusahaan CitySearch.[17] Compaq mengakuisisi Zip2 senilai US$307 juta secara tunai dan US$34 juta dalam bentuk opsi saham pada tahun 1999,[28] dan Musk menerima 7% atau $22 juta dari penjualan tersebut.[27] 
Musk memanfaatkan hasil penjualan Zip2-nya sebesar $10 juta untuk mendirikan layanan keuangan dalam jaringan bernama X.com pada bulan Maret 1999.[17][27] Musk merekrut eksekutif bisnis John Story dan Bill Harris sebagai investor dan Harris menjadi presiden dan CEO perusahaan.[27] Musk menjadi ketua perusahaan dan menerima modal sebesar $25 juta dari firma modal usaha Sequoia Capital.[27] Perusahaan ini mulai meluncurkan layanannya pada Desember 1999 yang menyediakan rekening dan kartu tunai Internet.[27] 
Beberapa bulan kemudian, X.com mengakuisisi Confinity, perusahaan yang mengoperasikan layanan transfer uang bernama PayPal.[27] Pendiri pendamping Confinity, Max Levchin, dan salah satu investor perusahaan mendepak Musk dari jabatannya sebagai CEO X.com.[17] Sistem PayPal baru berusia beberapa bulan dan Musk merasa PayPal punya masa depan yang menjanjikan.[27] Musk dan Harris kali ini tidak sepakat dan Harris keluar dari perusahaan pada Mei 2000.[27] Bulan Oktober 2000, Musk memutuskan bahwa X.com akan menghentikan operasi perbankan Internetnya dan berfokus pada layanan uang PayPal.[17] X.com berganti nama menjadi PayPal[29] dan berekspansi cepat tahun 2001 karena digunakan oleh eBay. Perusahaan yang baru berganti nama ini membuka diri sebagai perusahaan yang diperdagangkan publik pada Februari 2002 dan diakuisisi eBay senilai $1,5 miliar dalam bentuk saham pada akhir 2002.[17][27] 11,5% saham Musk atas perusahaan terakuisisi ini berbuah $165 juta dalam bentuk saham eBay.[27][30][30][31][32] 
Musk mendirikan perusahaan ketiganya, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), pada bulan Juni 2002[33] dan menjabat sebagai CEO dan CTO. SpaceX mengembangkan dan memproduksi wahana luncur antariksa sambil memajukan teknologi roket. Dua wahana luncur pertama buatan perusahaan ini adalah roket Falcon 1 dan Falcon 9. Wahana antariksa pertamanya adalah Dragon.[34] 
SpaceX memenangkan kontrak NASA senilai $1,6 miliar pada 23 Desember 2008 untuk 12 penerbangan roket Falcon 9 dan wahana antariksa Dragon ke International Space Station, menggantikan program Space Shuttle setelah dihentikan tahun 2011. Awalnya, Falcon 9/Dragon akan menggantikan fungsi angkut kargo Shuttle dan transportasi astronaut akan ditangani Soyuz. Akan tetapi, SpaceX telah merancang Falcon 9/Dragon dengan kemampuan angkut astronaut dan komisi Augustine merekomendasikan agar transportasi astronaut ditangani oleh perusahaan komersial seperti SpaceX.[35] 
Musk[pranala nonaktif permanen] mengaku dipengaruhi oleh seri Foundation Isaac Asimov[36] dan memandang penjelajahan luar angkasa sebagai tahap utama untuk memperluas sekaligus melestarikan kehidupan manusia.[37] Musk mengatakan bahwa kehidupan multiplanet bisa meredam ancaman terhadap kelangsungan spesies manusia. ""Asteroid atau gunung berapi super bisa memusnahkan kita, dan kita menghadapi risiko yang tidak pernah dialami dinosaurus: Virus rekayasa, pembuatan lubang hitam mikro tak disengaja, pemanasan global atau teknologi misterius yang mampu mengakhiri kelangsungan hidup kita. Umat manusia berevolusi selama jutaan tahun, tetapi dalam enam puluh tahun terakhir, senjata atom memunculkan potensi untuk memusnahkan diri kita sendiri. Cepat atau lambat, kita harus memperluas eksistensi manusia sampai ke luar bola hijau dan biru ini—atau siap-siap musnah."" Tujuan Musk adalah mengurangi biaya penerbangan antariksa manusia sampai sepersepuluhnya.[38] Ia mendirikan SpaceX dengan dana $100 juta dari kekayaannya sendiri. Ia masih menjabat sebagai CEO dan CTO perusahaan yang berpusat di Hawthorne, California ini.[39] 
Dalam kurun tujuh tahun, SpaceX merancang keluarga wahana luncur Falcon dan wahana antariksa serbaguna Dragon dari nol. Bulan September 2009, roket SpaceX Falcon 1 menjadi wahana berbahan bakar cair swasta pertama yang menempatkan satelit di orbit Bumi. NASA memilih SpaceX sebagai bagian dari program pertama yang memercayakan perusahaan swasta untuk mengirim kargo ke International Space Station. Kontrak ini, dengan nilai minimal $1,6 miliar dan nilai maksimal $3,1 miliar, menjadi titik balik akses pengiriman kargo ke dan dari stasiun luar angkasa. Selain layanan ini, tujuan SpaceX adalah menurunkan biaya penerbangan luar angkasa orbital dan memperbarui keandalannya menurut urutan kepentingannya, serta menciptakan wahana luncur orbit yang dapat dipakai kembali. Pada tahun-tahun selanjutnya, Musk akan berfokus mengirimkan astronaut ke International Space Station, namun ia juga menyatakan bahwa tujuan pribadinya adalah memungkinkan penjelajahan dan kolonisasi Mars oleh manusia. Dalam wawancara tahun 2011, ia mengungkapkan harapannya agar bisa mengirim manusia ke permukaan Mars dalam kurun 10–20 tahun mendatang.[40]
Tanggal 25 Mei 2012, wahana SpaceX Dragon merapat di ISS dan membuat SpaceX perusahaan komersial pertama yang meluncurkan dan merapatkan wahananya di International Space Station.[41] 
Musk adalah salah satu pendiri Tesla Motors dan saat ini menjabat sebagai kepala desain produk. Meski begitu, ketertarikan Musk terhadap mobil listrik sudah ada jauh sebelum pendirian Tesla. 
Musk memimpin investasi Series A di Tesla Motors yang diinkorporasikan dan didanai 9 bulan sebelumnya oleh Martin Eberhard dan Marc Tarpenning. Putaran Series A melibatkan investasi dari grup-grup investor kecil, termasuk SDL Ventures dan Compass Technology Partners. Akibat krisis keuangan 2008 dan pemutusan hubungan kerja di Tesla,[42] Musk terpaksa mengemban tugas-tugas CEO. 
Tesla Motors awalnya membuat mobil sport listrik, Tesla Roadster, yang berhasil terjual 2.500 unit di 31 negara. Tesla mulai meluncurkan sedan Model S empat pintunya pada 22 Juni 2012 dan Model X untuk pasar SUV/minivan pada 9 Februari 2012. Model X rencananya mulai diproduksi tahun 2014.[43]
Selain mobilnya sendiri, Tesla menjual sistem powertrain listrik ke Daimler untuk mobil Smart EV dan Mercedes A Class dan ke Toyota untuk mobil listrik RAV4. Musk juga berhasil membuat kedua perusahaan tersebut mau menanamkan modal jangka panjang di Tesla. 
Musk juga lebih memilih produksi mobil subkompak di bawah $30.000 dan membuat dan menjual komponen powertrain mobil listrik supaya produsen mobil lainnya bisa memproduksi mobil listrik dengan harga terjangkau tanpa perlu mengembangkan sendiri komponennya.[44] Sejumlah majalah dan surat kabar besar membanding-bandingkan Musk dengan Henry Ford atas usahanya yang mempercanggih powertrain mobil.[45] 
Untuk mengakali hambatan jarak tempuh mobil listrik, dalam sebuah wawancara dengan All Thins D bulan Mei 2013, Musk mengatakan bahwa Tesla sedang ""memperluas secara dramatis"" jaringan stasiun pengisian listriknya (supercharger), melipat tigakan jumlahnya di pesisir timur dan barat Amerika Serikat sepanjang bulan Juni, disertai rencana ekspansi ke seluruh Amerika Utara, termasuk Kanada, sampai akhir tahun ini.[46] Ia kabarnya memegang 17% saham Tesla senilai $227 miliar per Februari 2022.[47] 
Musk adalah pengusung konsep awal SolarCity, perusahaan yang jabatan ketua dewan dan sebagian besar sahamnya dipegang oleh Musk. SolarCity adalah penyalur sistem tenaga surya terbesar di Amerika Serikat. Sepupunya, Lyndon Rive, adalah CEO dan pendiri pendamping perusahaan ini.[48][49] Motivasi yang mendasari pendanaan SolarCity dan Tesla adalah melawan pemanasan global.[50] Pada tahun 2012, Musk mengumumkan bahwa SolarCity dan Tesla Motors bekerja sama memanfaatkan baterai mobil listrik untuk mengurangi dampak panel surya di atap terhadap sistem listrik kota.[51] 
Pada 17 Juni 2014, Musk berkomitmen untuk membangun fasilitas produksi canggih SolarCity di Buffalo, New York, yang akan tiga kali lipat ukuran pabrik surya terbesar di Amerika Serikat. Musk menyatakan pabrik itu akan menjadi ""salah satu pabrik produksi panel surya terbesar di dunia,"" dan akan diikuti oleh satu atau lebih fasilitas yang bahkan lebih besar pada tahun-tahun berikutnya.[52] Tesla Gigafactory 2 adalah pabrik sel fotovoltaik (PV), yang disewa oleh anak perusahaan Tesla, SolarCity di Buffalo, New York. Konstruksi pabrik dimulai pada 2014 dan selesai pada 2017.[53] Tesla menerima $ 750 juta dana publik dari Gubernur New York Andrew Cuomo sebagai bagian dari proyek Buffalo Billion - sebuah rencana untuk menginvestasikan uang untuk membantu perekonomian Buffalo, wilayah New York - untuk membangun pabrik dan infrastruktur.[54] 
Tanggal 12 Agustus 2013, Musk meluncurkan rencana mode transportasi baru yang akan menghubungkan wilayah Los Angeles Raya dan Wilayah Teluk San Francisco setelah dikecewakan oleh sistem California High-Speed Rail yang sudah disetujui pemerintah. Ia menjuluki rencananya ""hyperloop"", mesin perjalanan udara subsonik yang merentang sekitar 350 mil (560 km) dari Sylmar (sebelah utara Los Angeles) hingga Hayward (sebelah timur San Francisco) dan secara teoretis memungkinkan komuter bepergian antarkota dalam waktu 30 menit atau kurang, sehingga waktu tempuhnya lebih pendek daripada pesawat komersial masa kini.[55] Rencana Musk akan membuat perjalanan lebih murah daripada mode transportasi jarak jauh lainnya. Biaya total untuk pembangunan sistem ini diperkirakan mencapai $6 miliar. Sistem ini rencananya menggunakan ruang vakum parsial untuk mengurangi gesekan aerodinamis yang memungkinkan perjalanan berkecepatan tinggi dengan konsumsi tenaga yang rendah.[56] Rencananya, kebutuhan listrik Hyperloop sepenuhnya bergantung pada tenaga surya. 
September 2013 lalu, sebuah perusahaan startup yang berbasis di California merekrut dua engineer ternama untuk membuat Hyperloop menjadi kenyataan. Perusahaan yang bernama JumpStartFund tersebut merekrut Marco Villa, mantan direktur operasi misi pada Space X[34] dan Patricia Galloway, yang merupakan presiden wanita pertama pada American Society of Civil Engineer.[57] 
Pada Desember 2015, Musk mengumumkan pendirian OpenAI, sebuah perusahaan riset kecerdasan buatan nirlaba (AI). OpenAI bertujuan untuk mengembangkan kecerdasan umum buatan dengan cara yang aman dan bermanfaat bagi umat manusia.[58] 
Dengan membuat AI tersedia untuk semua orang, OpenAI ingin ""menangkal perusahaan besar yang mungkin mendapatkan terlalu banyak kekuatan dengan memiliki sistem super-intelijen yang ditujukan untuk keuntungan, serta pemerintah yang dapat menggunakan AI untuk mendapatkan kekuatan dan bahkan menindas warga mereka"".[59] Musk telah menyatakan dia ingin menangkal konsentrasi kekuasaan.[60] Pada tahun 2018 Musk meninggalkan dewan OpenAI untuk menghindari kemungkinan konflik di masa depan dengan perannya sebagai CEO Tesla karena Tesla semakin terlibat dalam AI melalui Tesla Autopilot.[61] 
Namun, dalam sebuah wawancara dengan Joe Rogan pada September 2018, Musk memperingatkan tentang bahaya mengembangkan kecerdasan buatan tanpa pandang bulu. Pada Januari 2019 Mark Harris dari The Guardian mencatat bahwa pada tanggal 23 Januari yayasan Musk ""menambahkan garis ke situs webnya, menyatakan dukungannya untuk"" pengembangan kecerdasan buatan yang aman untuk memberi manfaat bagi kemanusiaan"""". 
Pada tahun 2016, Musk mendirikan Neuralink, sebuah neuroteknologi perusahaan startup untuk mengintegrasikan otak manusia dengan kecerdasan buatan. Perusahaan ini berpusat pada menciptakan perangkat yang dapat ditanamkan di otak manusia, dengan tujuan akhirnya membantu manusia bergabung dengan perangkat lunak dan mengimbangi kemajuan dalam kecerdasan buatan. Perangkat tambahan ini dapat meningkatkan memori atau memungkinkan lebih banyak berinteraksi langsung dengan perangkat komputasi.[62] Musk melihat Neuralink dan OpenAI sebagai terkait: ""OpenAI adalah organisasi nirlaba yang didedikasikan untuk meminimalkan bahaya kecerdasan buatan, sementara Neuralink bekerja pada cara untuk menanamkan teknologi ke dalam otak kita untuk menciptakan antarmuka pikiran-komputer.""[60] 
Pada 17 Desember 2016, ketika terjebak kemacetan, Musk mengirim tweet ""[Saya] akan membangun mesin bor terowongan dan mulai menggali   . . . "" Perusahaan itu bernama 'The Boring Company'.[63] Pada 21 Januari 2017, Musk tweeted ""Kemajuan yang menggembirakan di depan terowongan. Berencana untuk mulai menggali dalam sebulan atau lebih.""[64] Terowongan pertama akan dimulai di kampus SpaceX,[65] The Boring Test Tunnel berjalan di bawah West 120th Street. Hingga 26 Januari 2017[update], diskusi dengan badan pengawas telah dimulai.[66] 
Pada bulan Februari 2017, perusahaan mulai menggali ""parit uji"" selebar 30-kaki (9,1 m), sepanjang 50-kaki (15 m), dan sedalam 15-kaki (4,6 m) yang dalam di lokasi kantor Space X di Los Angeles, karena pembangunannya tidak memerlukan izin.[67][68] Musk telah mengatakan pada awal 2017 bahwa penurunan 10 kali lipat dalam biaya pengeboran terowongan per mil diperlukan untuk kelayakan ekonomi dari jaringan terowongan yang diusulkan.[69] Lebar terowongan dioptimalkan untuk kendaraan listrik saja, yang menghindari komplikasi ventilasi buang dengan mesin pembakaran internal.[70] 
Sebagai kesaudagaran, perusahaan ini menjual 20.000 ""penyembur api"" pada tahun 2018,[71][72] terinspirasi oleh film Spaceballs.[73] 
Gaya manajemen Musk dan perlakuannya terhadap karyawannya telah dikritik berat.[74][75][76][77] Business Insider melaporkan bahwa karyawan Tesla diberitahu untuk tidak melewati meja Musk karena ""amukan pemecatan liar""nya.[78] The Wall Street Journal melaporkan bahwa, setelah ia bersikeras untuk mencap kendaraannya sebagai kendaraan yang ""mengemudi sendiri"", ia dikritik para insinyurnya, dimana beberapa akhirnya mundur setelah itu. Salah satu insinyur mengatakan bahwa ""pengambilan keputusan Musk yang ceroboh... telah berpotensi mempertaruhkan nyawa para konsumen.""[79] Buku terbitan tahun 2021 Power Play berisi beberapa anekdot dari Musk mencaci karyawannya.[80] 
Musk adalah ketua Musk Foundation yang berfokus pada program filantropi di bidang pendidikan sains, kesehatan pediatrik, dan energi hijau. Ia adalah anggota dewan pengawas X Prize Foundation, yayasan yang mempromosikan teknologi energi terbarukan. Ia merupakan anggota dewan Space Foundation, National Academies Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board, Planetary Society, dan Stanford Engineering Advisory Board. Musk juga merupakan anggota dewan pengawas California Institute of Technology (Caltech). 
Ia memulai sebuah program multimiliar dolar melalui yayasannya pada tahun 2010 berupa sumbangan sistem tenaga surya darurat di daerah-daerah bencana. Instalasi tenaga surya darurat pertama disumbangkan ke pusat tanggap bencana badai di Alabama yang tidak tersentuh bantuan negara bagian dan federal. Untuk memperjelas bahwa bantuan ini tidak ditunggangi kepentingan komersial Musk, SolarCity mengatakan bahwa mereka tidak punya rencana aktivitas bisnis di Alabama.[81] Dalam kunjungan tahun 2011 ke Soma City di Fukushima, Jepang, yang diterjang tsunami, ia menyumbangkan proyek tenaga surya senilai $250.000 kepada pemerintah kota.[82] 
Musk punya rencana untuk proyek ""Mars Oasis"" pada tahun 2001. Proyek ini berupa pembangunan miniatur rumah kaca uji coba di Mars berisi bahan makanan yang tumbuh di tanah regolith Mars.[83][84] Ia menunda proyek ini setelah mengetahui bahwa masalah mendasar yang menghambat umat manusia untuk menjadi peradaban pengarung angkasa sejati adalah keterbelakangan teknologi roket. Ia berusaha memecahkan masalah ini dengan mendirikan SpaceX untuk menciptakan roket-roket antarplanet revolusioner baru. 
Tujuan jangka panjangnya adalah membantu umat manusia menciptakan peradaban pengarung angkasa sejati melalui SpaceX.[85] Filosofi Musk dan penjelasan tentang apa yang diperlukan untuk menyelesaikan masalah ini disertakan dalam podcast IEEE berujul ""Elon Musk: a founder of Paypal, Tesla Motors, and SpaceX""[86] dan artikel ""Risky Business.""[84] 
Musk bergabung dengan The Giving Pledge pada April 2012 dan memberikan komitmen etis berupa donasi sebagian besar kekayaannya untuk program filantropis.[87] Musk menjadi anggota kampanye yang pertama kali dipopulerkan Warren Buffett dan Bill Gates ini. Kampanye ini diikuti keluarga dan orang-orang terkaya di Amerika Serikat, termasuk Arthur Blank dan Michael Moritz.[87] 
Blog otomotif Jalopnik melaporkan pada 16 Agustus 2012 bahwa Musk mendukung upaya Matthew Inman dari The Oatmeal untuk melindungi situs laboratorium Nikola Tesla di Long Island, New York, dan mengubahnya menjadi museum, Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe.[88] 
Musk pernah mendukung komite aksi publik (PAC) Amerika Serikat FWD.us yang dirintis pengusaha ternama Mark Zuckerberg dan menyuarakan reformasi imigrasi. Sayangnya, pada Mei 2013, Musk menarik dukungannya sebagai bentuk protes atas iklan yang dijalankan PAC ini yang mendukukng proyek-proyek seperti Keystone Pipeline. PAC memang lazim mendukung kedua sisi spektrum politik agar mendapat simpati para pembuat keputusan demi menggolkan tujuan utama grup ini. Musk dan beberapa anggota penting lainnya, termasuk David Sacks, menarik dukungannya dan mengkritik strategi organisasi yang dianggap ""sinis"".[89] 
Musk merupakan Direktur Planetary Society, anggota dewan pengawas The X-Prize Foundation, dan anggota Stanford University Engineering Advisory Board. Ia sebelumnya menjabat sebagai anggota United States National Academy of Sciences Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board.[106] Dalam survei Space Foundation tahun 2010, Musk dijuluki pahlawan luar angkasa paling terkenal ke-10 (bersama perintis dan ilmuwan roket Wernher von Braun).[107] 
Musk menyebut dirinya sebagai pekerja aktif yang secara rutin menghabiskan 100 jam per minggu untuk mengurus Tesla Motors dan SpaceX dan sering bepergian menggunakan jet perusahaan.[110] 
Pabrik SpaceX pernah dijadikan lokasi syuting Iron Man 2 dan Musk tampil kameo di film ini.[111] 
Musk sebelumnya memiliki mobil sport McLaren F1 dan pesawat jet Aero L-39 buatan Ceko.[112] Pesawat Dassault Falcon 900 model 1994-nya dipakai dalam film Thank You for Smoking (2005) dan terdaftar atas nama Musk (N900SX).[113] Musk tampil kameo di film tersebut sebagai pilot pesawatnya, pembuka pintu untuk Robert Duvall, dan pengawal Aaron Eckhart ke luar negeri.[114]
Musk menghadiri festival Burning Man tahun 2004 dan mengaku bahwa di sana ia mendapatkan ide tentang SolarCity.[51] Ia juga mengusulkan sistem terowongan jet tenaga surya bernama Hyperloop yang memungkinkan perjalanan dari San Francisco ke Los Angeles dalam waktu kurang dari 30 menit.[115] 
Musk tinggal di Bel Air, Los Angeles, California. Musk bertemu istri pertamanya, penulis asal Kanada Justine Musk, ketika masih kuliah di Queen's University. Mereka menikah tahun 2000.[116] Mereka menyatakan bercerai pada September 2008. Pada Januari 2012, Musk mengumumkan bahwa ia mengakhiri hubungannya selama empat tahun dengan istri keduanya, aktris asal Britania Raya Talulah Riley.[20][117] 
Musk memiliki lima anak laki-laki, kembar dua dan kembar tiga. Mereka diasuh oleh Elon dan Justine Musk.[20] 
Tosca Musk, kakak Elon, adalah pendiri Musk Entertainment dan telah memproduksi banyak film.[118][119] Elon menjadi produser eksekutif film pertama besutan Tosca, Puzzled.[120] Adiknya, Kimbal, adalah CEO perusahaan pencarian sosial OneRiot dan pemilik restoran The Kitchen yang berlokasi di Boulder dan Denver, Colorado.[121] 
Sepupunya, Lyndon Rive, merupakan CEO dan pendiri pendamping Solar City.[48][49]  "

Elon Reeve Musk, född 28 juni 1971 i Pretoria, Sydafrika, är en sydafrikansk-amerikansk entreprenör och industrimagnat. Han är VD och CTO för SpaceX ...","Elon Reeve Musk, född 28 juni 1971 i Pretoria, Sydafrika, är en sydafrikansk-amerikansk entreprenör och industrimagnat. Han är VD och CTO för SpaceX, VD och produktarkitekt på Tesla Motors, VD för Twitter samt VD för Neuralink. Han är grundare av SpaceX, Neuralink och The Boring Company samt en av grundarna till OpenAI och Zip2. Han var en av medgrundarna till företaget X.com, som senare slogs samman med Confinity och blev Paypal. Musk är en av de rikaste människorna i världen. Han utsågs 2021 av Time Magazine till Person of the Year.[3] 
Musk lade ett bud på Twitter, Inc för 44 miljarder dollar år 2022, men drog tillbaka sitt bud.[4] Detta ledde till att Twitter stämde Musk. Den 27 oktober 2022 slutfördes emellertid Musks köp av Twitter.[5] 
Elon Musk föddes 1971 i Pretoria[6] i Sydafrika som son till Errol Musk, en sydafrikansk elektromekanisk ingenjör, och Maye Musk (född Haldeman), ursprungligen modell från Kanada. Efter att föräldrarna skilde sig 1980 bodde Musk mestadels hos sin far på olika platser i Sydafrika.[7]
Musk har dock i vuxen ålder haft en ansträngd relation med sin far.[8] 
Vid tio års ålder började Musk använda Commodore VIC-20. Han lärde sig datorprogrammering och vid tolv års ålder sålde han koden till TV-spelet kallat Blastar till en tidning som heter PC and Office Technology för cirka 500 amerikanska dollar. En version av spelet är tillgänglig på webben.[9] 
Musk gick på den engelskspråkiga privatskolan Waterkloof House Preparatory School och sedan på den statliga skolan Pretoria Boys High School. Därefter flyttade han från Sydafrika till Kanada i juni 1989, strax före sin 18-årsdag, efter att ha erhållit kanadensiskt medborgarskap genom sin kanadensiskfödda mor.[10] 
Vid 19 års ålder blev Elon Musk antagen till Queens University i Kingston i Ontario, Kanada för studier på grundnivå. 1992, efter att ha tillbringat två år på Queens University, fortsatte Musk vid University of Pennsylvania i USA. Där tog han, 24 år gammal, en kandidatexamen i fysik på Penn College of Arts and Sciences och en kandidatexamen i nationalekonomi vid Wharton School. Musk stannade ett år för att avsluta sin andra kandidatexamen. När han gick på University of Pennsylvania hyrde Musk och kollegan Adeo Ressi ett 10-sovrums ""fraternity house"" och använde detta som en inofficiell nattklubb. 1995, vid 24 års ålder, flyttade Musk till Kalifornien för att påbörja en doktorandutbildning i tillämpad fysik vid Stanford University, men lämnade programmet efter två dagar för att fullfölja sina entreprenöriella ambitioner inom internet, förnybar energi och yttre rymden. År 2002 blev han amerikansk medborgare.[11] 
1995 grundade han företaget Zip2[12],[13] vars affärsidé var att tillhandahålla publiceringsprogram för internetbaserat material från nyhetsföretag. 1999 köpte Compaq Zip2[12] för 307 miljoner dollar och aktier till ett värde av 34 miljoner dollar.[14] Musk ägde vid tidpunkten 7 procent och tillsammans med sin bror Kimbal ungefär 12 procent av aktierna[15] i Zip2[12]. 
I mars 1999 grundade Musk tillsammans med partners X.com vilket var ett företag som tillhandahöll betalningslösningar via internet.[13] Ett år senare köpte X.com Confinity, vilket var ett bolag skapat för att skicka pengar mellan Palm Pilots.[16] Företaget fokuserade efter detta enbart på transaktioner via e-post genom domänen Paypal som var en del av köpet av Confinity. Februari 2001 bytte X.com namn till Paypal. Oktober 2002 köptes Paypal upp av Ebay för Ebayaktier värda 1,5 miljarder dollar.[17] Vid tiden för köpet var Musk företagets största enskilda aktieägare med 11,7 % av Paypals aktier, detta till värde av 165 miljoner dollar.[18] År 2017 köpte Musk tillbaka domännamnet X.com från PayPal för ett okänt belopp. [19] 
I juni 2002 grundade Musk sitt tredje företag, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), i vilket han är VD och teknisk direktör. Utöver detta är Musk även styrelsemedlem i SolarCity och var med och utvecklade transportmetoden Hyperloop.[20][21] 
Elon Musk har sagt att artificiell intelligens (AI) är potentiellt farligare än kärnvapen.[22] 
År 2017 vann Musk priset Oslo Business for Peace Award.[23] 
Musks förmögenhet uppskattades 2015 till cirka 13,2 miljarder amerikanska dollar.[24] Den 17 november 2020 meddelades att Elon Musk och Tesla är med i aktieindexet S&P 500. År 2021 blev Elon Musk världens rikaste person, med en förmögenhet som beräknades vara 185 miljarder amerikanska dollar.[25] 
Politiskt har Elon Musk beskrivit sig själv som ""hälften demokrat, hälften republikan""; med hans egna ord: ""Jag är någonstans i mitten, socialt liberal och skattemässigt konservativ.""[26] Från och med slutet av 2010-talet har Musks politiska bidrag skiftat till att nästan helt stödja republikaner.[27] 2022 sa Musk att han ""inte längre kunde stödja"" demokraterna eftersom de är ""parti av splittring och hat"".[28] 
Musk har uttalat sin beundran för den tidigare brittiska premiärministern Margaret Thatcher; ""Jag har alltid beundrat Margaret Thatcher – hon var tuff, men klok och rättvis."" Vidare har han sagt: ""Hon var långt ifrån perfekt, men hennes handlingar var på det hela taget bra.""[29] 
Musk har sagt att den amerikanska regeringen inte borde ge subventioner till företag, Han har förspråkat införandet av en koldioxidskatt.[30] 
Elon Musk är en självutnämnd amerikansk exceptionalist. Han beskriver sig själv som ""nauseatingly pro-American"" (""kväljande proamerikansk""). Enligt Musk är USA ""tveklöst det bästa landet som någonsin har funnits på jorden"" och beskriver det som ""den största kraft för det goda av något land som någonsin har varit"". Musk anser direkt att det ""inte skulle vara demokrati i världen om inte vore för Förenta staterna""; argumenterar på ""tre olika tillfällen under 1900-talet där demokratin skulle ha fallit med första världskriget, andra världskriget och det kalla kriget, om det inte varit för USA"".[31] 
Elon Musk har varit gift tre gånger med två kvinnor. Han har 11 barn.[32] 
År 2000 gifte Musk sig med den kanadensiska författaren Justine Wilson. Paret fick en son som dog i plötslig spädbarnsdöd. Med hjälp av IVF fick de sedan tvillingar år 2004 och trillingar år 2006. Paret separerade 2008. År 2022 bytte en av tvillingarna officiellt sitt namn för att spegla sin könsidentitet som transkvinna. Hon började också använda Wilson som efternamn eftersom hon inte längre ville förknippas med Musk.[33] Musk skyllde konflikten med sin dotter på vad Financial Times beskrev som ""nymarxisters förmodade övertagande av elitskolor och universitet.""[34] 
År 2010 gifte han om sig med skådespelaren Talulah Riley. De skilde sig 2012, gifte om sig 2013 och skilde sig igen år 2016.[35][36] 
Mellan 2018 och 2022 hade han ett förhållande med Claire Boucher, mer känd under artistnamnet Grimes.[37] I maj 2020 föddes parets första son.[38][39][40] De har tre barn.  
När Musk medverkade i Saturday Night Live i maj 2021, berättade han att han har Aspergers syndrom.[41]

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) announced that it has filed an application seeking an order directing Elon Musk (“Musk”) to ...","Company Filings   The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) announced that it has filed an application seeking an order directing Elon Musk (“Musk”) to comply with an investigative subpoena calling for his appearance for testimony, with which Musk failed to comply. If a person or entity refuses to comply with a subpoena issued by SEC enforcement staff pursuant to a formal order of investigation, the Commission may file a subpoena enforcement action in federal district court seeking an order compelling compliance. According to the SEC staff’s filing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the testimony subpoena to Musk relates to an ongoing investigation by the SEC regarding, among other things, potential violations of various provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with (a) Musk’s 2022 purchases of Twitter, Inc. (“Twitter”) stock, and (b) Musk’s 2022 statements and SEC filings relating to Twitter. According to the filing, the SEC seeks Musk’s testimony to obtain information not already in the SEC’s possession that is relevant to its legitimate and lawful investigation. According to the filing, Musk failed to appear for testimony as required by the investigative subpoena served by the SEC, despite: (1) agreeing to appear for testimony on a mutually agreed upon date in September 2023; (2) having been served with a subpoena in May 2023 requiring his appearance for testimony in the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office on that mutually agreed upon date; and (3) raising no objection to the subpoena from May 2023 until two days before his scheduled testimony date in September 2023, when Musk notified the SEC that he would not appear. According to the filing, Musk attempted to justify his refusal to comply with the subpoena by raising, for the first time, several spurious objections.   The SEC staff’s application seeks an order from the court directing Musk to comply with the subpoena. The application is subject to the court’s ruling. The SEC staff is continuing its fact-finding investigation and, to date, has not concluded that any individual or entity has violated the federal securities laws. STAY CONNECTED

Elon Musk held a Twitter / X all-hands call on Thursday and discussed plans to transform the platform into a financial services hub, ...","By  Jacob Kastrenakes and  Alex Heath Elon Musk wants X to be the center of your financial world, handling anything in your life that deals with money. He expects those features to launch by the end of 2024, he told X employees during an all-hands call on Thursday, saying that people will be surprised with “just how powerful it is.” “When I say payments, I actually mean someone’s entire financial life,” Musk said, according to audio of the meeting obtained by The Verge. “If it involves money. It’ll be on our platform. Money or securities or whatever. So, it’s not just like send $20 to my friend. I’m talking about, like, you won’t need a bank account.” X CEO Linda Yaccarino said the company sees this becoming a “full opportunity” in 2024. “It would blow my mind if we don’t have that rolled out by the end of next year,” Musk said. Musk wants to beat PayPal with the PayPal playbook he wrote two decades ago The company is currently working on locking down money transmission licenses across the US so that it can offer financial services. Musk told employees Thursday that he hopes to get the others X needs in “the next few months.” Musk has discussed his plans to turn X into a financial hub before. He even renamed Twitter after his dot-com-boom-era online bank, X.com, which eventually became part of PayPal. He previously said the platform would offer high-yield money market accounts, debit cards, checks, and loan services, with the goal of letting users “send money anywhere in the world instantly and in real-time.” The original plan for X.com is clearly on Musk’s mind. “The X/PayPal product roadmap was written by myself and David Sacks actually in July of 2000,” Musk said on Thursday’s internal X call. “And for some reason PayPal, once it became eBay, not only did they not implement the rest of the list, but they actually rolled back a bunch of key features, which is crazy. So PayPal is actually a less complete product than what we came up with in July of 2000, so 23 years ago.” Turning X into a rich hub for financial services ties directly into Musk’s goal of making the platform into an “everything app,” akin to super apps like WeChat in China that offer access to shopping, transportation, and more.  Musk faces major challenges to get there, though. Convincing people why they need such a platform is one. Getting them to trust X with their entire financial life is another.

Irwin first joined Twitter in June 2022 after Musk had agreed to buy Twitter but had not yet taken control. She knew a Musk takeover was ..."," Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time Ella Irwin wasn’t always a public person. Before joining Twitter, she had worked in lower-profile roles, including in loss prevention at banks and then in trust and safety at companies like Google, Amazon and Twilio. That all changed in November 2022. Just five months after joining the company, she took on one of the most contentious jobs in all of tech: head of trust and safety for Twitter.  She would last just seven more months. In June, Irwin resigned from the company after Musk publicly criticized moderation actions that had been taken at the company around the issue of misgendering. “It absolutely was the hardest experience that I’ve gone through in my career,” Irwin, 48, said. In an interview with NBC News — her first since leaving the company — Irwin discussed why she left, what she thinks of Elon Musk’s leadership and his attacks on former employees, and what her next steps might be. She recently released the first episode of her new podcast, “The CryRoom,” which she co-hosts with Jess Anderson, who had a long career at tech companies like Salesforce but now runs an independent consulting firm and serves as vice president of cloud foundations at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.  Adding clarity to her sudden departure from the company, Irwin said that she resigned because it had become clear to her that “there was no longer alignment” between the company and her “nonnegotiable principles.”  “One was this notion of freedom of speech versus freedom of reach,” she said. “It was important to me that there was an understanding that hate speech, for example, violent graphic content, things like that, were not promoted, advertised, amplified.” The other, she said, was the principle of user choice.  “I’m a big believer in giving people the ability to make the decisions that are right for them,” she said. “Who they want to follow, what they don’t want to see, they should be able to create and choose their own adventure.”  Her comments come as X, formerly Twitter, is facing widespread criticism for how it has handled misinformation and terrorist content around the Israel-Hamas war, as well as an investigation from the European Commission on the matter.  Irwin called such misinformation “extremely upsetting,” noting that X is not alone in struggling with it.  “There is no doubt in my mind that there are a lot of people heads down, doing everything they can to solve for this,” she said. “I think about the damage that misinformation at scale can do to the product experience, the customer experience, to society. It’s one of the most important problems we need to solve for.” Musk has repeatedly suggested that X’s Community Notes feature can help address fake news and misinformation on the platform, but Irwin said she thinks more needs to be done.  “It can’t be your one solution,” she said. “It’s one of a whole toolbox of things that needs to happen.” Irwin’s interview offers a rare perspective on X under Musk from one of his former executives. Irwin said that she’s still under a nondisclosure agreement with the company, but that she plans to use her podcast to discuss professional and personal lessons from her time at X.  She said Musk came into then-Twitter with “startup energy,” looking to “move fast and make changes.” Some of the first changes he made were massive layoffs.  “I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like that,” Irwin said. Irwin first joined Twitter in June 2022 after Musk had agreed to buy Twitter but had not yet taken control. She knew a Musk takeover was possible but said she was attracted to the opportunity of helping to re-establish trust in one of the world’s largest social media companies.  She briefly left the company following the layoffs, but rejoined at Musk’s request. Irwin said that it wasn’t an easy decision, but that they had aligned on a few points.  She remembers them agreeing about wanting to get rid of “bad actors” on the platform and addressing the issue of child sexual exploitation material. (X has stated that its issues with child abuse content have improved. NBC News reporting has brought those statements into question.) Irwin also said the pair initially aligned on protecting speech on the platform through moderation that might affect the spread of certain content while rarely removing it. “My parents are both immigrants. And they came from a country that did not have freedom of speech. In fact, my grandfather was arrested and spent years in Siberia in a Siberian prison for criticizing the government,” Irwin said. “So my parents sort of instilled this strong respect for freedom of speech.” Shortly after Irwin re-joined the company, Musk published a series of incendiary anti-LGBTQ posts to X. In December 2022, he smeared Irwin’s predecessor, the recently departed Yoel Roth, adding onto a dogpile of tweets falsely suggesting that Roth, who is gay, had advocated for child grooming in a 2016 academic paper. The paper was Roth’s Ph.D. dissertation titled “Gay Data,” in which Roth argued for more wide-ranging safety features on gay dating apps. Roth argued that the apps should consider the fact that children, who are not allowed on the apps, were getting around rules and using them anyway, which should inform how dating apps create safety features. Musk misconstrued the paper, writing, “Looks like Yoel is arguing in favor of children being able to access adult Internet services in his PhD thesis.” Irwin said that she was not supportive of the comments, calling them “terrible” and saying that they went too far. But she said that some of the backlash Yoel received in response to the “Twitter Files,” a series of posts from conservative journalists who were given access to the company’s communications and moderation decisions, didn’t seem problematic to her because he was in a public-facing role. Irwin told the Daily Beast that she had limited involvement in the project. In a phone call, Roth said, “No corporation in history has voluntarily disclosed executive communications in this kind of way. It is not necessarily a great strategy,” explaining that he believes the stunt eroded trust at the company. ”I suppose it’s fair game for Musk to do it because he owns the company and he owns its intellectual property and he owns its legal liabilities, but it doesn’t strike me as beneficial.” Irwin described Musk as impulsive at times.  “There’s more emotion behind his decisions than I would have maybe expected before I met him,” Irwin said. “And I think that contributes to some of the impulsiveness.” Describing Musk’s public-facing behavior, Irwin said: “I think there were a lot of situations in which I would have handled things very differently. There were things that I wouldn’t have tweeted in the middle of the night, there were certainly things that could have been stated better.” Despite his tweets, Irwin said she learned a lot from working with Musk. “Elon is very good at questioning everything, boiling things down to first principles, removing constraints, and that can be very powerful when you need to drive a lot of change very quickly,” she said.  Irwin, whose role expanded at the company to include interacting with some journalists, said she clashed with Musk on how to handle communications with reporters. Musk is notoriously critical of the media and has eliminated much of the internal infrastructure at his companies that were previously devoted to communicating with journalists. When Musk took over, the company created an autoreply for its media email that responded to all inquiries with a poop emoji. Irwin said she believed that actions like that made the company worse off.  “There was an environment where the press was not able to get to ask questions,” which she believes leads to speculation and the use of unreliable sources. “I think it would have been beneficial to be more open,” she said. “We definitely had conversations about that. There’s a reason that I was able to comment to the press at times.”  In June, Irwin became part of the news after a chaotic 24 hours at X ended with her leaving the company.  Under the principle of “freedom of speech, not freedom of reach,” an anti-trans documentary called “What Is A Woman?” had been restricted on the platform. Conservative backers of the film launched a campaign to change that, complaining that they were being censored and that X had canceled a distribution deal with them because the film contains instances of misgendering. Musk responded in a tweet, saying that misgendering “is definitely allowed” and blamed unnamed employees for throttling the film.  “This was a mistake by many people at Twitter,” Musk wrote, adding, “Whether or not you agree with using someone’s preferred pronouns, not doing so is at most rude and certainly breaks no laws.”  Some users still complained, saying they couldn’t share or comment on the video. The next day, Musk shared the documentary himself and said he had removed any restrictions on the video. Hours later, it was reported that Irwin was leaving the company. At the time, she didn’t elaborate on why.  But she did in her interview with NBC News. “When I felt like there was no longer alignment to those core principles, I felt it was time to leave.” Musk has since made moves that Irwin said illustrated that divide. In August, he said that X would eventually eliminate its blocking feature.  “I don’t want to have a negative experience every time I log into Twitter,” Irwin said about the idea. It’s now been four months since Irwin’s resignation from the company, and she says she’s enjoying the break. “I’ve worked every day since I was 14 years old, and with the exception of a few short vacations a year, I haven’t really ever had a real break even between jobs, so I wanted to give myself this time,” she said. “Having said that, I have been talking to a few companies recently.” Irwin wouldn’t divulge which companies, but asked if she would ever return to X, Irwin was taken aback. “You never say never, right? But I think there would have to be a lot of things that would have to change,” she said. “Companies change, leadership teams change, a lot of things happen — but I don’t know that that would happen anytime soon.” Ben Goggin is the deputy editor for technology at NBC News Digital. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Musk said in a post on social media platform X that it was not clear who has authority for ground links in Gaza, but we do know that ""no terminal has requested a connection in that area"". A telephone and internet blackout isolated people in the Gaza Strip from the world and from each other on Saturday, with calls to loved ones, ambulances or colleagues elsewhere all but impossible as Israel widened its air and ground assault. International humanitarian organizations said the blackout, which began late on Friday, was worsening an already desperate situation by impeding life-saving operations and preventing contact with their staff on the ground. SpaceX did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on how it would ensure any Starlink connection was used by aid organizations and not by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip. Responding to Musk's post on X, Israel's communication minister Shlomo Karhi said Israel ""will use all means at its disposal to fight this."" ""HAMAS will use it for terrorist activities,"" Karhi wrote. ""Perhaps Musk would be willing to condition it with the release of our abducted babies, sons, daughters, elderly people. All of them! By then, my office will cut any ties with starlink."" Following Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Starlink satellites were reported to have been critical to maintaining internet connectivity in some areas despite attempted Russian jamming. Since then, Musk has said he declined to extend coverage over Russian-occupied Crimea, refusing to allow his satellites to be used for Ukrainian attacks on Russian forces there.

The tech billionaire is expected to attend the global summit on artificial intelligence ahead of this meeting. The summit, at Bletchley Park, hopes to bring together AI experts and global leaders to discuss the potential risks of artificial intelligence.   US Vice-President Kamala Harris and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are due to attend.  The BBC also understands Open AI's Sam Altman and Meta's Nick Clegg will join the gathering - as well as a host of other tech leaders.  At least two of the so-called godfathers of AI will be attending.  Yoshua Bengio has confirmed to the BBC he will be there. It is also understood that Prof Yann LeCun, Meta's chief AI scientist, will be there.  In contrast to the other godfathers Mr LeCun has described fears that AI could pose a threat to humanity as ""ridiculously preposterous"" and has posted critically about the summit on X (formerly Twitter). In a post on X, Mr Sunak said: ""In conversation with Elon Musk. After the AI Safety Summit. Thursday night on X."" It was revealed on Monday that X, which Mr Musk acquired for $44bn (£36bn), is now worth $19bn, according to internal correspondence first reported by Fortune. Mr Musk launched his own AI venture, xAI in June. He was also one of the original backers of OpenAI but parted ways with the firm. There is a chance that Rishi Sunak is walking into a lion's den here in agreeing to a live-streamed conversation with Elon Musk on Musk's own platform, X. Musk has not yet been vocal about the UK's new Online Safety Act, which has only just gained Royal Assent, but X is firmly in scope to be bound by its laws and that may not sit well with the self-proclaimed ""free speech absolutist"".  What Musk says and what he actually does are not always in harmony: he has called for a pause on AI development but also registered his own AI company and has reportedly been buying large quantities of the specialist chips required. He will has strong views of his own on how AI should progress. He has a large audience but he's also not an elected individual, in any country, and arguably no government or global coalition should be too much in thrall. You can read more about what's next for Elon Musk's X here. Recent advances in AI have been hailed as revolutionary but also dangerous - even a possible threat to humanity itself. It could lead to mass job losses and supercharge disinformation.  On Monday US President Joe Biden signed an executive order that would require AI developers to share safety results with the US government. However, Mr Musk may argue for the US and other countries to go further.  In March he signed an open letter calling for a pause to ""Giant AI Experiments"". In an interview with the BBC in April Mr Musk said he had been worrying about AI safety for over a decade. ""I think there should be a regulatory body established for overseeing AI to make sure that it does not present a danger to the public,"" he said. Mr Musk has also pitted himself against AI companies due to the data they use to train chatbots - the software that learns how humans interact by scraping masses of data from various sources to fuel its knowledge and interaction styles.

The latest change to the platform will see two layers of subscriptions - one with adverts and one without.","Elon Musk has said his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, will launch two new tiers of premium subscriptions. ""One is lower cost with all features, but no reduction in ads, and the other is more expensive, but has no ads,"" the billionaire said in a post on X. It comes as the firm started charging new users $1 in New Zealand and the Philippines for accessing the platform. Mr Musk did not provide more details on the plans. New users who opt out of subscribing will only be able to take ""read only"" actions, such as reading posts, watching videos, and following accounts, the company said in its website. It is not clear if there will be any free options. Mr Musk has long said that his solution for getting rid of bots and fake accounts on the social media platform is charging for the service.  Since taking over the firm in October last year he has looked to incentivise users to pay for an enhanced service, which is now called X Premium. Some users now opt to pay $8 per month for the blue check subscription service. Its ""Not A Bot"" subscription method aims to reduce spam, manipulation of the platform and bot activity. He has also tried to woo advertisers back to X with offers of discounts. Mr Musk's rapid changes, including mass layoffs and disbanding content moderation teams, has led to advertisers halting ads on the service. He acknowledged that the platform has taken a hit on revenue and blamed activists for pressuring advertisers. Other big tech companies have also experimented with a mix of ad-supported and subscription plans.  While Alphabet's YouTube has both paid and free, ad-supported ones, Netflix's ad-supported plans are also chargeable, though at a lower price. YouTube, which like X is populated by content from users, shares a part of its subscription revenue with creators. X, which also shares some of its ad revenue with content creators, did not disclose if content creators will be paid in ad-free subscription models. Despite Mr Musk's attempts to generate revenue on X, as the company faced criticism over lax content moderation, advertisers have not come flooding back over concerns their ads might appear next to inappropriate content. Last week, the European Commission launched an investigation into X to see whether it complies with new tech rules on illegal and harmful content following the spread of disinformation on its platform after Hamas's attack on Israel.

The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, CNN, Bloomberg, Vox and other news organizations still had their gold badges as of Thursday afternoon. Times accounts related to coverage of world news, health and other subjects still show “verified” badges. After this story was published Thursday, the Times’ main account was given a blue “verified” badge. A Times spokesperson said Friday that X “continues to provide no information or explanation for any of these moves.” The move further extends Musk’s attempts to use the social media company he bought with claims of defending free speech to undercut news organizations he dislikes. It also suggests Musk has adopted the kinds of secretive social media tactics he and Twitter’s conservative critics once loudly denounced. Neither X nor Musk responded to requests for comment. In April, after Musk bought the company for $44 billion, X ended its years-old system of giving badges to politicians, journalists and other public figures whose identity it had verified. Replacing it was a pay-for-play scheme extending blue badges to any individual who pays $8 a month and gold badges to any “verified organization” that pays at least $1,000 a month. After the Times declined to pay the fee, Musk tweeted support for its badge to be immediately removed and the Times became the first major account to lose verification. Later in April, X reinstated the badge for the Times and other big accounts, including for those who declined to pay or said they didn’t want it. Neither the Times nor The Post has ever paid the fee, according to people familiar with both organizations. The verification system change has made it more challenging for users to seek out official or authoritative information during major news events. A study released Thursday by the media-rating service NewsGuard found that 74 percent of the worst Israel-Gaza misinformation on X had been spread by paid-for blue “verified” accounts. Musk has repeatedly attacked the Times, saying in August that the news organization supports “calls for genocide” and that “if ever there was a time to cancel that publication, it is now.” Within days of that post, X had implemented a five-second delay for clicks to the Times’ website. After The Post reported on the delay, X removed it for the Times without explanation but kept it in place for other X competitors, including Facebook, Instagram, Substack and Bluesky, according to a technical analysis from the news outlet The Markup. Even without the delay, traffic to the Times’ website from X links has plunged roughly 50 percent since August, according to a person familiar with the change. That steep drop outpaces an industry-wide slowdown in referrals to top news sites from X and Facebook this year, according to industry data from the analytics firm Similarweb first reported by Axios. On Wednesday, Musk echoed a comment from the far-right influencer Ian Miles Cheong, who in March shared a fake manifesto falsely attributed to a Nashville school shooter, saying the Times had “uncritically regurgitated propaganda” and laughed off a criticism that Musk had removed features making it possible to tell real journalists from fakes. Musk replied, “'Real journalists’ lmaooo.” The Times runs the 25th most-followed account on X, according to data from the social media analytics firm Social Blade. Earlier this month, X removed headlines from news articles and other links on the platform and demoted posts with links in its recommendation system — two moves that a Cardiff University professor told The Post were “part of a larger trend toward making Twitter/X more difficult for news organizations to use.” Musk said his goal was to maximize the time people spent on X and said “there is less time spent if people click away.” In the months since Musk bought X, the social media site has cut back on content moderation, suspended journalists, reinstated neo-Nazis and threatened to file defamation lawsuits against critics such as the Anti-Defamation League. The platform has also shed users and advertisers. In April, NPR became the first major news organization to stop using the platform after its account was labeled as “state-affiliated media.” In the six months since, NPR’s website traffic has dropped by only 1 percent, according to an internal memo first shared by the news journal Nieman Reports.

He ...","The X owner has no time for a democratic experiment dedicated to knowledge. He would rather yell puerile ‘jokes’ into the ether Just before the 2017 UK general election, I was introduced to the distinction between the good internet and the bad internet, democratically speaking. First, I had to learn what “civic tech” meant. In the broadest possible terms, it’s using online platforms to do socially useful things, rather than sell things, buy things or whip each other into an unspeakable fury about stuff that we didn’t care about five minutes ago. The civic tech expert Ed Saperia used as his parable the difference between Wikipedia and Facebook. Jimmy Wales’s big experiment, which started life in 1999 as Nupedia, has created an open-source collection of human knowledge in hundreds of languages that is essentially trustworthy. If a mistake creeps in through the gates of human generosity, it gets corrected in the same way. If malicious actors try to slander their foes, the punishment is not cancellation, but more like lifelong ridicule, which is proportionate, given how long a slanderous person is likely to carry on doing ridiculous things. In other words, it is the best of humanity, all natural desire to help each other with cross-pollinated knowledge concentrated in one place. Facebook, for brevity, takes the same raw material – all the people in the world – and finds the worst in it. Facebook manages to winkle out things we didn’t know we were capable of – levels of vitriol, gullibility and hysteria – in between a scare ad for dark politics and a mesmerising video of five types of mince baked around a kilo of cheese. (I am paraphrasing a bit; I don’t think civic tech gurus dwell much on the cheese.) If you could work out how these two projects became so different, you would probably have a blueprint for the next phase of the internet. Regulation sounds fanciful and boring, but socialisation? That would work: corralling the wild west into a functioning global community. I figured that the best contribution I could make was to stop ignoring that “please give us two quid” banner at the top of Wikipedia. All this was after the phrase “fake news” had been invented and repurposed by Donald Trump to toxify information everywhere. While the right minds are tackling this problem, a lot of the wrong minds have been doing so as well. As the Nobel Peace prize winner Maria Ressa has warned, online misinformation could end democracy as we know it. So, the sight of Elon Musk charging towards Wikipedia with his trademark guile and delicacy was so predictable that it was almost relaxing. He saw a collective resource that people prized and he wanted to hurt it. Why does Wales even need any money to run Wikipedia in the first place, he wondered on Sunday. You could fit the entire thing on your phone, he claimed. Eleven minutes later, he offered $1bn if it would change its name to Dickipedia. After Musk’s adventures on X, formerly Twitter, his views on what things cost and the relevance of what you can fit on your phone mostly evoke the thought: “Wow, to think I once took as read that tech bro billionaires knew what they were talking about!” The rest just make you wince. We called Twitter a sink even before Musk bought it, but that misses one fact: there were people making dick jokes that were funny about a thousand times an hour. Of the many points Musk missed when he bought Twitter, one concerned the standard of content he was seeking to govern. It’s like watching a drunk frat boy bowl up and flash Dorothy Parker. Wincing and scorn aside, Musk is after Wikipedia for a reason. The sight of something created socially that works is an insult to him. I would spend two quid a month, or more, just for that.

	These waters are getting choppy. 
	On the same day in mid-September that Warner Bros. dropped the trailer for its $215 million “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” embarrassing documents from the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial surfaced on Reddit, creating a new headache for the studio behind the film. 
	Depp fans paid the court fees for the release of documents from Heard’s therapist, Dr. Dawn Hughes. The raw notes, scribbled on a legal pad, were part of last year’s high-profile trial in which Depp largely prevailed. They describe a hostile “Aquaman” set where an allegedly intoxicated Jason Momoa dressed like Depp and pushed to have Heard booted from the role of aquatic superhero Mera. 	        	“Jason said he wanted me fired,” the notes say. “Jason drunk — late on set. Dressing like Johnny. Has all the rings too.” 
	A rep for Momoa declined comment, but a DC spokesperson pushed back on Heard’s characterization, saying, “Jason Momoa conducted himself in a professional manner at all times on the set of ‘Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.’” Others echoed that sentiment. “Jason works his ass off, likes to have a beer once in a while like everyone, but doesn’t show up drunk to set,” says an insider who was on the London set in 2021, adding that the two stars got along and were seen joking together. “And he isn’t dressing like Johnny Depp. He has always dressed in that bohemian style.”  
	Heard declined comment, but a source close to the actress confirmed that the notes refer to the “Aquaman 2” set and reflect a session from Dec. 27, 2021. Another source close to the actress says her lawyers fought the release of the therapy notes, which had been subpoenaed by Depp’s attorneys during discovery. 
	Momoa wasn’t the only “Aquaman” principal to land in the crosshairs. The therapy session also painted a picture of Heard feeling unsupported by the film’s director, James Wan, and treated like a pariah because of her high-profile legal battle with her ex-husband. 
	“He raised his voice @ me — ‘I can’t even post about Aquaman’ — made it like it was my fault – I said ‘I’m sorry,’” say Hughes’ notes in reference to Wan. “Nobody could take selfies with me on set given blackout.” 
	Wan declined comment. The DC spokesperson says, “James is known for treating members of his cast and crew with the utmost respect and for fostering a positive, collaborative environment on set — the ‘Aquaman’ films were no exception.” 	      	And yet Heard was nearly fired, sources on both sides tell Variety. Following “Aquaman’s” release in 2018, the studio and Wan decided to drop the actress from the sequel due to her lack of chemistry with Momoa and sent a letter to her attorney, Karl Austen, informing him of its decision. (Former DC Films boss Walter Hamada testified in the defamation trial about the “issue of chemistry.”) Those sources underscore that the move to bounce Heard was unrelated to Depp and took place before he filed suit against the actress in 2019. Likewise, Momoa was not involved in the decision-making. But another source pushed back on the lack-of-chemistry narrative, noting that Heard did a chemistry test with Momoa before landing the role of Mera and beat out two other actresses who did a similar chemistry test, including Abbey Lee. 
	Ultimately, the studio never pulled the trigger on firing Heard because her former boyfriend, Elon Musk, had one of his litigators send a “scorched-earth letter to Warner Bros. threatening to burn the house down” if the actress wasn’t brought back for a sequel, says a source familiar with the behind-the-scenes battle. Warner Bros. caved and moved forward with Heard. (Musk did not respond to a request for comment.) 
	The drama is being rehashed at a time when DC Entertainment toppers James Gunn and Peter Safran are poised to close the book on the previous regime’s superhero slate with the Dec. 20 release of “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.” Since Warner Bros. chiefs Pam Abdy and Mike De Luca joined the studio in June 2022, followed by Gunn and Safran’s entrance four months later, the four have been saddled with DC duds they inherited, including this year’s “The Flash” ($271 million worldwide) and “Blue Beetle” ($128 million worldwide). 
	Still, the “Aquaman” sequel held promise considering that the character’s first outing earned $1.15 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing DC movie ever. But sources say the sequel has endured challenges outside of the Heard saga and was testing in the 60s before being recut in the summer of 2022. Despite the overhaul, the film continued to test in the 60s, prompting a new cut. “The movie is like this echo of regimes,” says one insider. “It’s the last remnant of the Snyderverse, and no one really wants to take ownership of it.” Reshoots took place right up until this year’s WGA strike in May. The on-set source disputes the idea that “Aquaman 2” is troubled, noting that the film was on time, under budget and needed only about a week of reshoots. 
	Like “Flash,” “Aquaman” can’t shake its lame duck trappings, with the DC universe getting overhauled under new leadership, marking Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav’s top priority. 
	In fact, none of the stars cast by Zack Snyder for 2016’s “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” and 2017’s “Justice League” — including Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller and Momoa — will reprise their roles in the new DC universe in character. Momoa may return, just not as Aquaman. Sources say the actor has engaged in talks to play Lobo, either in the 2025 reboot “Superman: Legacy,” written and directed by Gunn, or in a standalone film. In a confusing twist, Viola Davis, who played Amanda Waller in both of the recent “Suicide Squad” movies, will remain as that character in the Gunn-Safran DC universe in next year’s Max series “Waller” and possibly in the new “Superman” tentpole. Another outlier is Gunn’s Max series “Peacemaker,” which will be back for a second season with John Cena in the lead. 	      	Meanwhile, there has been some confusion on the series front about who is the ultimate gatekeeper. Unlike the Marvel-Disney relationship in which Marvel controls the creative process and Disney+ merely releases the content, Max is creatively involved with the DC slate. Gunn and Safran don’t enjoy the same autonomy as Marvel’s Kevin Feige. (A Max source says the collaboration between the DC team and Max executives Sarah Aubrey and Casey Bloys has been seamless, including on the upcoming series “The Penguin,” which was forced to shut down production after the WGA strike began but is expected resume shooting as soon as the SAG-AFTRA strike ends.) 
	Regardless, some on the lot are convinced that another company, most likely Universal, will buy Warner Bros. within two years, making recent DC subplots and upheavals feel quaint. 
	“The bottom line is they need to get DC to work whether Zaslav owns it, whether Brian Roberts owns it, whether somebody else owns it,” says LightShed’s Rich Greenfield, a Wall Street analyst and venture capitalist. 
	In the runup to the “Aquaman” sequel, Warner Bros. will outwardly back the film and hope for a China release like its “Barbie,” “The Flash” and “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” received. After all, the first “Aquaman” earned nearly $300 million in China alone. But those types of China numbers are a thing of the past. Neither “Barbie” nor “The Flash” landed anything close to “Aquaman’s” Middle Kingdom haul from 2018, earning $35.1 million and $25.9 million there, respectively. 
	For now, neither Momoa nor Heard will be promoting the film given the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike. But if the strike ends soon, now that the WGA has come to terms, the stars will be junketing, making it difficult for Warner Bros. and Wan to avoid Heard’s accusations that her role was significantly cut. At least two Heard scenes were cut from “Aquaman 2” — an action sequence that found Mera fighting Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and a love scene with Momoa — according to individuals familiar with the production. Other evidence of friction is hiding in plain sight. This summer, Momoa unfollowed Heard on Instagram. One source says he even blocked Heard from following him. 
	Turmoil aside, the sequel might just work at the box office. The first “Aquaman” also was ho-hum in early testing and found its footing in postproduction. A studio source says “Aquaman 2” is following a similar trajectory. Early tracking shows strong interest and puts the film’s opening on par with the first “Aquaman.” 
	“Everybody’s down on DC, but there is a chance, especially with the limited competition during the holiday season, that ‘Aquaman’ could still play like gangbusters because of lack of product,” says Jeff Bock, a box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations. “Sometimes the right film at the right time is all you need.” The Business of Entertainment"

Elon Musk, the owner of X and CEO of Tesla, says remote workers give off “Marie Antoinette vibes.”","Elon Musk has made no secret of his disdain for remote workers—and he’s now using Tesla earnings calls to double down on his stance.  The Tesla CEO had plenty to address on the third-quarter 2023 call on Wednesday: Revenue at Tesla came in below analysts’ expectations, as did earnings, with Musk also discussing the headwinds facing his customer base.  The owner of X—formerly known as Twitter—still managed to find time to drum home the importance of showing up to your place of work, repeating a well-known anecdote that he sleeps on the floor of Tesla factories when necessary.  Musk’s unusual sleeping habits aren’t limited to the EV maker—the SpaceX founder has also slept in the head offices at X, after buying the platform in October last year.  On the call with analysts this week, Musk drew parallels between working from home and costs, saying affordability isn’t an “option” for the majority of buyers at the moment.  “I mean, this is, like, some real Marie Antoinette vibes from people who say, ‘Why is there no work from home?’” Musk said, referencing the indulgent French queen who allegedly responded to the plight of the poor with: “Let them eat cake.” Musk, the richest man on earth, continued: “Like, what about all the people that have to come to the factory and fill the cars, or all [the] people that have to go to the restaurant and make your food and deliver your food? “What are you talking about? I mean, how detached from reality does the work-from-home crowd have to be? While they take advantage of all those…who cannot work from home.” The father of 11 known children continued: “You have to say, like, why did I sleep in the factory so many times? Because it mattered.” Linking his point back to the increasingly shaky outlook for consumer confidence—in the face of Fed rates at historic highs and inflation still well above the 2% benchmark—Musk said cost is not an “optional” consideration for the majority of people.  Justifying the controversial decision to slash prices on vehicles and software, Musk continued that cost is a “necessary” consideration: “We have to make our cars more affordable [so] that people can buy it.” Employees on Musk’s payroll won’t be surprised by their boss’s stance.  In June last year, Musk sidestepped the gentle tactics of his colleagues in Big Tech and ordered his white-collar workers back to their desks for a minimum of 40 hours a week.  Citing fairness, the leaked email from the Tesla CEO added the requirement is “less than [what] we ask of factory workers”—perhaps referencing staff in China who reportedly work 12-hour days, sleep on-site and have just one day off a week.  Likewise, after purchasing social media site Twitter for $44 billion last year, one of Musk’s first tasks was to get the platform’s hybrid and remote staff—which he calls the “laptop class”—back to their desks.  An email reportedly declaring that the “office is not optional” landed in Twitter employees’ inboxes around 2:30 a.m. on March 22, with staffers having previously received an email in November (also sent in the middle of the night) saying they‘d need to become “extremely hard-core” if they want to stay with the business.  The man reportedly worth $226 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, was forced to soften his stance on this “hard-core” culture, after more staff than he expected threatened to quit over the change.  “All that is required for approval is that your manager takes responsibility for ensuring that you are making an excellent contribution,” he wrote, adding that staffers should have in-person meetings with their colleagues not less than once per month.  One of Musk’s many rivals is Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates—with the former criticizing the latter many times over the past few years.  Gates is famously a hard worker, saying that he used to try to sleep as little as possible to compete with colleagues—and paid attention to which of his colleagues left the office last.  But in an interview with LinkedIn last year, Gates revealed he had changed his stance after seeing how businesses operated during the pandemic: “For a lot of activities a lot if the time, you don’t need to be in the office.  “I was impressed by how much we could get done on a global basis. The [Bill and Melinda Gates] Foundation operated at full speed, even though I haven’t been to those offices in a little over two years.”  Other CEOs echo Gates’ call for flexibility and experimentation moving forward: Dropbox CEO Drew Houston says employees can work remotely 90% of the time if they wish; Spotify famously has a “work from anywhere” policy, as does social media platform Reddit.  Other business titans have mandated staff return to the office—at least some of the time—in the name of efficiency.  JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy have both told staff they may have to leave if they don’t comply with the companies’ return to office mandates.  Meanwhile Goldman Sachs wants staff in five days a week, while Big Tech giants like Meta and Google are cracking down on RTO by threatening disciplinary action or performance markdowns if staff don’t comply.  © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited.

(AP Photo/Michel Euler, Pool, File) AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A California man who says he was harassed after Elon Musk amplified posts on his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, that falsely placed the man at a confrontation involving far-right protesters sued the billionaire for defamation in a lawsuit filed Monday.  Benjamin Brody, 22, is represented by Mark Bankston, a Texas attorney who won a defamation case last year against conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in a lawsuit brought by families of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting. Brody is seeking a jury trial in Austin, Texas, and unspecified damages of at least $1 million.  Attorneys for Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment left through a spokesperson.  In June, video posted to X showed a confrontation involving protesters near a Pride festival in Oregon. Some of those involved wore the same colors of the Proud Boys extremist group, according to The Oregonian. On X, some users falsely identified one of the participants as Brody, highlighting his post-college plans to work for the government to spread baseless assertions that federal agents were involved.  The lawsuit includes screenshots of Musk engaging with users spreading the posts involving Brody, including one in which Musk described it as a “probable false flag situation.” Brody, a recent college graduate who said he was in California when the event happened, came under harassment because of Musk’s reach, according to the lawsuit.  The posts by Musk were still on X as of Monday.  It is not the first time Musk has been sued for defamation. He defeated a lawsuit in 2019 from a British cave explorer who claimed he was branded a pedophile when the Tesla CEO called him “pedo guy” on what was then called Twitter. Musk’s tech company has also taken others to court over what is posted on the site. In August, X sued a group of researchers over accusations that their work highlighting an increase in hate speech on the platform cost the company millions of dollars of advertising revenue.

Filed under: The brain implant company Neuralink is pushing a needlessly risky approach, former employees say. 
    Finding the best ways to do good. 
   Of all Elon Musk’s exploits — the Tesla cars, the SpaceX rockets, the Twitter takeover, the plans to colonize Mars — his secretive brain chip company Neuralink may be the most dangerous. What is Neuralink for? In the short term, it’s for helping people with paralysis. But that’s not the whole answer.  Launched in 2016, the company revealed in 2019 that it had created flexible “threads” that can be implanted into a brain, along with a sewing-machine-like robot to do the implanting. The idea is that these threads will read signals from a paralyzed patient’s brain and transmit that data to an iPhone or computer, enabling the patient to control it with just their thoughts — no need to tap or type or swipe. So far, Neuralink has only done testing on animals. But in May, the company announced it had won FDA approval to run its first clinical trial in humans. Now, it’s recruiting paralyzed volunteers to study whether the implant enables them to control external devices. If the technology works in humans, it could improve quality of life for millions of people. Approximately 5.4 million people are living with paralysis in the US alone. But helping paralyzed people is not Musk’s end goal. That’s just a step on the way to achieving a much wilder long-term ambition. That ambition, in Musk’s own words, is “to achieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence.” His goal is to develop a technology that helps humans “merg[e] with AI” so that we won’t be “left behind” as AI becomes more sophisticated. This fantastical vision is not the sort of thing for which the FDA greenlights human trials. But work on helping people with paralysis? That can get a warmer reception. And so it has. But it’s important to understand that this technology comes with staggering risks. Former Neuralink employees as well as experts in the field alleged that the company pushed for an unnecessarily invasive, potentially dangerous approach to the implants that can damage the brain (and apparently has done so in animal test subjects) to advance Musk’s goal of merging with AI.  Neuralink did not respond to a request for comment. There are also ethical risks for society at large that go beyond just Neuralink. A number of companies are developing tech that plugs into human brains, which can decode what’s going on in our minds and has the potential to erode mental privacy and supercharge authoritarian surveillance. We have to prepare ourselves for what’s coming. Neuralink is a response to one big fear: that AI will take over the world. This is a fear that’s increasingly widespread among AI leaders, who worry that we may create machines that are smarter than humans and that have the ability to deceive us and ultimately seize control from us. In March, many of them, including Musk, signed an open letter calling for a six-month pause on developing AI systems more powerful than OpenAI’s GPT-4. The letter warned that “AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity” and went on to ask: “Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization?” Although Musk is not alone in warning about “civilizational risk” posed by AI systems, where he differs from others is in his plan for warding off the risk. The plan is basically: If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. Musk foresees a world where AI systems that can communicate information at a trillion bits per second will look down their metaphorical noses at humans, who can only communicate at 39 bits per second. To the AI systems, we’d seem useless. Unless, perhaps, we became just like them. A big part of that, in Musk’s view, is being able to think and communicate at the speed of AI. “It’s mostly about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and the digital version of yourself, particularly output,” he said in 2017. “Some high bandwidth interface to the brain will be something that helps achieve a symbiosis between human and machine intelligence and maybe solves the control problem and the usefulness problem.” Fast forward a half-dozen years, and you can see that Musk is still obsessed with this notion of bandwidth — the rate at which computers can read out information from your brain. It is, in fact, the idea that drives Neuralink. The Neuralink device is a brain implant, outfitted with 1,024 electrodes, that can pick up signals from a whole lot of neurons. The more electrodes you’ve got, the more neurons you can listen in on, and the more data you’ll get. Plus, the closer you can get to those neurons, the higher quality your data will be. And the Neuralink device gets very close to the neurons. The company’s procedure for implanting it requires drilling a hole in the skull and penetrating the brain. But there are less extreme ways to go about this. Other companies are proving it. Let’s break down what they’re doing — and why Musk feels the need to do something different. Neuralink isn’t the only company exploring brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for restoring people’s physical capabilities. Other companies like Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech, Paradromics, and Precision Neuroscience are also working in this space. So is the US military. In recent years, a lot of the research that’s made headlines has focused on brain implants that would translate paralyzed people’s thoughts into speech. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, for example, is working on BCIs that could pick up thoughts directly from your neurons and translate them into words in real time. (In the long term, the company says it aims to give everyone the ability to control keyboards, augmented reality glasses, and more, using just their thoughts.)  Earlier success in the BCI field focused not on speech, but on movement. In 2006, Matthew Nagle, a man with spinal cord paralysis, received a brain implant that allowed him to control a computer cursor. Soon Nagle was playing Pong using only his mind. Nagle’s brain implant, developed by the research consortium BrainGate, contained a “Utah” array, a cluster of 100 spiky electrodes that is surgically embedded into the brain. That’s only around one-tenth of the electrodes in Neuralink’s device. But it still enabled a paralyzed person to move a cursor, check email, adjust the volume or channel on a TV, and control a robotic limb. Since then, others with paralysis have achieved similar feats with BCI technology. While early technologies like the Utah array protruded awkwardly from the skull, newer BCIs are invisible to the outside observer once they’re implanted, and some are much less invasive. Synchron’s BCI, for example, builds on stent technology that’s been around since the 1980s. A stent is a metal scaffold that you can introduce into a blood vessel; it can be safely left there for decades (and has been in many cardiac patients, keeping their arteries open). Synchron uses a catheter to send a stent up into a blood vessel in the motor cortex of the brain. Once there, the stent unfurls like a flower, and sensors on it pick up signals from neurons. This has already enabled several paralyzed people to tweet and text with their thoughts. No open brain surgery necessary. No drilling holes in the skull. Musk himself has said that BCIs wouldn’t necessarily require open brain surgery, in a telling five-minute video at Recode’s Code Conference in 2016. “You could go through the veins and arteries, because that provides a complete roadway to all of your neurons,” he said. “You could insert something basically into the jugular and...” After the audience laughed nervously, he added, “It doesn’t involve chopping your skull off or anything like that.” In Neuralink’s early years, before the company had settled on its current approach — which does involve drilling into the skull — one of its research teams allegedly looked into the tamer intravascular approach, four former Neuralink employees told me. This team explored the option of delivering a device to the brain through an artery and demonstrated that it was feasible. But by 2019, Neuralink had rejected this option, choosing instead to go with the more invasive surgical robot that implants threads directly into the brain. Why? If the intravascular approach can restore key functioning to paralyzed patients, and also avoids some of the safety risks that come with crossing the blood-brain barrier, such as inflammation and scar tissue buildup in the brain, why opt for something more invasive than necessary?  The company isn’t saying. But according to Hirobumi Watanabe, who led Neuralink’s intravascular research team in 2018, the main reason was the company’s obsession with maximizing bandwidth. “The goal of Neuralink is to go for more electrodes, more bandwidth,” Watanabe said, “so that this interface can do way more than what other technologies can do.” After all, Musk has suggested that a seamless merge with machines could enable us to do everything from enhancing our memory to uploading our minds and living forever — staples of Silicon Valley’s transhumanist fantasies. Which perhaps helps make sense of the company’s dual mission: to “create a generalized brain interface to restore autonomy to those with unmet medical needs today and unlock human potential tomorrow.” “Neuralink is explicitly aiming at producing general-purpose neural interfaces,” the Munich-based neuroethicist Marcello Ienca told me. “To my knowledge, they are the only company that is currently planning clinical trials for implantable medical neural interfaces while making public statements about future nonmedical applications of neural implants for cognitive enhancement. To create a general-purpose technology, you need to create a seamless interface between humans and computers, enabling enhanced cognitive and sensory abilities. Achieving this vision may indeed require more invasive methods to achieve higher bandwidth and precision.” Watanabe believes Neuralink prioritized maximizing bandwidth because that serves Musk’s goal of creating a generalized BCI that lets us merge with AI and develop all sorts of new capacities. “That’s what Elon Musk is saying, so that’s what the company has to do,” he said. The intravascular approach didn’t seem like it could deliver as much bandwidth as the invasive approach. Staying in the blood vessels may be safer, but the downside is that you don’t have access to as many neurons. “That’s the biggest reason they did not go for this approach,” Watanabe said. “It’s rather sad.” He added that he believed Neuralink was too quick to abandon the minimally invasive approach. “We could have pushed this project forward.” For Tom Oxley, the CEO of Synchron, this raises a big question. “The question is, does a clash emerge between the short-term goal of patient-oriented clinical health outcomes and the long-term goal of AI symbiosis?” he told me. “I think the answer is probably yes.” “It matters what you’re designing for and if you have a patient problem in mind,” Oxley added. Synchron could theoretically build toward increasing bandwidth by miniaturizing its tech and going into deeper branches of the blood vessels; research shows this is viable. “But,” he said, “we chose a point at which we think we have enough signal to solve a problem for a patient.” Ben Rapoport, a neurosurgeon who left Neuralink to found Precision Neuroscience, emphasized that any time you’ve got electrodes penetrating the brain, you’re doing some damage to brain tissue. And that’s unnecessary if your goal is helping paralyzed patients. “I don’t think that tradeoff is required for the kind of neuroprosthetic function that we need to restore speech and motor function to patients with stroke and spinal cord injury,” Rapoport told me. “One of our guiding philosophies is that building a high-fidelity brain-computer interface system can be accomplished without damaging the brain.” To prove that you don’t need Muskian invasiveness to achieve high bandwidth, Precision has designed a thin film that coats the surface of the brain with 1,024 electrodes — the same number of electrodes in Neuralink’s implant — that deliver signals similar to Neuralink’s. The film has to be inserted through a slit in the skull, but the advantage is that it sits on the brain’s surface without penetrating it. Rapoport calls this the “Goldilocks solution,” and it’s already been implanted in a handful of patients, recording their brain activity at high resolution. “It’s key to do a very, very safe procedure that doesn’t damage the brain and that is minimally invasive in nature,” Rapoport said. “And furthermore, that as we scale up the bandwidth of the system, the risk to the patient should not increase.” This makes sense if your most cherished ambition is to help patients improve their lives as much as possible without courting undue risk. But Musk, we know, has other ambitions. “What Neuralink doesn’t seem to be very interested in is that while a more invasive approach might offer advantages in terms of bandwidth, it raises greater ethical and safety concerns,” Ienca told me. “At least, I haven’t heard any public statement in which they indicate how they intend to address the greater privacy, safety, and mental integrity risks generated by their approach. This is strange because according to international research ethics guidelines it wouldn’t be ethical to use a more invasive technology if the same performance can be achieved using less invasive methods.” More invasive methods, by their nature, can do real damage to the brain — as Neuralink’s experiments on animals have shown.

   Some Neuralink employees have come forward to speak on behalf of the pigs and monkeys used in the company’s experiments, saying they suffered and died at higher rates than necessary because the company was rushing and botching surgeries. Musk, they alleged, was pushing the staff to get FDA approval quickly after he’d repeatedly predicted the company would soon start human trials.  One example of a grisly error: In 2021, Neuralink implanted 25 out of 60 pigs with devices that were the wrong size. Afterward, the company killed all the affected pigs. Staff told Reuters that the mistake could have been averted if they’d had more time to prepare. Veterinary reports indicate that Neuralink’s monkeys also suffered gruesome fates. In one monkey, a bit of the device “broke off” during implantation in the brain. The monkey scratched and yanked until part of the device was dislodged, and infections took hold. Another monkey developed bleeding in her brain, with the implant leaving parts of her cortex “tattered.” Both animals were euthanized.	 Last December, the US Department of Agriculture’s Office of Inspector General launched an investigation into possible animal welfare violations at Neuralink. The company is also facing a probe from the Department of Transportation over worries that implants removed from monkeys’ brains may have been packaged and moved unsafely, potentially exposing people to pathogens. “Past animal experiments [at Neuralink] revealed serious safety concerns stemming from the product’s invasiveness and rushed, sloppy actions by company employees,” said the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a nonprofit that opposes animal testing, in a May statement. “As such, the public should continue to be skeptical of the safety and functionality of any device produced by Neuralink.”  Nevertheless, the FDA has cleared the company to begin human trials.  “The company has provided sufficient information to support the approval of its IDE [investigational device exemption] application to begin human trials under the criteria and requirements of the IDE approval,” the FDA said in a statement to Vox, adding, “The agency’s focus for determining approval of an IDE is based on assessing the safety profile for potential subjects, ensuring risks are appropriately minimized and communicated to subjects, and ensuring the potential for benefit, including the value of the knowledge to be gained, outweighs the risk.” Beyond what the surgeries will mean for the individuals who get recruited for Neuralink’s trials, there are ethical concerns about what BCI technology means for society more broadly. If high-bandwidth implants of the type Musk is pursuing really do allow unprecedented access to what’s happening in people’s brains, that could make dystopian possibilities more likely. Some neuroethicists argue that the potential for misuse is so great that we need revamped human rights laws to protect us before we move forward. For one thing, our brains are the final privacy frontier. They’re the seat of our personal identity and our most intimate thoughts. If those precious three pounds of goo in our craniums aren’t ours to control, what is? In China, the government is already mining data from some workers’ brains by having them wear caps that scan their brainwaves for emotional states. In the US, the military is looking into neurotechnologies to make soldiers more fit for duty — more alert, for instance.  And some police departments around the world have been exploring “brain fingerprinting” technology, which analyzes automatic responses that occur in our brains when we encounter stimuli we recognize. (The idea is that this could enable police to interrogate a suspect’s brain; their brain responses would be more negative for faces or phrases they don’t recognize than for faces or phrases they do recognize.) Brain fingerprinting tech is scientifically questionable, yet India’s police have used it since 2003, Singapore’s police bought it in 2013, and the Florida state police signed a contract to use it in 2014.

   Imagine a scenario where your government uses BCIs for surveillance or interrogations. The right to not self-incriminate — enshrined in the US Constitution — could become meaningless in a world where the authorities are empowered to eavesdrop on your mental state without your consent.  Experts also worry that devices like those being built by Neuralink may be vulnerable to hacking. What happens if you’re using one of them and a malicious actor intercepts the Bluetooth connection, changing the signals that go to your brain to make you more depressed, say, or more compliant? Neuroethicists refer to that as brainjacking. “This is still hypothetical, but the possibility has been demonstrated in proof-of-concept studies,” Ienca told me in 2019. “A hack like this wouldn’t require that much technological sophistication.” Finally, consider how your psychological continuity or fundamental sense of self could be disrupted by the imposition of a BCI — or by its removal. In one study, an epileptic woman who’d been given a BCI came to feel such a radical symbiosis with it that, she said, “It became me.” Then the company that implanted the device in her brain went bankrupt and she was forced to have it removed. She cried, saying, “I lost myself.” To ward off the risk of a hypothetical all-powerful AI in the future, Musk wants to create a symbiosis between your brain and machines. But the symbiosis generates its own very real risks — and they are upon us now.  Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

By  Joshua Kim  You have /5 articles left.Sign up for a free account or log in. Simon & Schuster Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson Published in September 2023 Last November, I wrote “8 Reasons Why Elon Musk Should Be Your University’s Next President.” I intended that piece as satire. Not every reader got the joke. The opening lines of that 2022 post read, “The brilliant and inspiring leadership that Elon Musk has brought to Twitter since purchasing the company for $44 billion is ample evidence (as if we needed more) that universities should be run more like companies. “What better way to break through the inefficiencies and outdated thinking of traditional academic leadership than to not only adopt Musk’s operational style as our own but to recruit Musk as the next president of our university?” Having just finished reading Walter Isaacson’s compelling, even-handed and expertly crafted biography, I’ve been thinking more about what Musk’s leadership style tells us about academic culture. Isaacson seems to have had full access to Musk, his employees, ex-wives and family members. The biographer shadowed Musk for a couple of years and was in the room as the Twitter acquisition debacle unfolded.  At the heart of the Elon Musk story, and where I think there may be lessons for universities and university leaders, is a question. Can decent humans change the world? Isaacson’s answer is mostly no. What is clear from Musk’s life, at least so far, is that:  When I say immensely valuable, I mainly refer to his role in shifting the entire automotive ecosystem to electric. Say what you want about the damage that Musk has done to Twitter or the messiness of his personal life (all deeply recounted in Isaacson’s biography); Tesla, under Musk’s leadership, has changed the electric vehicle game.  Electric vehicles would have arrived eventually, but their entrance would have been years later if it were not for Tesla. And Tesla would not be where it is today without Musk’s willingness to take risks and push those around him to work insane hours. Reading Isaacson’s biography has also enhanced my interest in following SpaceX. Before reading the book, I was turned off by billionaires building rockets. What the book makes clear, however, is that despite Musk’s long-term Mars goals (or fantasies, as Mars is a terrible planet for humans), SpaceX is very much a viable—and maybe even essential—business. In the decades when NASA became frozen and the U.S. lost its ability to send satellites and people to orbit, SpaceX innovated to make rockets cheaper (and reusable), safer and more reliable.  The most interesting higher ed lens regarding Musk’s leadership style is not Tesla or SpaceX but Twitter. While the Twitter story may not be over, it is hard to argue with the conclusion that Musk’s ownership has done significant damage to the platform. The leadership style that enabled the creation of a world-changing electric car company and the (seemingly successful) privatization of orbital rockets has been a disaster at the media and tech company that was Twitter. (Or X, or whatever it calls itself.) Thankfully, it is unlikely that a new university president who emulates the leadership style of Elon Musk could do as much damage to their institution as Musk has done to Twitter. Nonprofit universities are built (although not exclusively) on systems of distributed leadership. Power is diffused at colleges and universities, meaning top academic leaders must lead (at least partly) through coalition building and persuasion.  No president could as easily fire 80 percent of the faculty and staff within months of taking the role as Musk did at Twitter following his acquisition. But look at things the other way. In requiring that anyone who works at Twitter be “hard-core,” Musk has been able to remake the company’s organization and culture. The site still runs, even with only 20 percent of the staff.  Pre-Musk, Twitter’s culture would have been familiar to a university employee. There was an ethos of tolerance and support, with corporate policies promoting diversity, equity and employee well-being. Under Musk, all that disappeared. An Elon Musk–run university, or a university run by someone adopting Musk’s style and methods, might create dramatically favorable outcomes. Costs could be slashed, potentially allowing credentials to be offered at significantly lower prices.  Imagining a university going through a similar transformation as Twitter under a leader like Musk is almost unimaginable. The Musk leadership playbook would kill the academic culture and likely force almost everyone working at the university to leave.  What would change in a Musk-like university? The question, however, is not if a Musk-type leader will come to higher education but when.  We are likely at a point where there is enough societal dissatisfaction with the rising costs and stagnant outcomes of postsecondary education that someone, somewhere, will take an Elon Musk–like approach to transforming a university.  Likely, it will happen somewhere in Florida. (Maybe it already is.) What are you reading?  U.S. Endowments, status and history of postsecondary economics.

Elon Musk's X is testing an annual fee for unverified accounts ... After Elon Musk hinted last month that X could start charging all users, the ...","Markets   
Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News          After Elon Musk hinted last month that X could start charging all users, the company (formerly known as Twitter) announced a test of such a system.  
   
      X said in a post on Tuesday that it is testing a new program called “Not a Bot” in which new users in New Zealand and the Philippines will be required to sign up for a $1 annual subscription to post and interact with other posts.  
   
      The test will apply only to new web accounts, and the fee will be waived if users sign up for X’s $3.99 per month premium subscription service. New users in the testing region who opt out of premium and the annual subscription will only be able to read posts, watch videos and follow accounts — but not interact on the platform. Existing users will not be affected as part of the test. 
   
      The company said in the post that the program is meant to “bolster our already successful efforts to reduce spam, manipulation of our platform and bot activity, while balancing platform accessibility with the small fee amount,” adding that the fee is not meant to be a profit driver.  
   
      The test comes after Musk has encouraged users to sign up for X Premium as a way of reducing spam and scam activity on the platform, suggesting that requiring credit card payments helps verify a user’s identity and creates a higher barrier to entry for inauthentic accounts. As an added incentive, premium users receive a blue checkmark, have their posts boosted by the platform’s algorithm and are eligible to receive payments as part of X’s new ad revenue share program.  
   
      It also comes after Musk made a vague statement in a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month suggesting he could start charging all users. He said the company is “moving to have a small monthly payment for use of the X system” because it is “the only way I can think of to combat vast armies of bots.” 
   
      Experts, however, have said that many bad actors are more than willing and able to pay up for inauthentic accounts on the platform. In theory, a person could also pay to verify an account and then allow a computer to run it, thus effectively creating an automated (or “bot”) verified account. 
   
      X has come under fire in the past week over false and misleading claims that have been widely shared on the platform related to the Israel-Hamas war. The European Commission last week formally opened an investigation into X after a previous warning about disinformation and illegal content on its platform linked to the conflict.  
   
      X says it has removed “hundreds of Hamas-affiliated accounts,” taken down thousands of posts since the attack on Israel by Hamas and ramped up Community Notes, its program that allows users to fact check other users’ posts. “X is… addressing identified fake and manipulated content during this constantly evolving and shifting crisis,” X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a letter to EU Commissioner Thiery Breton last week.

https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-considering-taking-twitter-x-out-of-europe-dsa-2023-10,"Elon Musk Considers Taking X, Formerly Twitter, Out of Europe",20231001,"Oct 18, 2023 ... As X, formerly Twitter, faces increased scrutiny in the EU and use falls, Elon Musk has floated drastic action.","Jump to        In recent weeks Elon Musk has suggested X could stop being accessible in Europe to avoid new regulation enacted by the European Commission. Musk has become increasingly frustrated with having to comply with the Digital Services Act, a person familiar with the company said. The person added that the Tesla billionaire, who acquired Twitter a year ago for $44 billion and rebranded it to X, had discussed simply removing the app's availability in the region or blocking users in the European Union from accessing it. This would be similar to the way Meta is blocking people in Europe from using its new app, Threads. The DSA took effect in August and requires large online platforms such as X to have effective and transparent systems in place for the moderation and removal of false, misleading, and harmful information. With a wave of misinformation regarding the Israel-Hamas war quickly going viral on X, the platform is probably already in violation of the DSA. The EU commissioner Thierry Breton said last week that the European Commission was officially ""investigating X's compliance"" with the new law and had formally requested detailed information from the platform on its actions to mitigate and remove harmful or toxic information. Cash-strapped X could face a fine if it's found in violation of the DSA. The commission can impose ""periodic penalty payments"" of up to 6% of a company's global revenue. Musk has fired most of X's trust-and-safety team, which was once hundreds of people tasked with moderating and overseeing content on the platform. This is not the first time Musk has floated the idea of drastically limiting the app's reach. Almost immediately after acquiring the company, he suggested as a cost-cutting measure limiting X's operations to only the US, two other people familiar with the company said. ""That's part of the reason he gutted international teams the first chance he got,"" one of the people familiar said, referring to some of the thousands of employees Musk had laid off or fired since taking over the company. A winnowing down of X's international presence came up again earlier this year when Musk decided to close nearly all of the company's roughly two dozen global offices, including most in Europe and India, as well as those in Australia, Africa, and South Korea. At the time, Musk suggested the platform, then still known as Twitter, should shift to operating only in the countries where it was most popular, so the US, the UK, and Japan. Musk and a representative for X did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The platform's press line has an automatic reply stating, ""Busy now, please check back later."" After publication, Musk described Insider's report as ""utterly false"" in a post on X, saying ""They are not a real publication."" A representative of the European Commission also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Though Musk has yet to pull X out of any country, one of the people said that essentially no employees remained in Europe, as offices in Paris, Madrid, and Berlin had closed. Dublin, however, remains open. London, too, with the UK no longer being part of the EU and proposing separate obligations for large platforms. Europe accounts for about 9% of X's global monthly active-user base, data from Apptopia indicates, though daily use has dropped significantly in the past three months, falling between 10% and 40% throughout the region. Downloads and use are down in almost every country the app operates in. X employees have come to understand that any idea from Musk, no matter how illogical it may seem, can quickly become a reality. Charging people to use the platform was also one of his earliest ideas and is now being rolled out. And Musk is known to be mercurial and reactive. One of the people familiar with the company said that while Musk had met at least twice this year with Breton about what X needed to do to comply with the DSA, he'd lost patience with the situation. On X, Musk seemed to reply sarcastically to a post from Breton on X's DSA compliance and insisted he didn't understand what was being asked of him. He then said he wouldn't engage in ""backroom deals."" ""He's very quick to drop the hammer on anyone who he doesn't like,"" one of the people familiar said, ""or who says something that he views as challenging him.""

	These waters are getting choppy. 
	On the same day in mid-September that Warner Bros. dropped the trailer for its $215 million “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” embarrassing documents from the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial surfaced on Reddit, creating a new headache for the studio behind the film. 
	Depp fans paid the court fees for the release of documents from Heard’s therapist, Dr. Dawn Hughes. The raw notes, scribbled on a legal pad, were part of last year’s high-profile trial in which Depp largely prevailed. They describe a hostile “Aquaman” set where an allegedly intoxicated Jason Momoa dressed like Depp and pushed to have Heard booted from the role of aquatic superhero Mera. 	        	“Jason said he wanted me fired,” the notes say. “Jason drunk — late on set. Dressing like Johnny. Has all the rings too.” 
	A rep for Momoa declined comment, but a DC spokesperson pushed back on Heard’s characterization, saying, “Jason Momoa conducted himself in a professional manner at all times on the set of ‘Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.’” Others echoed that sentiment. “Jason works his ass off, likes to have a beer once in a while like everyone, but doesn’t show up drunk to set,” says an insider who was on the London set in 2021, adding that the two stars got along and were seen joking together. “And he isn’t dressing like Johnny Depp. He has always dressed in that bohemian style.”  
	Heard declined comment, but a source close to the actress confirmed that the notes refer to the “Aquaman 2” set and reflect a session from Dec. 27, 2021. Another source close to the actress says her lawyers fought the release of the therapy notes, which had been subpoenaed by Depp’s attorneys during discovery. 
	Momoa wasn’t the only “Aquaman” principal to land in the crosshairs. The therapy session also painted a picture of Heard feeling unsupported by the film’s director, James Wan, and treated like a pariah because of her high-profile legal battle with her ex-husband. 
	“He raised his voice @ me — ‘I can’t even post about Aquaman’ — made it like it was my fault – I said ‘I’m sorry,’” say Hughes’ notes in reference to Wan. “Nobody could take selfies with me on set given blackout.” 
	Wan declined comment. The DC spokesperson says, “James is known for treating members of his cast and crew with the utmost respect and for fostering a positive, collaborative environment on set — the ‘Aquaman’ films were no exception.” 	      	And yet Heard was nearly fired, sources on both sides tell Variety. Following “Aquaman’s” release in 2018, the studio and Wan decided to drop the actress from the sequel due to her lack of chemistry with Momoa and sent a letter to her attorney, Karl Austen, informing him of its decision. (Former DC Films boss Walter Hamada testified in the defamation trial about the “issue of chemistry.”) Those sources underscore that the move to bounce Heard was unrelated to Depp and took place before he filed suit against the actress in 2019. Likewise, Momoa was not involved in the decision-making. But another source pushed back on the lack-of-chemistry narrative, noting that Heard did a chemistry test with Momoa before landing the role of Mera and beat out two other actresses who did a similar chemistry test, including Abbey Lee. 
	Ultimately, the studio never pulled the trigger on firing Heard because her former boyfriend, Elon Musk, had one of his litigators send a “scorched-earth letter to Warner Bros. threatening to burn the house down” if the actress wasn’t brought back for a sequel, says a source familiar with the behind-the-scenes battle. Warner Bros. caved and moved forward with Heard. (Musk did not respond to a request for comment.) 
	The drama is being rehashed at a time when DC Entertainment toppers James Gunn and Peter Safran are poised to close the book on the previous regime’s superhero slate with the Dec. 20 release of “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.” Since Warner Bros. chiefs Pam Abdy and Mike De Luca joined the studio in June 2022, followed by Gunn and Safran’s entrance four months later, the four have been saddled with DC duds they inherited, including this year’s “The Flash” ($271 million worldwide) and “Blue Beetle” ($128 million worldwide). 
	Still, the “Aquaman” sequel held promise considering that the character’s first outing earned $1.15 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing DC movie ever. But sources say the sequel has endured challenges outside of the Heard saga and was testing in the 60s before being recut in the summer of 2022. Despite the overhaul, the film continued to test in the 60s, prompting a new cut. “The movie is like this echo of regimes,” says one insider. “It’s the last remnant of the Snyderverse, and no one really wants to take ownership of it.” Reshoots took place right up until this year’s WGA strike in May. The on-set source disputes the idea that “Aquaman 2” is troubled, noting that the film was on time, under budget and needed only about a week of reshoots. 
	Like “Flash,” “Aquaman” can’t shake its lame duck trappings, with the DC universe getting overhauled under new leadership, marking Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav’s top priority. 
	In fact, none of the stars cast by Zack Snyder for 2016’s “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” and 2017’s “Justice League” — including Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller and Momoa — will reprise their roles in the new DC universe in character. Momoa may return, just not as Aquaman. Sources say the actor has engaged in talks to play Lobo, either in the 2025 reboot “Superman: Legacy,” written and directed by Gunn, or in a standalone film. In a confusing twist, Viola Davis, who played Amanda Waller in both of the recent “Suicide Squad” movies, will remain as that character in the Gunn-Safran DC universe in next year’s Max series “Waller” and possibly in the new “Superman” tentpole. Another outlier is Gunn’s Max series “Peacemaker,” which will be back for a second season with John Cena in the lead. 	      	Meanwhile, there has been some confusion on the series front about who is the ultimate gatekeeper. Unlike the Marvel-Disney relationship in which Marvel controls the creative process and Disney+ merely releases the content, Max is creatively involved with the DC slate. Gunn and Safran don’t enjoy the same autonomy as Marvel’s Kevin Feige. (A Max source says the collaboration between the DC team and Max executives Sarah Aubrey and Casey Bloys has been seamless, including on the upcoming series “The Penguin,” which was forced to shut down production after the WGA strike began but is expected resume shooting as soon as the SAG-AFTRA strike ends.) 
	Regardless, some on the lot are convinced that another company, most likely Universal, will buy Warner Bros. within two years, making recent DC subplots and upheavals feel quaint. 
	“The bottom line is they need to get DC to work whether Zaslav owns it, whether Brian Roberts owns it, whether somebody else owns it,” says LightShed’s Rich Greenfield, a Wall Street analyst and venture capitalist. 
	In the runup to the “Aquaman” sequel, Warner Bros. will outwardly back the film and hope for a China release like its “Barbie,” “The Flash” and “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” received. After all, the first “Aquaman” earned nearly $300 million in China alone. But those types of China numbers are a thing of the past. Neither “Barbie” nor “The Flash” landed anything close to “Aquaman’s” Middle Kingdom haul from 2018, earning $35.1 million and $25.9 million there, respectively. 
	For now, neither Momoa nor Heard will be promoting the film given the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike. But if the strike ends soon, now that the WGA has come to terms, the stars will be junketing, making it difficult for Warner Bros. and Wan to avoid Heard’s accusations that her role was significantly cut. At least two Heard scenes were cut from “Aquaman 2” — an action sequence that found Mera fighting Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and a love scene with Momoa — according to individuals familiar with the production. Other evidence of friction is hiding in plain sight. This summer, Momoa unfollowed Heard on Instagram. One source says he even blocked Heard from following him. 
	Turmoil aside, the sequel might just work at the box office. The first “Aquaman” also was ho-hum in early testing and found its footing in postproduction. A studio source says “Aquaman 2” is following a similar trajectory. Early tracking shows strong interest and puts the film’s opening on par with the first “Aquaman.” 
	“Everybody’s down on DC, but there is a chance, especially with the limited competition during the holiday season, that ‘Aquaman’ could still play like gangbusters because of lack of product,” says Jeff Bock, a box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations. “Sometimes the right film at the right time is all you need.” The Business of Entertainment"

These firings represent the latest example of the misinformation and hostile environment Musk has fostered on X's platform since purchasing the company.“As you know, election integrity teams are critical to the operations of any social media company. Such staff are integral in protecting users from election misinformation, interference, and intentional manipulation on digital platforms. Combatting these threats is particularly important on X, formerly known as Twitter, as millions of Americans use the platform to obtain critical news and election information,” the Members wrote.“The layoffs made in recent days on X’s election integrity team leave us with grave concerns about the likely impact on our constituents and our democracy. We were also troubled to learn that X recently disabled a feature that allows users to report political posts that they consider misleading. In doing so, X has left users defenseless against the spread of election misinformation,” the Members continued.Specifically the Members’ letter calls for responses to six fundamental questions: The full text of the Members’ letter to Elon Musk can be found HERE and below: Dear Elon Musk, We write as concerned Members of Congress regarding recent reports that half of X’s election integrity team was laid off in the past week. We are looking for clarity on the issue and strongly urge you to maintain robust measures to prevent further spread of election misinformation. As you know, election integrity teams are critical to the operations of any social media company. Such staff are integral in protecting users from election misinformation, interference, and intentional manipulation on digital platforms. Combatting these threats is particularly important on X, formerly known as Twitter, as millions of Americans use the platform to obtain critical news and election information. The layoffs made in recent days on X’s election integrity team leave us with grave concerns about the likely impact on our constituents and our democracy. We were also troubled to learn that X recently disabled a feature that allows users to report political posts that they consider misleading. In doing so, X has left users defenseless against the spread of election misinformation. This has not been our first concern about the hostile environment you have created on X’s platform since you took over. For instance, misinformation and hate speech has only increased on your platform since you assumed the role. We have written to you before regarding the extreme spike in the number of tweets that include slurs, the level of engagement with these tweets, and the popularity of spreading harmful rhetoric. New research has also emerged since our previous letters that further illustrates the proliferation of hate and misinformation on your platform. We understand that there is a monetary gain to be made by allowing bad actors on your platform. From reinstating accounts that were espousing hate, it was estimated that X could generate up to $19 million a year in advertising revenue. The latest report from the Anti-Defamation League and the Tech Transparency Project explains the extent to which X runs ads on content associated with white supremacists and other bad actors likely to spread election misinformation. However, revenue for your platform should not come at the cost of the safety of users. Unfortunately, our concern for our constituents has been met with continuous hostility from you and your team. You have personally directed a number of hostile tweets at accounts of Members of Congress, which have included statistics without evidence, unclear graphs, and generally antagonistic comments. However, we continue to write to you in hopes of gaining insight into your recent decisions and a better understanding of the internal mechanisms X is using to combat misinformation. As we approach another pivotal election, it is imperative that you and your leadership take election integrity seriously and prioritize a robust election integrity team. Thus, we are seeking the following information about your platform’s plans for election integrity and the capability of your workforce to implement and enforce your policies. We look forward to hearing your responses. ###"

X is shrinking meaningfully under Elon Musk. Since Musk bought Twitter in October 2022, it's lost approximately 13 percent of its app's daily ...","This article is from Big Technology, a newsletter by Alex Kantrowitz. X is shrinking meaningfully under Elon Musk. Since Musk bought Twitter in October 2022, it’s lost approximately 13 percent of its app’s daily active users, according to new data from mobile research firm Apptopia (that I was first to report last week on Big Technology), and its rebrand as X only accelerated the decline. Meta’s Twitter clone Threads, meanwhile, isn’t taking advantage of its rival’s troubles, with stagnant engagement and little meaningful migration. Apptopia pulls its data from more than 100,000 apps on iOS and Android, along with publicly available sources. Its new data should put to rest the countervailing narratives over Musk’s management of X. Under his stewardship, X’s daily user base has declined from an estimated 140 million app users to 121 million, Apptopia says, with a widening gap between people who check it daily versus monthly. X’s remaining daily users are engaged similarly as before. But the pool is shrinking. Under Musk, X’s key use case has degraded considerably. The app built its relevance by delivering in-the-moment updates on key news events from firsthand sources and reporters. But Musk ditched this utility as he’s changed its main news feed algorithm; these days it privileges ChatGPT influencers, edgelords, and his business and culture-war confidants. Musk also overhauled verification into a paid feature, putting a larger burden on the user to sort through who might be close to a story and who might simply be LARPing as a source close to the news. It’s one reason the app is offering few reasons for many users to linger. Beyond those UI changes, Musk’s July rebrand of Twitter to X—discarding a troubled but ubiquitous brand—caused the company serious harm. In both August and September, X lost more than 5 percent of its daily users month over month. This all but negated any positive momentum Musk generated during the takeover. “After the sudden rebrand, there was a ~2,000% spike in negative daily app reviews,” Adam Blacker, Apptopia’s director of content and communications, told me. “The keywords ‘logo’ and ‘blue bird’ appeared as top 10 keywords left in user reviews, each with negative sentiments attached to them.” The data contradicts X CEO Linda Yaccarino’s claim in July that X usage is at an all-time high, though Musk might’ve been correct with a similar statement about record user growth in November 2022. Those users didn’t stick around, however. X’s remaining daily users are spending a consistent amount of time on the app, signaling it does have staying power among a dedicated core. The average user spends around 15 minutes on the app per day, per Apptopia. Asked to comment, X autoreplied, “busy now, please check back later.” X’s usage continues to be top-heavy, according to the data. Power users—the top 10 percent—account for 72 percent of all time spent on the app, slightly more than the 70 percent they spent inside X in October 2022. This indicates that either a new group of power users replaced those who left or that power users and casual users left in consistent numbers. Meta’s July launch of Threads was seen as a potential Twitter killer by some, but the data show it remains a dud. Threads has climbed the App Store lately, but after commanding more than 20 minutes of daily use from X users at launch, it’s fallen to below five minutes from that group today. Apptopia believes that only about 10 percent of X users have ever tried Threads. Mark Zuckerberg wants to get Threads to 1 billion users, but even returning to 100 million seems like a stretch. Threads has shied away from news, discarding a surefire method to gain engagement. Its algorithm regularly surfaces posts from hours, or days, earlier, which means it’s not suited to fast-moving news events. Speeding the app up would likely improve engagement over time, but Meta is reluctant to jump back into news after its debacles in the 2010s. Life is simpler without it. Musk is starting to charge some users $1 for X’s essential functions, which could open a new window for a competitor. But the decline of X usage without a replacement seems to confirm that the product—or something like it—simply does not appeal to the masses. With options like TikTok for entertainment and online publishers for news, being in the “room” as operatives and partisans yell at each other over breaking information isn’t the draw many imagined. One year after walking into Twitter HQ , Musk is learning this firsthand. Slate is published by The Slate

To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Vittoria Elliott David Gilbert Community Notes, the crowdsourced fact-checking program launched a year ago to tackle disinformation on X (formerly Twitter), has flown under the radar for much of its existence. But in the past week it has been heralded by Elon Musk and X CEO Linda Yaccarino as a key tool in tackling the toxic deluge of disinformation that has flooded social media, and in particular X, during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. On Saturday, the company wrote on its own platform that “notes across the platform are now being seen tens of millions of times per day, generating north of 85 million impressions in the last week.” It added that thousands of new contributors had been enrolled in the system. However, a WIRED investigation found that Community Notes appears to be not functioning as designed, may be vulnerable to coordinated manipulation by outside groups, and lacks transparency about how notes are approved. Sources also claim that it is filled with in-fighting and disinformation, and there appears to be no real oversight from the company itself. “I understand why they do it, but it doesn't do anything like what they say it does,” one Community Notes contributor tells WIRED. “It is prone to manipulation, and it is far too slow and cumbersome. It serves no purpose as far as I can see. I think it's probably making the disinformation worse, to be honest.” This contributor, who was granted anonymity for this story because of concerns about retaliation from Musk or his supporters, should know about platform manipulation, because he is one of those engaging in it. He is one member of a group of about 25 Community Notes contributors who actively coordinate on a daily basis in order to upvote or downvote particular notes. He is a member of the North Atlantic Fella Organization (NAFO), a decentralized online volunteer movement that emerged following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uses humor to counter Russian disinformation and propaganda while raising funds in support of Ukraine. “We have a group so we can coordinate who writes what Community Notes, and if you write one, you can coordinate so you get one voted as helpful, and there's no validation on any of that,” the contributor says. The contributor claims that Russian embassies have engaged in similar tactics and alleges that they “will downvote anything that's anti-Russian.” A WIRED review of unpublished notes accompanying contested Russian embassy posts written by NAFO members shows they have all been repeatedly downvoted. Angela Watercutter Andy Greenberg Gregory Barber Garrett M. Graff A contributor based in the southern hemisphere tells WIRED that he has two accounts on X, and he alleges that both of them have been approved for access to the Community Notes system—evidence that the program may be vulnerable to even broader manipulation, just as Kremlin trolls were able to operate multiple Twitter accounts impersonating US citizens and influence the 2016 election. Community Notes began life as Birdwatch, first announced in October 2020 before going live in a pilot project in January 2021, weeks after Donald Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol. Envisioned as a way of harnessing the power of the crowd to debunk misinformation in near real time, Birdwatch was never fully embraced by the company, which was criticized in March last year, soon after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, for failing to roll it out more broadly. At the time, there was trepidation within the company about how effective the tool would be at controlling the quality of information on the platform, Yoel Roth, Twitter's former head of Trust and Safety, tells WIRED. “There was a belief amongst the Trust and Safety team that people would not do uncompensated labor at scale, and that the things that would attract attention in a Birdwatch format didn't necessarily correspond with the harmful things that constituted violations of policies,” says Roth. This truth was later borne out, at least in part. A study presented at a conference in April 2022 by researchers at MIT found that Birdwatch users were much more likely to fact-check posts expressing political views that differ from their own. David Rand, the study’s lead researcher and a professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, says that while around 80 percent of the tweets that users chose to annotate were, in fact, misleading, users overwhelmingly tended to prioritize political content. Users were also likely to flag a piece of content based on whether it seemed “reasonable.” It is unclear whether these users had the knowledge and skills to debunk misinformation or offer alternative, correct information. “In a situation like what is happening in Israel and Gaza right now, where there's a massive amount of unknowns, that gut-check of ‘Does this seem reasonable?’ is not great. Even professional journalists, as I understand it, are having a lot of trouble understanding what's true and what's not true,” says Rand. With such a fast-moving and volatile situation, “what I expect the crowd to produce is a lot of noise,” he says. Angela Watercutter Andy Greenberg Gregory Barber Garrett M. Graff Almost immediately after Musk took control of the company in late October 2022, he renamed Birdwatch “Community Notes,” claiming that the system had “incredible potential for improving information accuracy.” In the months that followed, X systematically eradicated almost all of the teams and individuals overseeing content moderation and trust and safety at the company, putting even greater emphasis on the role of Community Notes. Joe Benarroch, head of business operations at X, tells WIRED that the company has contributors across 44 countries, and while he would not give an exact number, he noted that more than 10,000 people had joined the program in the past week. Alongside contributors who volunteer for the program, some contributors are invited by X itself, WIRED has learned, according to one contributor we spoke to and a search of X, where contributors say X invited them to join. Benarroch did not address whether there is any form of moderation for Community Notes. And while Benarroch says “Community Notes were designed to tackle misinformation on X,” Roth says their original intention was not to perform that task alone. “The intention of Birdwatch was always to be a complement to, rather than a replacement for, Twitter's other misinformation methods,” says Roth. “The company fired the entire curation team, without whom misinformation enforcement can't operate, even if the policies are still on the books,” he says, referring to the former employees who would create the collections of tweets for corrections or produce the labels to let users know if something was misinformative. “Community Notes is an imperfect replacement for Trust and Safety staff,” says one former Twitter Trust and Safety employee who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “You can’t just outsource that work to the community.” While X claims Community Notes is having a significant impact on tackling disinformation on the platform, the notes system itself can also spread disinformation. Last week WIRED revealed that a note appended to a post from Donald Trump Jr. wrongly claimed a video he posted about the Hamas attack on Israel was fake. The original note has since been replaced with one citing WIRED’s report. Many notes written by contributors are never seen by the public. A WIRED examination of these unpublished notes shows that just like the main X platform, the Community Notes community is similarly riven by in-fighting and misinformation. Angela Watercutter Andy Greenberg Gregory Barber Garrett M. Graff On Saturday, the official Israel account on X posted a picture of what looks like a child’s bedroom with blood covering the floor. “This could be your child’s bedroom. No words,” the post reads. There is no suggestion the picture is fake, and publicly there are no notes on the post. However, in the Community Notes backend, viewed by WIRED, multiple contributors are engaging in a conspiracy-fueled back-and-forth. “Deoxygenated blood has a shade of dark red, therefore this is staged,” one contributor wrote. “Post with manipulative intent that tries to create an emotional reaction in the reader by relating words and pictures in a decontextualized way,” another writes. “There is no evidence that this picture is staged. A Wikipedia article about blood is not evidence that this is staged,” another contributor writes. “There is no evidence this photo is from the October 7th attacks,” another claims. These types of exchanges raise questions about how X approves contributors for the program, but this, along with precisely what factors are considered before each note is approved, remains unknown. X’s Benarroch did not respond to questions about how contributors are chosen. None of those approved for the system are given any training, according to all contributors WIRED spoke to, and the only limitation placed on the contributors initially is an inability to write new notes until they have rated a number of other notes first. One contributor claims this approval process can take fewer than six hours. In order for notes to become attached to a post publicly, they need to be approved as “helpful” by a certain number of contributors, though how many is unclear. X describes “helpful” notes as ones that get “enough contributors from different perspectives.” Benarroch did not say how X evaluates a user’s political leanings. However, the system at least previously employed a technique known as bridge-based ranking to favor notes that receive positive interactions from users estimated to hold differing viewpoints. Still, how this works is not clear to at least some Community Notes contributors.  “I don't see any mechanism by which they can know what perspective people hold,” Anna, a UK-based former journalist whom X invited to become a Community Notes contributor, tells WIRED. “I really don't see how that would work, to be honest, because new topics come up that one could not possibly have been rated on.” Anna asked only to be identified by her first name for fear of backlash from other X users. Angela Watercutter Andy Greenberg Gregory Barber Garrett M. Graff For all the notes that do become public, there are many more that remain unseen, either because they are deemed unhelpful, or in the majority of cases reviewed by WIRED, they simply didn’t get enough votes from other contributors. One contributor tells WIRED that 503 notes he had rated in the last week remained in limbo because not enough people had voted on them. “I think one of the issues with Community Notes at its core, it's not really scalable for the amount of media that's being consumed or posted in any given day,” the contributor, who is known online as Investigator515, tells WIRED. They asked to only be identified by their handle because of fears of damage to their professional reputation. All of the contributors who spoke to WIRED feel that Community Notes is not up to the task of policing the platform for misinformation, and none of them believed that the program would improve at all in the coming months if it remains in its current form. “It's much harder to deal with misinformation when there isn't the top-down moderation that Twitter used to have, because accounts willfully spreading misinformation would get suspended before they could really do a lot of harm,” the longtime contributor says. “So a reliance on Community Notes is not good. It's not a replacement for proper content moderation.” Updated at 7:10 pm ET, October 17, 2023, to add further context about how the Community Notes system may gauge the viewpoint diversity of contributors. 📨 Make the most of chatbots with our AI Unlocked newsletter Taylor Swift, Star Wars, Stranger Things, and Deadpool have one man in common Generative AI is playing a surprising role in Israel-Hamas disinformation The new era of social media looks as bad for privacy as the last one Johnny Cash’s Taylor Swift cover predicts the boring future of AI music Your internet browser does not belong to you 🔌 Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters, power banks, and USB hubs Reece Rogers Matt Burgess Lily Hay Newman David Gilbert Deidre Olsen Dell Cameron Lily Hay Newman Garrett M.

Elon Musk is pictured in May in Paris. A California man says he was harassed after Musk amplified posts on X that falsely said he was involved in a confrontation between far-right protesters. Elon Musk, the owner of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, is being sued by a recent college graduate who says Musk falsely accused him of being affiliated with a neo-Nazi group. Ben Brody, 22, is suing Musk for libel, saying Musk amplified posts on X that wrongly identified Brody as a participant in a brawl between two right-wing extremist groups during a Pride event in Portland, Ore., on June 24. ""Over the past several years, Musk has settled into a consistent pattern of making reckless false statements to the detriment of innocent third parties while fostering disinformation and denying neo-Nazi violence,"" the lawsuit alleges. It was filed Monday in the district court of Travis County, Texas. A lawyer for Musk did not respond to a request for comment. Under his ownership, conspiratorial narratives rapidly gain audiences on X. Back in June, members of the Proud Boys and the Rose City Nationalists were at the Portland event to ""vent their bigotry and intimidate Pride Night celebrants,"" the complaint says. But the groups got into a fight amongst themselves. Video of the brawl quickly went viral, and right wing social media influencers began accusing the Rose City Nationalists of being federal agents or left-wing antagonists there to influence public opinion of the groups. In the video, two Rose City Nationalists had their masks torn off. Brody was accused of being one of the unmasked men. An anonymous account tweeted screenshots of a man's face in the video, accompanied by a picture of Brody, taken from an Instagram post by his college fraternity, Alpha Epsilon Pi, which refers to itself as ""the world's Jewish college fraternity."" As a person with Jewish heritage, being accused of being a neo-Nazi ""would be utterly profane and blasphemous if it were true,"" the suit says. Musk asked in a Twitter post, ""Who were the unmasked individuals?"" to which another user copied the post accusing Brody of being a participant. ""Very odd,"" Musk responded. Brody, who lives in Los Angeles County, Calif., posted an Instagram video trying to absolve himself, as well as debit card receipts showing he was in California the day of the Portland brawl. He also contacted one of the stores he patronized that day for video footage, the complaint says. Many X users began telling Musk that it was not Brody in the video. Under another post sharing Brody's picture, Musk commented, ""Always remove their masks."" On June 27, Musk tweeted a reply in reference to the unmasked men in the video: ""Looks like one is a college student (who wants to join the govt) and another is maybe an Antifa member, but nonetheless a probable false flag situation."" ""False flag"" is a term used in military contexts, but it's also often used by conspiracists to refer to actions carried out to purposely pin the blame on another party. Musk's June 27 tweet has been viewed more than 1.2 million times. Musk's tweets remain up. He has refused to retract his accusations, the lawsuit says. ""Musk's personal endorsement of the false accusation against Ben Brody reverberated across the internet, transforming the accusation from anonymous rumor to gospel truth for many individuals, and causing others to use Musk's endorsement to justify their desire to harass Ben Brody and his family,"" the lawsuit says. ""Ben spent the following days and weeks in a cycle of panic, fear, denial, disorientation, and depression,"" it says. Brody also had trouble sleeping, panic attacks, headaches and fatigue that interfered with his daily life, the suit says. ""Ben was put through intense terror because of Musk's recklessness, and now Ben finds himself depressed, freaked out, and mentally distraught right at the crucial personal moment when he exits college and enters his career path,"" the complaint adds. Brody worries about the availability of job opportunities in the future and being confronted by conspiracy theorists. He's seeking damages of at least $1 million, a jury trial and a judgment clearing his name, the lawsuit says. ""The reality is that too many powerful people with enormous audiences are being reckless with their accusations against private people,"" the complaint says. ""The damage they cause is not easily repaired by apologies or counter-speech, no matter how persuasive."" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor"

Elon Musk, the owner of X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, has made many changes to the service since buying it last year for $44bn. He overhauled the verification system, reinstated former US President Donald Trump, gutted trust and safety teams, and installed a new CEO, former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino. The consequences of some of those actions – specifically the loss of the trust and safety teams – were particularly visible this week as X has been flooded with disinformation about the large-scale violence in Israel, becoming the latest change to the platform that has experts concerned. The online disinformation on the Israel-Hamas war has come at a time when X has stopped displaying headlines for articles shared on the platform. As of last week, the social network only shows the lead image associated with the article and the website it leads to. A day after that move, online tech news outlet Mashable reported that X stopped labelling ads, making it difficult to tell them apart from regular posts. The company’s changes will make it hard for people to keep up with news, and could alienate advertisers, hurt revenues, and drive away users, experts told Al Jazeera. “[The] erosion of trust, both from users and advertisers, coupled with the heightened risk of disinformation and misinformation, should cause worry for X’s future prospects,” said Zachary Weiner, CEO of communications agency Emerging Insider which focuses on media, publishers, and the entertainment industry. “The platform’s business model, historically reliant on ad revenues and active user engagement, is under threat.” The change in how X displays articles was not a complete surprise. In August, Fortune reported that X was working on it, and Musk later confirmed that it was “coming from me directly” in a post because it would “greatly improve the esthetics [sic].” But its rollout met widespread outrage. “I hate how Twitter (X) is removing the headline,” posted a user called ResignRachel. “Shame. No one is going to look at the posts now.” “I hate it,” declared Hannah Godfrey, another X user. The Washington Post said that the change posed a “challenge for media outlets”. “The automated display of headlines allowed users to quickly discern the nature of an article, providing context and a summary even before clicking through,” said Weiner. “With this removed, users, whether they are everyday individuals or influencers, are burdened with the responsibility of manually providing context.”       
  Other experts said that the move was part of a larger trend of social media platforms moving away from news, in general. Earlier this month, for instance, an Axios report showed that traffic to the world’s largest news websites from Facebook and X had declined significantly over the past year. “Links are the distribution tool for publishers,” Noam Bardin, the CEO and founder of Post, an X rival that focuses on news, told Al Jazeera. “[But] links to news sites take users out of the social media site, where the social media site cannot advertise.” X’s move to stop labelling ads on the platform has also annoyed members of the creator economy. “Transparency is critical,” said Ahsan Tahir in an interview with Al Jazeera, the co-founder and CEO at Walee.pk, a large digital influencer network based in Pakistan. Platforms like X need to make advertisers feel like partners, Tahir said, but X’s decision to stop labelling ads did not inspire confidence. Advertisers have reportedly fled X in the last few months. X does not disclose revenues, but Musk posted last month that there was a 60 percent drop in advertisement sales this year. As the armed group Hamas attacked Israel on Saturday, X was also flooded with misinformation about the large-scale violence in Israel, according to multiple news reports. Hundreds of verified X accounts posted old and unverified videos and images of missile attacks and military activity, including video game screenshots, and tried to pass them off as current and authentic. One verified X account made the false claim that the US was sending $8bn worth of military aid to Israel, Bloomberg reported. In the absence of a content moderation team, such posts received hundreds of thousands of views on the platform. “If brands perceive a platform as a breeding ground for misleading information or low-quality ad content, they may hesitate to invest or spend,” Weiner said. “A decline in ad quality, coupled with diminishing transparency and decreasing brand safety could lead to reduced ad revenues.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday sought to force Elon Musk to sit for a deposition as part of an ongoing investigation about his purchase of Twitter, now known as X. The SEC said Musk failed to appear for testimony as required by a May subpoena despite agreeing to show up last month at the SEC’s office in San Francisco. Musk waited until two days before the scheduled date to notify the SEC he would not appear, regulators said. They’re now seeking a court order to force Musk to comply. Musk acquired the social media site in October 2022 for roughly $44 billion.  The testimony subpoena involves an ongoing investigation by the SEC into ""potential violations of various provisions of the federal securities laws"" regarding Musk's purchase, as well as statements he made last year and SEC filings related to Twitter, the SEC said in a press release. ""[The] SEC seeks Musk’s testimony to obtain information not already in the SEC’s possession that is relevant to its legitimate and lawful investigation,"" the press release said, noting the SEC staff to date have not determined that any person or entity has violated federal securities laws.  In response to a post on X about the SEC's court order and other government investigations into his companies, Musk said a ""comprehensive overhaul of these agencies is sorely needed, along with a commission to take punitive action against those individuals who have abused their regulatory power for personal and political gain."" ""Can't wait for this to happen,"" he added. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

[+] on March 22, 2022 in Germany. (Photo by Patrick Pleul / POOL / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK PLEUL/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) One of the ideas at the heart of the discipline of supply chain management is the importance of collaboration. The discipline has done a good job of driving collaboration between sales and marketing and manufacturing, procurement, and logistics. The profession has not yet managed to integrate product development into core decisions in a meaningful way. I attended the SAP Spend Connect Live conference in Vienna, Austria last week. This user conference focused on SAP’s spend management and business network solutions. Because procurement is a major theme of the conference, I could not help but talk to the top executives of this business unit about the new Elon Musk biography. In the biography, the author - Walter Issacson - makes it clear – and this is a massive understatement – that Elon Musk is not like most other CEOs. Elon Musk is not just the CEO of Tesla, the market leader in electric cars and trucks, he is also the CEO of SpaceX. SpaceX designs, manufactures, and launches advanced rockets including Starship, the tallest and most powerful rocket in existence. One thing that makes Musk distinctive is his hands-on approach to product design. Where other CEOs spend a large portion of their time on finance, marketing, and sales, Musk spends a much higher percentage of his time on product design and manufacturing. Here is one excerpt from the book that highlights this theme. “Musk turned his attention to Raptor, the engine that would power Starship.” But Raptor would “have to be manufactured by the hundreds at reasonable cost… Raptor was too complex to be mass-manufactured… So in August 2021, Musk fired the person in charge of its design and personally took on the title of vice president for propulsion.” His goal was to get the cost of each engine to a tenth of what it then cost. To lower costs Musk employs what he calls an “idiot index.” This is the ratio of the total cost of a component to its raw materials. “Something with a high idiot index – say a component that cost $1,000 when the aluminum that composed it cost only $100 – was likely to have a design that was too complex or a manufacturing process that was too inefficient.” Musk threatened to fire a financial analyst that did not know the idiot index numbers like the back of his hand. The next day when that analyst met with Musk, he had the 20 parts with the highest idiot index scores listed on a slide. “It’s mainly the parts,” the analyst explained, “that require a lot of high-precision machining. We need to cut out as much of the machining as possible.” Musk smiled. At both Tesla and SpaceX, Musk put the design engineers in charge of production. He said to the head of production design at SpaceX, for example, “you are responsible for the production process. You can’t hand it off to someone else. If the design is expensive to produce, you change the design.” The 75 design engineers then moved their desks next to the assembly lines to reinforce the idea that product design and manufacturing must work hand-in-hand. One of the themes that emerged from Spend Connect Live was the growing importance of the procurement function. One of the drivers of this is sustainability. As corporations announce plans to be Net Zero across their end-to-end supply chain at some point in the future – often 2050 – they then need their suppliers to participate in helping them meet their goals. And because procurement has a major role in selecting which suppliers a company will work with, companies that are serious about environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues will make sure ESG concerns are reflected in the supplier selection criteria. This journey to integrate procurement more tightly into the ESG process is still early. Cost is still the most important driver of supplier selection. With high inflation rates around the world, cost is more important than ever in procurement decisions. But increasingly corporations are working with companies like EcoVadis to help accelerate their journeys to collect ESG data from suppliers and prospective suppliers. According to EcoVadis, only 20% of suppliers in the EcoVadis network annually report on their emissions. Currently, a supplier looking to satisfy a customer usually goes through a labor-intensive project to collect and analyze their data. Many companies don’t even know how to start these projects. The work EcoVadis is doing is focused on not just getting data, but helping companies be able to get emissions data on an ongoing basis in a much less labor-intensive manner. EcoVadis is a solution partner to SAP, and the EcoVadis ESG data will be able to be pulled into SAP’s new Spend Control Tower if suppliers have calculated their emissions data. If the supplier does not know what their emissions are, artificial intelligence can be employed by the SAP Spend Control Tower solution to estimate the emissions. EcoVadis is also integrated with SAP Business Network, which enables suppliers to showcase their sustainability rating in their network profiles. Buyers can then search for suppliers based on these ratings. Etosha Thurman, the chief marketing & solutions officer for SAP’s Intelligent Spend and Business Network business unit, made the point that for procurement to play a significant role in helping a company meet its ESG goals, procurement needs to be more tightly integrated with the product design function. “Once the specs are set, the ability for procurement to select lower emission suppliers is very limited. By contrast, when procurement teams are involved during the design phase, they can bring to light important sustainable sourcing information before it’s too late to make a difference.” In short, where Elon Musk has focused on integrating product design with manufacturing and procurement, Ms. Thurman is pointing out the necessity of linking procurement more tightly with the product design and sustainability functions.

The Tesla CEO and owner of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, took to his social media account to offer the online encylcopedia a generous donation if they're willing to rename their site. ""I will give them a billion dollars if they change their name to Dickipedia,"" wrote Musk. ""Please add that to the [cow and poop emojis] on my wiki page,"" he continued. ""In the interests of accuracy."" Journalist Ed Krassenstein later chimed in to encourage the organization to make the switch. ""Do it! You can always change it back after you collect,"" wrote Krassenstein. ""One year minimum. I mean, I'm not a fool lol,"" responded Musk. Musk's ""offer"" stems from an earlier tweet where he criticized the Wikimedia Foundation for wanting so much money. ""It certainly isn't needed to operate Wikipedia. You can literally fit a copy of the entire text on your phone!"" tweeted Musk. ""So, what's the money for? Inquiring minds want to know ... "" He didn't have to wait very long for an explanation, courtesy of the app's very own Community Notes citing that the free information organization handles ""over 25B page views per month and over 44M page edits a month, requiring substantial operating costs."" The notes also provided additional context that the Wikimedia Foundation employs third party financial auditors whose reports are made available to the public. It's not the first time Musk and Wikipedia have butted heads. In May, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales criticized Musk for his decision to restrict certain content on X in the lead-up to Turkey's presidential election, according to reporting by Business Insider. The publication also reports that the social media platform had reportedly become more compliant with government requests for censorship and surveillance under Musk's leadership. In 2018, Musk tweeted his intentions to create a website named Pravda where the general public could rate the ""core truth"" of any article and ""track the credibility score"" of journalists, editors, and their publications.

It would also allow smaller creators the opportunity to be discovered by a wider audience, which fits into Musk's plan to turn X into a creator platform.

Ukrainians hit back at SpaceX chief over ‘Vein Popping Guy’ meme.  
Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk mocked Ukraine’s war-time leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday, using a meme to scoff at the president’s calls for Western aid.  “When it’s been 5 min and you haven’t asked for a billion dollars in aid,” read Musk’s message, which accompanied Zelenskyy’s head attached to a famous photo of an agitated schoolboy, who — according to the meme’s etymology — was in a classroom and desperately trying to hold in flatulence.  Musk has had a troubled relationship with Ukrainians and the country’s administration since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion in February 2022, but now they’ve had just about enough of the SpaceX chief and owner of X (formerly Twitter).  “So you have bought social media to bully people who are dying because [they] love freedom,” Ukrainian stand-up comedian Anton Tymoshenko wrote in response to Musk’s post. “Elon, did you write this meme during a friendly conversation with Putin on the phone?” another Ukrainian comic and volunteer, Vasyl Baydak, wrote — alluding to a New Yorker report that Musk and the Russian president spoke directly.  Even Ukrainian media organizations joined the anti-Musk revolt, with top publication Ukrainska Pravda posting the same meme, but with Musk’s face photoshopped in, saying: “When’s it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t spread Russian propaganda.” Zelenskyy has not yet reacted to Musk’s post. But one of his office advisers, Serhiy Leshchenko, hit back in a tweet accusing Musk of “trolling.” Musk’s meme comes shortly after U.S. President Joe Biden signed a temporary budget bill featuring no Ukraine aid to avert the American government’s shutdown. Shortly after Putin’s assault on Kyiv began last year, Musk was hailed in Ukraine thanks to his early decision to provide Starlink satellite internet for the country. But that narrative flipped after he began spreading what Ukraine said was pro-Russian propaganda via his social media. According to a new biography of the tech boss, Musk also secretly ordered his engineers to disable Starlink satellite communications near the coast of Russian-occupied Crimea last year to sabotage a planned Ukrainian drone strike.  Last week, the European Commission slammed Musk’s X as the social media platform which is the biggest source of disinformation.  Log in to access content and manage your profile.

While at Queen's University in Canada, Musk and his brother Kimbal employed an unconventional method for mentorship: cold-calling people they found intriguing. One such person was Peter Nicholson, a high-ranking executive at Scotiabank. What made this relationship interesting were the subjects discussed. Instead of mere career advice, the discussions ventured into Latin American debt, Brady bonds and electric cars — a passion that would later consume much of Musk's career. But beyond the subjects discussed, what stood out was Musk's insatiable curiosity, an attribute that would mark many of his future ventures. Don't Miss: Until 2016 it was illegal for retail investors to invest in high-growth startups. Thanks to changes in federal law, this Kevin O’Leary-backed startup lets you become a venture capitalist with $100. With returns as high as 300%, it’s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires. Uncover the secret. He was offered a summer job at Scotiabank making $14 an hour. The experience would shape his views on the financial sector for years to come. The job gave Musk the opportunity to pitch new ideas. He proposed a trade involving Brady bonds, which he believed were undervalued and backed by the U.S. government, making them a low-risk investment. Despite presenting what he saw as a compelling plan and golden opportunity, the bank's management rejected the proposal. This led Musk to an unfiltered conclusion that he later shared with biographer Ashlee Vance. ""Bankers are rich and dumb,"" Musk said. ""All the bankers did was copy what everyone else did."" This critical view became a cornerstone of Musk's philosophy as he ventured into the world of finance with X.com, which eventually evolved into PayPal Holdings Inc. after merging with Confinity Inc. The platform challenged traditional banking systems and offered an alternative that has become an online transaction staple. Trending: Join the ranks of investors like Bill Gates and Mark Cuban by tapping into early-stage startups. Get the inside scoop on this innovative startup here. Musk's willingness to disrupt extends beyond finance. Whether it's SpaceX's rockets or Tesla Inc.'s electric cars, he has a knack for shaking up industries. His early skepticism about traditional banking possibly fueled his confidence to take on grand challenges across different sectors. Another critical takeaway from Musk's time at Scotiabank was his realization that he did not enjoy working for others — nor was he good at it, according to his latest biography written by Walter Isaacson. His disdain for conventional employment is an essential part of his DNA, shaping his decision to forge his own path in various industries. While not everyone is wired to become a Musk, the booming field of startups offers a plethora of opportunities to benefit financially from the visionaries of the world. Investing in startups gives people the chance to be part of transformative changes across various industries. You may not want to or be able to build the next SpaceX or Tesla, but by backing those who can, there's potential for significant financial gains and perhaps a piece of the revolutionary pie. Platforms like StartEngine make it possible for anyone to invest. Musk's early experiences, like his time at Scotiabank, have been instrumental in shaping his approach to business and life. His critique of the banking industry, summarized by the assertion that ""bankers are rich and dumb"" and his aversion to traditional employment have played key roles in his rise to prominence. His story is a beacon for aspiring entrepreneurs and investors, proving that challenging the status quo can be the first step toward changing the world.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop,Hyperloop - Wikipedia,20231001,Hyperloop is a proposed high-speed transportation system for both public and goods transport. The idea was picked up by Elon Musk and SpaceX engineers as a ...," 
Hyperloop is a proposed high-speed transportation system for both public and goods transport. The idea was picked up by Elon Musk and SpaceX engineers as a means to disrupt a proposed California High-Speed Rail system[1][2] and described as a transportation project involving capsules supported by air-bearings in low-pressure environment inside a tube.[3] Hyperloop systems have three essential elements: tubes, pods, and terminals. The tube is a large, sealed low-pressure system (usually a long tunnel). The pod is a coach pressurized at atmospheric pressure that experiences low air resistance or friction inside this tube[4] using magnetic propulsion (in the initial design, augmented by a ducted fan). The terminal handles pod arrivals and departures. The Hyperloop, in the initial form proposed by Musk, differs from vactrains by relying on residual air pressure inside the tube to provide lift by aerofoils and propulsion by fans;[5] however, many subsequent variants using the name ""Hyperloop"" have been relatively traditional vactrains. 
Hyperloop was teased by Elon Musk in a 2012 speaking event, described as a ""fifth mode of transport"".[6] Musk further promoted the concept by publishing a white paper in August 2013, which conceived of a Hyperloop route running from the Los Angeles region to the San Francisco Bay Area, roughly following the Interstate 5 corridor.[5] The initial concept incorporated reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on air bearings driven by linear induction motors and axial compressors.[7] Some transportation analysts challenged the cost estimates included in the white paper, with some predicting that a realized Hyperloop would be several billion dollars over budget.[8][9][10] 
The Hyperloop concept has been promoted by Musk and SpaceX, and other companies or organizations have been encouraged to collaborate and develop the technology.[11] Hardt Hyperloop demonstrated a Hyperloop lane switch without moving components in the infrastructure in June 2019 at its test site in Delft, The Netherlands.[12] Technical University of Munich Hyperloop set the hyperloop speed record of 463 km/h (288 mph) in July 2019[13][14] at the pod design competition hosted by SpaceX in Hawthorne, California.[15] Virgin Hyperloop conducted the first human trial in November 2020 at its test site in Las Vegas, reaching a top speed of 172 km/h (107 mph).[16] Swisspod Technologies unveiled a 1:12 scale testing facility in a circular shape to simulate an ""infinite"" hyperloop trajectory in July 2021 on the EPFL campus at Lausanne, Switzerland.[17] 
In 2023 the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization released the first technical standard for hyperloop systems.[18] 
Musk first mentioned that he was thinking about a concept for a ""fifth mode of transport"", calling it the Hyperloop, in July 2012 at a Pando Daily event in Santa Monica, California. This hypothetical high-speed mode of transportation would have the following characteristics: immunity to weather, collision free, twice the speed of a plane, low power consumption, and energy storage for 24-hour operations.[19] The name Hyperloop was chosen because it would go in a loop. Musk envisions the more advanced versions will be able to go at hypersonic speed.[20] In May 2013, Musk likened Hyperloop to a ""cross between a Concorde and a railgun and an air hockey table"".[21] 
From late 2012 until August 2013, a group of engineers from both Tesla and SpaceX worked on the modeling of Musk's Hyperloop.[22] An early system conceptual model was published in the Tesla and SpaceX blogs[5][23] which describes one potential design, function, pathway, and cost of a hyperloop system.[5] According to the alpha design, pods would accelerate to cruising speeds gradually using linear electric motors and glide above their track on air bearings through tubes above ground on columns or below ground in tunnels to avoid the dangers of grade crossings. An ideal hyperloop system will be more energy-efficient,[24][25] quiet, and autonomous than existing modes of mass transit. Musk has also invited feedback to ""see if the people can find ways to improve it"". The Hyperloop Alpha was released as an open source design.[26] The trademark ""HYPERLOOP"", applicable to ""high-speed transportation of goods in tubes"" was issued to SpaceX on 4 April 2017.[27][28] 
In June 2015, SpaceX announced that it would build a 1-mile-long (1.6 km) Hyperloop pod competition#Test track/test track to be located next to SpaceX's Hawthorne facility. The track was completed and used to test pod designs supplied by third parties in the competition.[29][30] 
By November 2015, with several commercial companies and dozens of student teams pursuing the development of Hyperloop technologies, the Wall Street Journal asserted that ""The Hyperloop Movement"", as some of its unaffiliated members refer to themselves, is officially bigger than the man who started it.""[31] 
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) hyperloop team developed the first hyperloop pod prototype, which they unveiled at the MIT Museum on 13 May 2016. Their design uses electrodynamic suspension for levitating and eddy current braking.[32] 
The first passenger test of hyperloop technology was successfully conducted by Virgin Hyperloop with two employees of the company in November 2020, where the unit reached a maximum speed of 172 km/h (107 mph).[33] 
The vactrain concept resembles a high-speed rail system without substantial air resistance by employing magnetically levitating trains in evacuated (airless) or partly evacuated tubes. However, the difficulty of maintaining a vacuum over large distances has prevented this type of system from ever being built. By contrast, Hyperloop operates at approximately one millibar (100 Pa) of pressure and requires the air for levitation.[34] 
The hyperloop concept operates by sending specially designed ""capsules"" or ""pods"" through a steel tube maintained at a partial vacuum. In Musk's original concept, each capsule would float on a 0.02–0.05 in (0.5–1.3 mm) layer of air provided under pressure to air-caster ""skis"", similar to how pucks are levitated above an air hockey table, while still allowing higher speeds than wheels can sustain. With rolling resistance eliminated and air resistance greatly reduced, the capsules can glide for the bulk of the journey. In the alpha design concept, an electrically driven inlet fan and axial compressor would be placed at the nose of the capsule to ""actively transfer high-pressure air from the front to the rear of the vessel"", resolving the problem of air pressure building in front of the vehicle, slowing it down. A fraction of the air was to be shunted to the skis for additional pressure, augmenting that gain passively from lift due to their shape.[5] 
In the alpha-level concept, passenger-only pods were to be 7 ft 4 in (2.23 m) in diameter and were projected to reach a top speed of 760 mph (1,220 km/h) to maintain aerodynamic efficiency.[5] (Section 4.4) The design proposed passengers experience a maximum inertial acceleration of 0.5 g, about 2 or 3 times that of a commercial airliner on takeoff and landing.[citation needed] 
A number of routes have been proposed for hyperloop systems that meet the approximate distance conditions for which a hyperloop is hypothesized to provide improved transport times (distances of under approximately 1,500 kilometres (930 miles)).[35] Route proposals range from speculation described in company releases to business cases to signed agreements. 
The route suggested in the 2013 alpha-level design document was from the Greater Los Angeles Area to the San Francisco Bay Area. That conceptual system would begin around Sylmar, just south of the Tejon Pass, follow Interstate 5 to the north, and arrive near Hayward on the east side of San Francisco Bay. Several proposed branches were also shown in the design document, including Sacramento, Anaheim, San Diego, and Las Vegas.[5] 
No work has been done on the route proposed in Musk's alpha-design; one cited reason is that it would terminate on the fringes of the two major metropolitan areas (Los Angeles and San Francisco), resulting in significant cost savings in construction, but requiring passengers traveling to and from Downtown Los Angeles and San Francisco, and any other community beyond Sylmar and Hayward, to transfer to another transportation mode in order to reach their final destination. This would significantly lengthen the total travel time to those destinations.[36] 
A similar problem already affects present-day air travel, where on short routes (like LAX–SFO) the flight time is only a rather small part of door-to-door travel time. Critics have argued that this would significantly reduce the proposed cost and/or time savings of hyperloop as compared to the proposed California High-Speed Rail project that will serve downtown stations in both San Francisco and Los Angeles.[37][38][39] Passengers traveling from financial center to financial center are estimated to save about two hours by taking the Hyperloop instead of driving the whole distance.[40] 
Others questioned the cost projections for the suggested California route. Some transportation engineers argued in 2013 that they found the alpha-level design cost estimates unrealistically low given the scale of construction and reliance on unproven technology. The technological and economic feasibility of the idea is unproven and a subject of significant debate.[8][9][10][36] 
In November 2017, Arrivo announced a concept for a maglev automobile transport system from Aurora, Colorado to Denver International Airport, the first leg of a system from downtown Denver.[41] Its contract described potential completion of a first leg in 2021. In February 2018, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies announced a similar plan for a loop connecting Chicago and Cleveland and a loop connecting Washington and New York City.[42] 
In 2018 the Missouri Hyperloop Coalition was formed between Virgin Hyperloop One, the University of Missouri, and engineering firm Black & Veatch to study a proposed route connecting St. Louis, Columbia, and Kansas City.[43][44] 
On 19 December 2018, Elon Musk unveiled a 2-mile (3 km) tunnel below Los Angeles. In the presentation, a Tesla Model X drove in a tunnel on the predefined track (rather than in a low-pressure tube). According to Musk, the costs for the system are US$10 million.[45] Musk said: ""The Loop is a stepping stone toward hyperloop. The Loop is for transport within a city. Hyperloop is for transport between cities, and that would go much faster than 150 mph.""[46] 
The Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency, or NOACA, partnered with Hyperloop Transportation Technologies[when?] to conduct a $1.3 million feasibility study for developing a hyperloop corridor route from Chicago to Cleveland and Pittsburgh for America's first multistate hyperloop system in the Great Lakes Megaregion. Hundreds of thousands of dollars have already been committed to the project. NOACA's Board of Directors has awarded a $550,029 contract to Transportation Economics & Management Systems, Inc. (TEMS) for the Great Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study to evaluate the feasibility of an ultra-high speed hyperloop passenger and freight transport system initially linking Cleveland and Chicago.[47][full citation needed] 
Hyperloop Transportation Technologies were considering in 2016 with the Indian Government for a proposed route between Chennai and Bengaluru, with a conceptual travel time of 345 km (214 mi) in 30 minutes.[48] HTT also signed an agreement with Andhra Pradesh government to build India's first hyperloop project connecting Amaravathi to Vijayawada in a 6-minute ride.[49] 
On 22 February 2018, Hyperloop One entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Maharashtra to build a hyperloop transportation system between Mumbai and Pune that would cut the travel time from the current 180 minutes to 20 minutes.[50][51] 
Indore-based Dinclix GroundWorks' DGWHyperloop advocates a hyperloop corridor between Mumbai and Delhi, via Indore, Kota, and Jaipur.[52] 
The Ministry of Railways will collaborate with IIT Madras for the development of an ""indigenous"" Hyperloop system and will help set-up a Centre of Excellence for Hyperloop Technologies at IIT.[53] 
On 6 February 2020, the Ministry of Transport in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia announced a contract agreement with Virgin Hyperloop One (VHO) to conduct a ground-breaking pre-feasibility study on the use of hyperloop technology for the transport of passengers and cargo.[54] The study will serve as a blueprint for future hyperloop projects and build on the developers long-standing relationship with the kingdom, which has peaked when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman viewed VHO's passenger pod during a visit to the United States.[54] 
On 29 December 2021, the Veneto Regional Council approved a memorandum of understanding with MIMS and CAV for the testing of hyper transfer technology.[55] By mid 2023, the feasibility study by a company selected by CAV will have to be completed and the development of a first prototype completed in 2026. 4 million euro have been allocated for this phase.[citation needed] 
Canadian hyperloop firm TransPod is exploring the possibility of hyperloop routes which would connect Toronto and Montreal,[56][57] Toronto to Windsor,[58] and Calgary to Edmonton.[59] Toronto and Montreal, the largest cities in Canada, are connected by Ontario Highway 401, the busiest highway in North America.[60] In March 2019, Transport Canada commissioned the study of hyperloops, so it can be ""better informed on the technical, operational, economic, safety, and regulatory aspects of the hyperloop and understand its construction requirements and commercial feasibility.""[61] 
The province of Alberta signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to support TransPod for its Calgary to Edmonton hyperloop project. TransPod plans to move forward and has secured US$550 million in private capital funding for the first phase, which will create an airport link for Edmonton. However, the company will first need to build and test prototypes on test tracks before the project can begin.[62][63] 
In 2016, Hyperloop One published the world's first detailed business case for a 300-mile  (500 km) route between Helsinki and Stockholm, which would tunnel under the Baltic Sea to connect the two capitals in under 30 minutes.[64] Hyperloop One undertook a feasibility study with DP World to move containers from its Port of Jebel Ali in Dubai.[65] In late 2016, Hyperloop One announced a feasibility study with Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority for passenger and freight routes connecting Dubai with the greater United Arab Emirates. Hyperloop One was also considering passenger routes in Moscow during 2016,[66] and a cargo hyperloop to connect Hunchun in north-eastern China to the Port of Zarubino, near Vladivostok and the North Korean border on Russia's Far East.[67] In May 2016, Hyperloop One kicked off their Global Challenge with a call for comprehensive proposals of hyperloop networks around the world.[68] In September 2017, Hyperloop One selected 10 routes from 35 of the strongest proposals: Toronto–Montreal, Cheyenne–Denver–Pueblo, Miami–Orlando, Dallas–Laredo–Houston, Chicago–Columbus–Pittsburgh, Mexico City–Guadalajara, Edinburgh–London, Glasgow–Liverpool, Bengaluru–Chennai, and Mumbai–Chennai.[69][70] 
Others have put forward European routes, including a route beginning at Amsterdam or Schiphol airport to Frankfurt.[71][72][73] In 2016, a Warsaw University of Technology team began evaluating potential routes from Cracow to Gdańsk across Poland proposed by Hyper Poland.[74] 
Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) reportedly signed an agreement with the government of Slovakia in March 2016 to perform impact studies, with potential links between Bratislava, Vienna, and Budapest, but there have been no further developments.[75] In January 2017, HTT signed an agreement to explore the route Bratislava—Brno—Prague in Central Europe.[76] 
In 2017, SINTEF, the largest independent research organization in Scandinavia, announced they were considering building a test lab for hyperloop in Norway.[77] 
An agreement was signed in June 2017 to co-develop a hyperloop line between Seoul and Busan, South Korea.[78][79] 
According to Musk, hyperloop would be useful on Mars as no tubes would be needed because Mars' atmosphere is about 1% the density of the Earth's at sea level.[80][20][81][82] For the hyperloop concept to work on Earth, low-pressure tubes are required to reduce air resistance. However, if they were to be built on Mars, the lower air resistance would allow a hyperloop to be created with no tube, only a track, and so would be just a magnetically levitating train.[83] 
In September 2013, Ansys Corporation ran computational fluid dynamics simulations to model the aerodynamics of the capsule and shear stress forces to which the capsule would be subjected. The simulation showed that the capsule design would need to be significantly reshaped to avoid creating supersonic airflow, and that the gap between the tube wall and capsule would need to be larger. Ansys employee Sandeep Sovani said the simulation showed that hyperloop has challenges but that he is convinced it is feasible.[84][85] 
In October 2013, the development team of the OpenMDAO software framework released an unfinished, conceptual open-source model of parts of the hyperloop's propulsion system. The team asserted that the model demonstrated the concept's feasibility, although the tube would need to be 13 feet (4 m) in diameter,[86] significantly larger than originally projected. However, the team's model is not a true working model of the propulsion system, as it did not account for a wide range of technical factors required to physically construct a hyperloop based on Musk's concept, and in particular had no significant estimations of component weight.[87] 
In November 2013, MathWorks analyzed the proposal's suggested route and concluded that the route was mainly feasible. The analysis focused on the acceleration experienced by passengers and the necessary deviations from public roads in order to keep the accelerations reasonable; it did highlight that maintaining a trajectory along I-580 east of San Francisco at the planned speeds was not possible without significant deviation into heavily populated areas.[88] 
In January 2015, a paper based on the NASA OpenMDAO open-source model reiterated the need for a larger diameter tube and a reduced cruise speed closer to Mach 0.85. It recommended removing on-board heat exchangers based on thermal models of the interactions between the compressor cycle, tube, and ambient environment. The compression cycle would only contribute 5% of the heat added to the tube, with 95% of the heat attributed to radiation and convection into the tube. The weight and volume penalty of on-board heat exchangers would not be worth the minor benefit, and regardless the steady-state temperature in the tube would only reach 30–40 °F (17–22 °C) above ambient temperature.[89] 
According to Musk, various aspects of the hyperloop have technology applications to other Musk interests, including surface transportation on Mars and electric jet propulsion.[90][91] 
Researchers associated with MIT's department of Aeronautics and Astronautics published research in June 2017 that verified the challenge of aerodynamic design near the Kantrowitz limit that had been theorized in the original SpaceX Alpha-design concept released in 2013.[92] 
In 2017, Dr. Richard Geddes and others formed the Hyperloop Advanced Research Partnership to act as a clearinghouse of Hyperloop public domain reports and data.[93] 
In February 2020, Hardt Hyperloop, Nevomo (formerly Hyper Poland), TransPod and Zeleros formed a consortium to drive standardization efforts, as part of a joint technical committee (JTC20) set up by European standards bodies CEN and CENELEC to develop common standards aimed at ensuring the safety and interoperability of infrastructure, rolling stock, signaling and other systems.[94] 
In December 2022 Hyperloop companies Hardt, Hyperloop One, Hyperloop Transport Technologies, Nevomo, Swisspod Technologies, TransPod, and Zeleros formed the Hyperloop Association. The Association's stated aims are to stimulate the development and growth of this emerging new transport market, participate and support institutes in collaborating with government and regulatory agencies on transportation policymaking. The Hyperloop Association is represented by Ben Paczek, CEO and co-founder of Nevomo.[95] 
EuroTube is a non-profit research organization for the development of vacuum transport technology.[96] EuroTube is currently developing a 3.1 km (1.9 mi) test tube in Collombey-Muraz, Switzerland. The organization was founded in 2017 at ETH Zurich as a Swiss association and became a Swiss foundation in 2019.[97] The test tube is planned on a 2:1 scale with a diameter of 2.2 m and designed for 900 km/h (560 mph) 
The Hyperloop Development Program is a public-private partnership of public sector partners, industry parties, and research institutions dedicated to prove the feasibility of hyperloop, test and demonstrate in the European Hyperloop Center Groningen, and identify the future prospects and opportunities for industry and stakeholders. The European Hyperloop Center is under constructions and will have a 420-meter test facility including a lane switch and is planned to commence testing in 2024.[98] The total program size is €30 million and it is co-funded with €4.5 million by the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management and Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy,[99] and €3 million by the Dutch Province of Groningen.[100] Partners in the program include AndAnotherday, ADSE, Royal BAM Group, Berenschot, Busch, Delft Hyperloop, Denys, Dutch Boosting Group, EuroTube, Hardt Hyperloop, the Institute of Hyperloop Technology, Royal IHC, INTIS, Mercon, Nevomo, Nederlandse Spoorwegen, POSCO International, Schiphol Group, Schweizer Design Consulting, Tata Steel, TÜV Rheinland, UNStudio, Vattenfall. 
TUM Hyperloop is a research program that emerged in 2019 from the team of hyperloop pod competition from the Technical University of Munich. The TUM Hyperloop team had won the latest three competitions in a row, achieving the world record of 463 km/h (288 mph), which is still valid today.[13][14] The research program has the goals to investigate the technical feasibility by means of a demonstrator, as well as by simulating the economic and technical feasibility of the hyperloop system. The planned 24 meter demonstrator will consist of a tube and the full-size pod.[101] The next steps after completion of the first project phase are the extension to 400 meters to investigate higher speeds. This is planned in the Munich area, in Taufkirchen, Ottobrunn or at the Oberpfaffenhofen airfield.[102] Certification for operation started in Ottobrun in July 2023.[103] 
A number of student and non-student teams were participating in a hyperloop pod competition in 2015–16, and at least 22 of them built hardware to compete on a sponsored hyperloop test track in mid-2016.[104] 
In June 2015, SpaceX announced that they would sponsor a hyperloop pod design competition and would build a 1-mile-long (1.6 km) subscale test track near SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California, for the competitive event in 2016.[105][106] SpaceX stated in their announcement, ""Neither SpaceX nor Elon Musk is affiliated with any Hyperloop companies. While we are not developing a commercial Hyperloop ourselves, we are interested in helping to accelerate development of a functional Hyperloop prototype.""[107] 
More than 700 teams had submitted preliminary applications by July.[108][109] A preliminary design briefing was held in November 2015, where more than 120 student engineering teams were selected to submit Final Design Packages due by 13 January 2016.[110] 
A Design Weekend was held at Texas A&M University 29–30 January 2016, for all invited entrants.[111] Engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were named the winners of the competition. While the University of Washington team won the Safety Subsystem Award, Delft University won the Pod Innovation Award[112] as well as the second place, followed by the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Virginia Tech, and the University of California, Irvine.[104][113] In the Design Category, the winning team was Hyperloop UPV from Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Spain.[114] On 29 January 2017, Delft Hyperloop (Delft University of Technology) won the prize for the ""best overall design"" at the final stage of the SpaceX hyperloop competition,[115] while WARR Hyperloop of the Technical University of Munich won the prize for ""fastest pod"".[116] The Massachusetts Institute of Technology placed third.[117] 
The second hyperloop pod competition took place from 25 to 27 August 2017. The only judging criteria being top speed provided it is followed by successful deceleration. WARR Hyperloop from the Technical University of Munich won the competition by reaching a top speed of 324 km/h (201 mph).[118][119][120] 
A third hyperloop pod competition took place in July 2018. The defending champions, the WARR Hyperloop team from the Technical University of Munich, beat their own record with a top speed of 457 km/h (284 mph) during their run.[121] The Delft Hyperloop team representing Delft University of Technology landed in second place, while the EPFLoop team from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) earned the third-place finish.[122][123][124] 
The fourth competition in August 2019 saw the team from the Technical University of Munich, now known as TUM Hyperloop (by NEXT Prototypes e.V.),[125] again winning the competition and beating their own record with a top speed of 463 km/h (288 mph).[116] 
YouTube creator Adam Kovacs has described Hyperloop as a kind of gadgetbahn because it would be an expensive, unproven system that is no better than existing technology like traditional high-speed rail.[126] Some critics of Hyperloop focus on the experience—possibly unpleasant and frightening—of riding in a narrow, sealed, windowless capsule inside a sealed steel tunnel, that is subjected to significant acceleration forces; high noise levels due to air being compressed and ducted around the capsule at near-sonic speeds; and the vibration and jostling.[127] Even if the tube is initially smooth, ground may shift with seismic activity. At high speeds, even minor deviations from a straight path may add considerable buffeting.[128] This is in addition to practical and logistical questions regarding how to best deal with safety issues such as equipment malfunction, accidents, and emergency evacuations. 
There is also the criticism of design technicalities in the tube system. John Hansman, professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT, has pointed out problems, such as how a slight misalignment in the tube would be compensated for, and the potential interplay between the air cushion and the low-pressure air. He has also questioned what would happen if the power were to go out when the pod was miles away from a city. UC Berkeley physics professor Richard Muller has also expressed concern regarding ""[the Hyperloop's] novelty and the vulnerability of its tubes, [which] would be a tempting target for terrorists"", and that the system could be disrupted by everyday dirt and grime.[129] 
The alpha proposal projected that cost savings compared with conventional rail would come from a combination of several factors. The small profile and elevated nature of the alpha route would enable Hyperloop to be constructed primarily in the median of Interstate 5. However, whether this would be truly feasible is a matter of debate. The low profile would reduce tunnel boring requirements and the light weight of the capsules is projected to reduce construction costs over conventional passenger rail. It was asserted that there would be less right-of-way opposition and environmental impact as well due to its small, sealed, elevated profile versus that of a rail easement;[5] however, other commentators contend that a smaller footprint does not guarantee less opposition.[36] In criticizing this assumption, mass transportation writer Alon Levy said, ""In reality, an all-elevated system (which is what Musk proposes with the Hyperloop) is a bug rather than a feature. Central Valley land is cheap; pylons are expensive, as can be readily seen by the costs of elevated highways and trains all over the world"".[130][131] Michael Anderson, a professor of agricultural and resource economics at UC Berkeley, predicted that costs would amount to around US$100 billion.[9] 
Projected low ticket prices by Hyperloop developers have been questioned by Dan Sperling, director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at University of California Davis, who stated that ""there's no way the economics on that would ever work out.""[9] Some critics have argued that, since Hyperloop is designed to carry fewer passengers than typical public train systems, it could make it difficult to price tickets to cover the costs of construction and running.[132] In a study done by the TU Delft researchers claim that the fares would have to be higher than €0.30 per passenger kilometer, compared to €0.174/p-km for high speed rail and €0.183/p-km for air travel.[133] 
The early cost estimates of the hyperloop are a subject of debate. A number of economists and transportation experts have expressed the belief that the US$6 billion price tag dramatically understates the cost of designing, developing, constructing, and testing an all-new form of transportation.[8][9][36][131] The Economist magazine said that the estimates are unlikely to ""be immune to the hypertrophication of cost that every other grand infrastructure project seems doomed to suffer.""[134] Hyperloop One estimated that for a loop around the Bay Area the costs were in a range on $9 billion to $13 billion in total, or from $84 million to $121 million per mile. For another project in the United Arab Emirates the company estimated $52 million per mile and for a Stockholm-Helsinki route the company reported a cost of $64 million per mile.[135] 
Political impediments to the construction of such a project in California may be large due to the ""political and reputation capital"" invested in the existing mega-project of California High-Speed Rail.[134] Because replacing that with a different design would not be straightforward given California's political economy, Texas has been suggested as an alternate for its more amenable political and economic environment.[134] 
Building a successful hyperloop sub-scale demonstration project could reduce the political impediments and improve cost estimates. In 2013, Musk suggested that he might become personally involved in building a demonstration prototype of the hyperloop concept, including funding the development effort.[134][22] 
The solar panels Musk plans to install along the length of the hyperloop system have been criticized by engineering professor Roger Goodall of Loughborough University, as not being feasible enough to return enough energy to power the hyperloop system, arguing that the air pumps and propulsion would require much more power than the solar panels could generate.[129] 
According to The New York Times, ""The central impediment"" to the Hyperloop is that it ""would require creating an entire infrastructure. That means constructing miles-long systems of tubes and stations, acquiring rights of way, adhering to government regulations and standards, and avoiding changes to the ecology along its routes.""[136] 
Various concepts have been made over the years for modes of transport involving different pressures (both high and low) in tubes. 
The first patent to transport goods in pneumatic tubes, using high pressures behind a capsule to move it forward, was created in 1799 by the British mechanical engineer and inventor George Medhurst. In 1812, Medhurst wrote a book detailing his idea of transporting passengers and goods through air-tight tubes using air propulsion.[142] 
In the early 1800s, there were other similar systems proposed or experimented with and were generally known as atmospheric railway projects, though this term is now also used for systems where the propulsion is provided by a separate pneumatic tube to the train tunnel itself. One of the earliest constructions was the Dalkey Atmospheric Railway which operated near Dublin between 1844 and 1854. 
The Crystal Palace pneumatic railway operated in London around 1864 and used large fans, some 22 ft (6.7 m) in diameter, that were powered by a steam engine. The tunnels are now lost but the line operated successfully for over a year. 
Operated from 1870 to 1873, the Beach Pneumatic Transit from inventor Alfred Ely Beach was a one-block-long prototype of an underground tube transport public transit system in New York City. The system worked at near-atmospheric pressure, and the passenger car moved by means of higher pressure air applied to the back of the car while comparatively lower pressure air was maintained on the front of the car.[143] 
In the 1910s, vacuum trains were first described by American rocket pioneer Robert Goddard.[134] Unlike pneumatic tubes, these do not use pressure for propulsion, but instead utilize a hard vacuum to eliminate drag ahead of the vehicle. The vehicle is both suspended and propelled by magnetic levitation. 
In 1981, Princeton physicist Gerard K. O'Neill wrote about transcontinental trains using magnetic propulsion in his book 2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future. Though being a work of fiction, this book was an attempt to predict future technologies in everyday life. In his prediction, he envisioned these trains which used magnetic levitation running in tunnels which had much of the air evacuated to increase speed and significantly reduce friction. He also demonstrated a scale prototype device that accelerated an object using magnetic propulsion to high speeds. It was called a mass driver and was a central theme in his non-fiction book on space colonization ""The High Frontier"". 
Swissmetro was a proposal to run a maglev train in a low-pressure environment. Concessions were granted to Swissmetro in the early 2000s to connect the Swiss cities of St. Gallen, Zurich, Basel, and Geneva. Studies of commercial feasibility reached differing conclusions and the vactrain was never built.[144] 
The ET3 Global Alliance (ET3) was founded by Daryl Oster in 1997 with the goal of establishing a global transportation system using passenger capsules in frictionless maglev full-vacuum tubes. Oster and his team met with Elon Musk on 18 September 2013, to discuss the technology,[145] resulting in Musk promising an investment in a 3-mile (5 km) prototype of ET3's proposed design.[146][needs update] 
From 2003 Franco Cotana led the development of Pipenet which had a small bore evacuated tube for moving freight at up to 2,000 km/h (1,200 mph) using linear synchronous motors and magnetic levitation. A prototype system – 100 m (110 yd) long and 1.25 m (1.37 yd) in diameter – was constructed in Italy in 2005. However development stopped after funding ceased.[147] 
China was reported to be building a vacuum based 600 mph (1,000 km/h) maglev train in August 2010 according to a laboratory at Southwest Jiaotong University. It was expected to cost CN¥10–20 million (US$2.95 million at the August 2010 exchange rate) more per kilometer than regular high-speed rail.[148] In 2018 a 45 m (49 yd) loop test track was completed to test some of the technology.[149] 
In 2018, the new concept of creating and using intermodal Hyperloop capsules was presented. After detaching the drive elements, capsules could be used in a way similar to traditional containers for fast transport of goods or individuals. It has been proposed that specialized airplanes, dedicated high-speed trains, road tractors or watercrafts perform ""last mile"" transport for solving the problem of fast transportation to centers where hyperloop terminals are locally unavailable or infeasible to be constructed.[150] 
In May 2021, it was reported that a low-vacuum sealed tube test system capable of reaching speeds around 1,000 km/h (620 mph) had begun construction in Datong, Shanxi Province. An initial 2 km (1.2 mi) section was completed in 2022 and the full 15 km (9.3 mi) test line is planned to be completed within two years. The line is being constructed by the North University of China and the Third Research Institute of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation.[151] 
In July 2021, the first European operational Hyperloop testing facility was presented.[152] The infrastructure was built by the Swiss-American startup Swisspod Technologies and the Distributed Electrical Systems Laboratory (DESL) of École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. The low-pressure tube was designed in a circular shape to simulate an infinite Hyperloop trajectory. This will allow for fundamental, more accurate experiments related to the capsule's efficiency, electromagnetic propulsion, and levitation systems when exposed to high speeds on long distances. The tube is made of aluminum alloy, has a diameter of 40 m (130 ft), and is 120 m (390 ft) long.[17] 
In September 2021, Swisspod Technologies and MxV Rail (formerly TTCI), a subsidiary of the Association of American Railroads (AAR), started a collaboration for building a full-scale testing facility for Hyperloop technology on the Pueblo Plex campus in Pueblo, Colorado, US. The primary purpose of this facility is to conduct research and development activities on Swisspod's proprietary Hyperloop propulsion system. Additionally, the company plans to build a full-scale capsule and establish a functional infrastructure for testing hyperloop systems for cargo transportation.[153][154]

Twitter Is at Death's Door, One Year After Elon Musk's Takeover · On Oct. · Nearly a year later, you'd be hard pressed to name a single ...","
							By  	Miles Klee  On Oct. 26,  2022, Elon Musk enjoyed his first and last good day as the head of Twitter (now X). Following a $44 billion acquisition he tried to scuttle but was legally forced into closing, he attempted a bit of prop comedy — entering the company’s headquarters with a porcelain sink while flashing a mischievous smile. It was all the setup to a groaner of a pun announcing his arrival: “Let that sink in!” he declared in the video caption of his entrance. It was a master class in cringe. Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in! pic.twitter.com/D68z4K2wq7 
	Nearly a year later, you’d be hard pressed to name a single improvement to the site under Musk’s direction. His biggest ideas have all blown up in his face: An $8 monthly subscription fee for a blue check that verified users then needed the option of hiding to avoid mockery. The abandonment of a valuable brand name and logo in favor of the meaningless “X,” which prompted a trademark lawsuit and led to the installation of a garish metal X structure on the roof of Twitter’s office — city inspectors had it removed just days later. Musk’s latest move is to have headlines stripped from article links, leaving only an image and media source, which he seems to believe looks better and will keep users scrolling. But for those who follow news on the app, it makes X that much more pointless.  	     
i love clicking on a stock Getty image and having no clue what the article is going to be about, great job https://t.co/vYpw9aYgIZ 
	Of course, these mistakes pale in comparison to the rancid vibes Musk has cultivated by reinstating right-wing extremists and peddlers of misinformation previously banned from the platform, amplifying their conspiracy theories, and ensuring their garbage posts are shoved into “For You” feeds by Twitter’s algorithms. He buys into white supremacist propaganda, panders to anti-LGBTQ hate accounts, and, with advertisers fleeing these intolerable conditions, found a way to blame the catastrophic loss of revenue on a Jewish civil rights group that combats antisemitism.  
	How much longer can this wreckage of a formerly semi-functional website stay afloat? Although it has shed millions of daily active users since Musk started tinkering with it, the endgame is more likely to come down to money. Seven banks led by Morgan Stanley hold some $13 billion in debt after backing Musk’s blockbuster deal last year, and the company itself is presumably worth much less at this point — even according to his own math. If X can’t keep making its $300 million quarterly interest payments, the financial firms may repossess it in order to recoup a fraction of their losses.

Like a financial black hole, X threatens to consume most of whatever value it once had, says @jennifersaba https://t.co/NCvdLotbZy pic.twitter.com/QxzqD98Gm8 
	These days, when you mention Musk’s countless blunders in running X, you get a standard retort from his defenders. It doesn’t matter if you’re taking stock of his mounting desperation (like when he begged Taylor Swift to release music on the platform), or a technical fail that reveals an infrastructure coming apart at the seams (such as a frozen livestream at the U.S.-Mexico border, where he’d put on his cowboy hat to grandstand as an anti-immigration ideologue, a glitch that prompted him to send an email reading “Please fix this” to all employees). The reply is always more or less the same: If Twitter is really dying, why are you still posting on it? 
	It’s a fair question, even if it dodges the issue of Musk’s rank incompetence. I suppose a mixture of spite and morbid curiosity goes a long way toward keeping a person like me around. On the other hand, it’s not my first time having an online community hollowed out by a hostile force, and there’s something to be said for making the most of the end with your remaining friends — sharing gallows humor and a sense of humanity as the situation continues to devolve. 	     
NEWS: X has added a description “formerly Twitter” to its iOS app page. , replacing the earlier tagline ""Blaze your glory."" (h/t @cb_doge)This is likely to combat X’s slip in app store download rankings as a result of people not knowing yet the app used to be Twitter. pic.twitter.com/TdfjO5XIuO 
	And one almost has to admire the scale of the spectacle: Musk spending the GDP of a small country to buy a flashy toy, only to make it crash and burn like a Tesla on Autopliot. There’s a sick thrill in watching him announce a tweak that will never come to pass — eliminating the “block” feature, for instance — and then get into a fight with @Catturd2 over it. He’s laid off thousands, and isn’t above personally firing an engineer who dares to correct him, yet believes X can still be transformed into the “everything app,” integrating payment and shopping services. That stuff is likely to be indefinitely delayed, much as SpaceX‘s long-promised missions to Mars. Who could fail to be entertained by such a saga of self-destruction?

	     	Musk is not without his salesmanship, which, combined with unconditional, breathless hype from supporters, has kept alive the notion of his entrepreneurial and innovative genius. He and this audience are both expending more energy each day on flat denials of grim headlines and vague assurances that X is actually “thriving” like never before. Sooner or later, that magical thinking will run ashore on reality, and until then, yes, the site will survive — but in a state of waking demise, with a user base divided between those cannibalizing what’s left and the stunned spectators. 
	That can hardly be mistaken for a healthy, habitable public forum, let alone an asset that could one day turn a profit. It offers the illusion of life, however, in arguments, abuse, recriminations, and disgust. The paradox of what used to be Twitter is that it is now sustained by little except the mutual contempt of hardened combatants fighting for an inch of territory. Nobody wants to cede the ground.

Tesla CEO tempers expectations, cites 'enormous challenges' in reaching volume production and making the Cybertruck cash-flow positive.","Elon Musk was uncharacteristically cautious about Tesla Inc.’s next big vehicle Wednesday, and his comments may lead some on Wall Street to lower their initial expectations for the Cybertruck. The sci-fi-looking EV that appears as though it would be more at home on the moon or on Musk’s favorite planet, Mars, has already been a source of missed expectations. First unveiled as a prototype in 2019, its production has been repeatedly delayed. Early on in the company’s conference call with analysts and investors Wednesday, Chief Executive Musk said he wanted to emphasize “that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then in making Cybertruck cash-flow positive.” Earlier, Tesla 
        TSLA,
        -1.27%
       reported third-quarter earnings that missed Wall Street’s expectations, and combined with Musk’s comments to “temper expectations,” its stock sank more than 4% in after-hours trading, following an initial rally. Musk may have caused some confusion among investors by his positive tweets Wednesday afternoon that the first Cybertruck deliveries are scheduled for Nov. 30, but then sounded a bit overly cautious about it on the call. He did not say exactly how many Cybertrucks he thought Tesla could produce in the initial ramp this year, and said volume production would not occur until 2025.  One investor asked how many Cybertrucks Tesla may be able to deliver in 2024.  “The more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome,” Musk said. “If you say, ‘well, where will things end up?’ I think we’ll end up with roughly a quarter-million Cybertrucks a year. And I don’t think we’re going to reach that output rate next year. I think we’ll probably reach it sometime in 2025. That’s my best guess.” In its shareholder presentation, in a chart on its factory capacity, Tesla noted that its gigafactory in Texas has a capacity of more than than 125,000 units. But the way Musk was downplaying volume production, it seems unlikely it will hit that number this year, and 2024 is another question.   “This is simply normal,” Musk said. “When you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology, or any brand-new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.” “We dug our own grave for Cybertruck,” Musk added. “Nobody digs graves by themselves and so it is -– Cybertruck is one of those really special products that comes along only once in a long while.” Not only was Musk cautious about the Cybertruck’s timing, he also said he was worried about the effect higher interest rates would have on the car-buying public, as most consumers buy cars on payment plans that accrue interest.  He was vague and did not answer specifically when asked about the company’s current timeline for robotaxis. He proclaimed in 2019 there would be 1 million Tesla robotaxis on the road the next year. He did say that demand for the Cybertruck is “off the charts,” with 1 million people having made reservations. Cybertrucks are beginning to be seen more often in the wild in the San Francisco Bay Area, and one was actually spotted by this columnist on Sunday. It’s worth pointing out that Musk is currently being sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission over his failure to testify to regulators investigating his disclosures concerning his ownership of Twitter stock before his ultimate $44 billion deal to take the social-media company private last year. It’s feasible that, for once, Musk is listening to Tesla’s — or his own — attorneys about the risks of making overzealous predictions. Or he could be concerned that production is going slower than he anticipated.  With Musk, investors never know what kind of shenanigans could potentially be afoot. But it’s always advisable to tread with caution on anything that he says.       Therese Poletti writes the ""Tech Tales"" column for MarketWatch. Follow her on Twitter @tpoletti.

""How detached from reality does the work-from-home crowd have to be? While they take advantage of those who cannot work from home. Why did I sleep in the factory so many times? Because it mattered,"" Musk said, while drawing a comparison between remote workers to factory workers, restaurant workers, and delivery workers. Musk's comments marked an abrupt pivot from a prior discussion about the affordability of Tesla's cars. After sharing his thoughts on remote work, he resumed the pricing discussion by saying, ""So, I just can't emphasize again how important cost is."" Musk has made similar comments about remote work in the past. In May, Musk told CNBC he thought remote work was ""morally wrong,"" and likened remote workers to Marie Antoinette's infamous ""let them eat cake"" remark. The Tesla CEO's push for in-office work could stem from his own workaholic tendencies — like sleeping in the office — according to Walter Isaacson's biography of Musk. His workaholic tendencies were also evident after he acquired Twitter last year — he announced in November that staff were expected to have 40-hour work weeks in the office. The company even transformed some offices into bedrooms, and a former Twitter executive went viral for sleeping on the floor to meet deadlines imposed by Musk. Musk is currently the richest man in the world, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, which estimates his net worth to be $226 billion. During Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday, the company reported third-quarter revenues of $23.35 billion, missing Wall Street expectations of $24.06 billion. Representatives for Musk and Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider, sent outside regular business hours.

Elon Musk today said that X (formerly Twitter) is going to soon launch two new premium tiers, confirming previous reports and code ...","Elon Musk today said that X (formerly Twitter) is going to soon launch two new premium tiers, confirming previous reports and code sightings. The owner of the platform said that one tier will cost lower than the current $8 per month plan, but won’t reduce ads. The other tier will be a more expensive one, which will remove all ads. The current premium plan promises to show “half ads” to subscribers. Musk didn’t mention the prices of these new tiers. Two new tiers of X Premium subscriptions launching soon.  One is lower cost with all features, but no reduction in ads, and the other is more expensive, but has no ads. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 20, 2023  Earlier this month, @aaronp613 found references in X’s code about three separate premium tiers. Separately, Bloomberg also reported that the company is testing multiple paid plans to bring in more revenue. Notably, Meta is said to be thinking about an ad-free tier in response to an EU Court judgment, which says users should have an option for an ad-free tier if they refuse consent for the company to process their data. TikTok also confirmed recently that it is testing an ad-free tier. It’s not clear if X’s move is in response to the EU Court ruling. Musk & co. are trying new ways to increase X’s revenue. Earlier this week, the company started testing a $1 per year plan for new users in New Zealand and the Philippines for basic functionality like posting, liking and reposting. The social network said that this move was to reduce the number of bots on the platform, and wasn’t meant to be “a profit driver.” Earlier this month, Reuters reported that since Musk’s takeover ad revenue has constantly dropped. So it’s not surprising for Musk to make moves to bolster subscription revenue. As the company is trying to attract advertisers with former NBCU exec Linda Yaccarino as CEO, it is trying to publish metrics that look appealing. Earlier this month, Yaccarino said that X has around 245 million daily active users and 500 million daily posts."

In Short · Elon Musk has humorously offered to donate $1 billion to Wikipedia if the free online encyclopedia changes its name to 'Dickipedia' ...","Listen to Story Elon Musk, the man behind SpaceX and Tesla, is making headlines yet again. This time, it's not about a new venture but a playful offer he made to Wikipedia. Musk, known for his regular posts on Twitter, made a rather unusual proposal. He said he'd give Wikipedia a staggering $1 billion, but there was a catch: they had to change their name to “Dickipedia."" Musk known for his tongue in cheek humour claimed it was all in the name of accuracy. As you can imagine, this caught the attention of Twitter users worldwide. One user encouraged Wikipedia to go for it, and Musk added another twist. He said they would have to keep the name for at least a year, and he cheekily remarked, ""I mean, I'm not a fool lol.""
   
Musk even shared a screenshot of Wikipedia's homepage, where it stated, ""Wikipedia is not for sale"" and featured ""a personal appeal from Jimmy Wales."" He questioned why the Wikimedia Foundation needed so much money, considering that Wikipedia's entire text could fit on a smartphone. He left a humorous request to add it to his Wikipedia page. Furthermore, Musk asked if a cow and a poop emoji could be added to his Wikipedia page. This playful banter on Twitter garnered massive attention, with millions of views and likes. Some Twitter users were cautious, noting that Wikipedia often seeks donations, so they might actually try to collect the billion dollars. Others found the whole situation amusing, comparing it to a ""cage match challenge."" There were suggestions to buy Wikipedia and let AI take over the updates, and a few joked about Musk's typical ""rich guy"" move. In a previous incident, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales criticized Musk for censoring critics of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, just before a crucial election. Musk had complied with Turkey's demands to restrict content, which didn't sit well with Wales. He pointed out that Wikipedia had faced a similar situation but had defended freedom of expression, even going to the Supreme Court of Turkey to protect it. Musk's response was, ""The choice is to have Twitter throttled entirely or limit access to some tweets. Which one do you want?""  It's important to note that Wikipedia had been blocked in Turkey for over two years due to the country's regulations allowing the ban of sites deemed obscene or a threat to national security.

Tesla's unconventional electric pickup is about to go into production, according to company CEO Elon Musk. As Ars noted yesterday, Tesla's financial results for the third quarter of 2023 included the news that the company plans to begin deliveries of the Cybertruck at the end of November. But Musk also warned of probable complications ahead as his company tries to scale production. The Cybertruck was first revealed during a chaotic presentation in 2019. It featured an exterior design that looked like it had been sketched with Mars in mind, made from unpainted stainless steel panels like the ill-fated DeLorean DMC12, and allegedly with bulletproof properties, all with a starting price of $39,900. At the time, Musk promised Tesla would reinvent the most quintessentially American vehicle form factor. Instead of body-on-frame construction like the majority of trucks on our roads, or even a unibody construction like the Honda Ridgeline, the Cybertruck was originally going to feature a monocoque body, similar to a Formula 1 car or prototype, except made of folded stainless steel rather than carbon fiber. Musk made much of this at the time, claiming that the body and bed of a conventional truck did nothing useful. ""They are carried like cargo, like a sack of potatoes,"" he said in 2019. Perhaps he regrets those words now; earlier this year, photos of under-construction Cybertrucks at the company's factory in Austin, Texas, revealed stamped steel unibodies waiting to be clad in their unpainted stainless steel potato sacks body panels. There have been plenty of other teething problems during the Cybertruck's four-year gestation. Early trucks had unacceptable noise, vibration, and harshness levels, along with handling flaws and even ""structural shake."" In August, Musk was still concerned, sending an all-hands email to Tesla telling his workers that ""[a]ll parts for this vehicle, whether internal or from suppliers, need to be designed and built to sub 10 micron accuracy. That means all part dimensions need to be to the third decimal place in millimeters and tolerances need to be specified in single digit microns. If LEGO and soda cans, which are very low cost, can do this, so can we."" On yesterday's call with investors, Musk said he wanted to ""temper expectations"" and said that Tesla ""dug our own grave with the Cybertruck."" Tesla's presentation claims an annual production rate of 125,000 Cybertrucks, and on the call, Musk said he thought that the company could build 250,000 Cybertrucks annually in Texas, although not until 2025. ""I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck and then making the Cybertruck cashflow positive—this is simply normal,"" Musk said. Indeed, Tesla has repeatedly gone through what Musk terms ""production hell"" when trying to scale production. Whether demand exists for that many Cybertrucks remains to be proven. Electric pickups from other brands are barely making a dent in America's enormous appetite for big trucks, and debate currently rages among those who track these things. Are high sales prices and limited towing ranges turning off potential buyers? Or are production problems and therefore minimal supplies to blame? Anecdotes are growing about unsold Ford F-150 Lightnings on dealer lots, and General Motors' ongoing inability to make Ultium battery cells at anything approaching scale has kept the gargantuan Hummer EV's deliveries at a relative trickle. Right now, Rivian appears to be the market leader—with 14,374 R1Ts delivered during the first three quarters of 2023, it beat Ford's cheaper F-150 by more than 2,000 units. As for the Tesla, unlike its other four models, the plus-sized Cybertruck has little appeal to drivers in Europe or China, and that promised sub-$40,000 price promise evaporated last year. Currently, the Tesla Cybertruck page has no pricing other than a $100 deposit and no way to configure a truck.

		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Grimes is suing her ex Elon Musk over a matter involving their three children. Born Claire Boucher, the “Genesis” performer filed a “petition to establish parental relationship” on Sept. 29 in a California court, court records obtained by Page Six show. The request intends to have the court identify the legal parents of a child when they are unmarried. Although the docket for the case is public, the filings have been sealed; however, it does not appear that the Tesla co-founder has responded to Grimes’ petition. She also has yet to request child support or custody rights. Grimes, 35, and Musk, 52, began dating in 2018 and had an on-again, off-again relationship until September 2021 when they split for good. The Canadian artist gave birth to their firstborn, a son named X Æ A-Xii, in May 2020, and the former couple went on to quietly welcome daughter Exa Dark Sideræl, aka Y, via surrogate in December 2021. In September, journalist Walter Isaacson’s “Elon Musk” biography revealed the SpaceX founder and Grimes secretly had a third child, a boy named Techno Mechanicus, whom they have affectionally dubbed Tau. It’s unclear when Tau was born. Grimes’ petition comes just weeks after she pleaded on Twitter with Musk to allow her to see their son. For more Page Six you love … In response to Isaacson’s tweet sharing photos of the billionaire’s twins, Strider and Azure, whom he shares with Shivon Zilis, the “Oblivion” singer wrote in a since-deleted tweet, “Tell Shivon to unblock me and tell Elon to let me see my son or plz respond to my lawyer. “I have never even been allowed to see a photo of these children until this moment, despite the situation utterly ripping my family apart.” Days later, Grimes explained on the same platform that she had connected with Zilis, 37, to “de-escalate” the feud. “I spoke with Shivon at length finally, which was long overdue. This wasn’t her fault, plz don’t be angry at her!” she began her missive. “We respect each other a lot and we’re excited to become friends and have the kids grow up together.” Zilis responded to the musician, saying it “all ended up for the best.” Musk, who is a father of 11 and has been divorced three times, and Zilis secretly welcomed their twins in November 2021 following his split from Grimes, though news of the newborns did not surface until eight months later.

Elon Musk says SpaceX is ready for Starship's next flight. In a new keynote, he talked about what's next, and how SpaceX will ready for Mars ...","When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. 'If the engines light and the ship doesn't blow itself up … I think we've got a decent chance of reaching orbit.' SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says he's hopeful Starship doesn't blow up on its second spaceflight attempt. Elon Musk spoke about Starship, a huge SpaceX reusable rocket system aiming for a new near-orbital flight in the near future, in a keynote address on Thursday (Oct. 5) at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Baku, Azerbaijan. Speaking with moderator and Voyager Space chief revenue officer Clay Mowry, Musk said via video that SpaceX does not want to ""set expectations too high"" after an explosive orbital attempt in April. That effort saw Starship's two stages fail to separate, among other issues; SpaceX ultimately deliberately detonated the vehicle high above the Gulf of Mexico. Musk, 52, eventually hopes to use Starship to send people to the moon and Mars in line with his decades-long goal of reaching the Red Planet with SpaceX, which was founded in 2002.  Starship and its Super Heavy booster are the most powerful rocket system ever built, having nearly twice the liftoff thrust of NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket designed for the Artemis program; SLS is the brawniest launcher currently in use until Starship is ready for operational flights.  A big contract deadline is coming, however: Starship has been tasked by NASA to land the Artemis 3 crew on the moon in 2025 or 2026 in the first such attempt by humans since Apollo 17 in 1972. Related: SpaceX celebrated Starship's 1st launch. Some locals called it 'truly terrifying'   Delays in getting Starship ready in recent months caused NASA officials to say multiple times that they are keeping an eye on SpaceX's progress. Jim Free, the agency's associate administrator of the exploration systems development mission directorate, said in early August there is still time for SpaceX to meet NASA's Artemis 3 guidelines. But if not, he said, the agency is prepared to fly a non-landing mission for Artemis 3 and to delay the lunar touchdown to at least Artemis 4. We don't know when Starship will fly again. Musk said in early May that the system would be ready for a new flight in ""six to eight weeks"". This summer, his company also did dramatic engine fires of Starship to prepare for the next flight. But the  U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) cautioned in late September that the required regulatory processes for addressing issues on the first flight is not yet complete.  While SpaceX said it has implemented all 57 actions required for the next flight and completed its investigation, the FAA has not yet awarded a license for the second launch. SpaceX also needs to receive environmental approval from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, according to Reuters. Once these key items are taken care of, however, SpaceX will likely launch quickly. Musk has also said that Starship is ready to go, from a technical standpoint. Related: SpaceX's giant Starship vehicle towers above turquoise waters in gorgeous photo  Flight 2, as Musk calls the upcoming Starship launch, will include key changes SpaceX recently implemented to Starship. For example: The company aims to ""hot stage"" the system, meaning that Starship will light its second-stage engines before the vehicle's two stages have fully separated. While the Soviet Union made use of hot staging before, Musk said it's the first time SpaceX will attempt it. ""I'd say that's the riskiest part of the flight,"" he said. ""If the engines light and the ship doesn't blow itself up during staging, then I think we've got a decent chance of reaching orbit."" Presuming that happens according to plan, Starship will make less than a complete orbit of Earth and splash down in the Pacific off the coast of Hawaii, he said. The next key test in-flight will be the heat shield, so far untested. ""We think it will work, but we aren't sure if it will work,"" Musk said of the heat shield. ""So if it doesn't work, we want it to not work over the Pacific — which is a large body of water with almost no people on it."" Related: SpaceX to launch next Starship test flight 'soon,' Elon Musk says (photos) The current version of Starship, Musk said, produces about twice the thrust of the powerful NASA Saturn V rocket that brought Apollo program astronauts to the moon in the 1960s and 1970s. ""With the upgrades that we have in the works, it'll do about three times the thrust,"" he said. In real terms, Starship now produces 16 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, and SpaceX is aiming for 20 million pounds in the near term, after future engine upgrades. More changes will also come with reusability, Musk said. Pending when licenses are granted, launch tower upgrades to the access arms to catch the returning Super Heavy booster's first stage from mid-air could be available ""within the next year, or maybe less than a year."" As for Starship itself: ""If we get lucky, we might catch the ship towards the end of next year,"" Musk said. The ""absurd size"" of the 394-foot-tall (120 meters) Starship and Super Heavy stack supports Musk's eventual crew destination: The Red Planet. The goal is ""to build something that is capable of creating a permanent base on the moon, and a city on Mars. That's why it is so large. Otherwise we can make it much smaller,"" he said. Musk is aiming for a Martian touchdown without a crew ""within the next four years,"" although he cautioned the goal was only ""sort of feasible."" And there's more to come after that: The propulsion system of Starship ""should, to generalize, be able to land anywhere on a solid surface anywhere in the solar system,"" Musk said.  Dust would present one of the biggest challenges for a moon landing, but assuming Starship can handle that, only ""minor modifications"" would be required for destinations such as Mars, the asteroid belt, and the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn, Musk said. He added these far-flung destinations could host propellant plants to fuel future space exploration, using resources such as water ice. Related: 'We need to get to Mars before I die.' Read exclusive excerpt from 'Elon Musk' by biographer Walter Isaacson  The company is also looking to reuse other elements of its space systems as much as possible, including using its Earth-orbiting broadband satellite Starlink system for laser communications at Mars, as well as recycling elements of the SpaceX spacesuit in use for astronaut missions.  Currently the spacesuit is used for the interiors of spacecraft only, but upgrades (which Musk did not specify) will allow for an extravehicular activity or spacewalk outside Starship during the Polaris Dawn mission, the first of three flights in billionaire Jared Isaacman's self-directed space program. (Isaacman is paying for these missions, in addition to Inspiration4, which flew himself and three others on SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon in 2021.) Then there's also lunar rovers, which could be modified from existing cars made by Tesla, Musk's car company. ""The nice thing about electric cars is that they obviously do not require oxygen,"" said Musk, who is also founder and CEO of Tesla. ""I think Tesla could easily make a car, like a Cybertruck 'luna variant.' Just get the IP [intellectual property] or get the 'moon option' package,"" he said. SpaceX will generate revenue streams for Starship development through its other missions, including periodic Starlink launches (a version 3 is expected next year), its International Space Station launches of astronauts and cargo, satellite launches for customers such as the U.S. Space Force, and (Musk disclosed) an approximately 26-foot (8 m) space telescope for the University of California, Berkeley that may itself use Starship. This revenue is not counting other crewed launches of Starship further in the future. Isaacman plans to conclude his three-mission Polaris Program with Starship, while other billionaires and space tourists such as Yusaku Maezawa and Dennis Tito plan separate moon ventures with the system.

Within four or five years, he predicted, it's possible SpaceX could have a ""greenfield location"" for Starship at nearby Cape Canaveral (where it already launches its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets) capable of launching several times daily. ""Then we may need to go to an ocean-based platform, just if you're launching 10 times a day. That might be a bit much even for the Cape, I don't know,"" he continued. ""But we may end up doing platform-based launches from a specially designed sort of oceangoing platform. But we will need to do a lot of launches. We're talking about thousands of launches per year."" Musk said the incredible launch rate would be necessary to send over 100,000 tons of cargo per year to orbit, which he said is ""still not quite enough"" for his dreams of Mars exploration that would require ""roughly a million tons"" per year. (For perspective, the workhorse Falcon 9 rocket sends about 1,500 to 1,600 tons to orbit per year, which Musk said is roughly 80% of Earth's annual launching mass to orbit. He hopes to boost that to 2,500 tons next year.) ""Either we do that, or we're a single-planet species forever,"" Musk said. ""We achieve those kinds of numbers, or we will never have a self-sustaining city on Mars."" Those who remain on Earth could perhaps use Starship in other ways, Musk hinted, such as a fast way of moving people or cargo between continents on our planet, which he suggested may work out cost-wise as Starship uses low-cost liquid methane propellant. Further cost savings may be realized from eliminating pilots (as the system would be autonomous) and even items like bathrooms, given that passengers would only need half an hour on board to get to their destination. ""It really comes down to a question of, is it economically viable compared to long-distance aircraft? And I think our back-of-the envelope numbers suggest that it actually has a shot,"" he said.

A picture of Ben Brody, 22, began circulating on social media, accusing him of being involved in a brawl between right-wing extremist groups ...","Elon Musk, the owner of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, is being sued by a recent college graduate who says Musk falsely accused him of being affiliated with a neo-Nazi group. 
Ben Brody, 22, is suing Musk for libel, saying Musk amplified posts on X that wrongly identified Brody as a participant in a brawl between two right-wing extremist groups during a Pride event in Portland, Ore., on June 24. 
""Over the past several years, Musk has settled into a consistent pattern of making reckless false statements to the detriment of innocent third parties while fostering disinformation and denying neo-Nazi violence,"" the lawsuit alleges. It was filed Monday in the district court of Travis County, Texas. 
A lawyer for Musk did not respond to a request for comment. 
Under his ownership, conspiratorial narratives rapidly gain audiences on X.   Back in June, members of the Proud Boys and the Rose City Nationalists were at the Portland event to ""vent their bigotry and intimidate Pride Night celebrants,"" the complaint says. 
But the groups got into a fight amongst themselves. Video of the brawl quickly went viral, and right wing social media influencers began accusing the Rose City Nationalists of being federal agents or left-wing antagonists there to influence public opinion of the groups. In the video, two Rose City Nationalists had their masks torn off. 
Brody was accused of being one of the unmasked men. 
An anonymous account tweeted screenshots of a man's face in the video, accompanied by a picture of Brody, taken from an Instagram post by his college fraternity, Alpha Epsilon Pi, which refers to itself as ""the world's Jewish college fraternity."" 
As a person with Jewish heritage, being accused of being a neo-Nazi ""would be utterly profane and blasphemous if it were true,"" the suit says. 
Musk asked in a Twitter post, ""Who were the unmasked individuals?"" to which another user copied the post accusing Brody of being a participant. 
""Very odd,"" Musk responded. 
Brody, who lives in Los Angeles County, Calif., posted an Instagram video trying to absolve himself, as well as debit card receipts showing he was in California the day of the Portland brawl. He also contacted one of the stores he patronized that day for video footage, the complaint says. 
Many X users began telling Musk that it was not Brody in the video. Under another post sharing Brody's picture, Musk commented, ""Always remove their masks."" 
On June 27, Musk tweeted a reply in reference to the unmasked men in the video: ""Looks like one is a college student (who wants to join the govt) and another is maybe an Antifa member, but nonetheless a probable false flag situation."" 
""False flag"" is a term used in military contexts, but it's also often used by conspiracists to refer to actions carried out to purposely pin the blame on another party. 
Musk's June 27 tweet has been viewed more than 1.2 million times. Musk's tweets remain up. He has refused to retract his accusations, the lawsuit says.   ""Musk's personal endorsement of the false accusation against Ben Brody reverberated across the internet, transforming the accusation from anonymous rumor to gospel truth for many individuals, and causing others to use Musk's endorsement to justify their desire to harass Ben Brody and his family,"" the lawsuit says. 
""Ben spent the following days and weeks in a cycle of panic, fear, denial, disorientation, and depression,"" it says. 
Brody also had trouble sleeping, panic attacks, headaches and fatigue that interfered with his daily life, the suit says. 
""Ben was put through intense terror because of Musk's recklessness, and now Ben finds himself depressed, freaked out, and mentally distraught right at the crucial personal moment when he exits college and enters his career path,"" the complaint adds. 
Brody worries about the availability of job opportunities in the future and being confronted by conspiracy theorists. 
He's seeking damages of at least $1 million, a jury trial and a judgment clearing his name, the lawsuit says. 
""The reality is that too many powerful people with enormous audiences are being reckless with their accusations against private people,"" the complaint says. ""The damage they cause is not easily repaired by apologies or counter-speech, no matter how persuasive.""

CNN By Brian Fung and Donie O’Sullivan, CNN (CNN) — European officials warned X on Tuesday that the company formerly known as Twitter appears to have been hosting misinformation and illegal content about the war between Hamas and Israel, in potential violation of the European Union’s signature content moderation law. In a letter addressed to X owner Elon Musk, Thierry Breton, a top European commissioner, said X faces “very precise obligations regarding content moderation” and that the company’s handling of the unfolding conflict so far has raised doubts about its compliance.  As a platform subject to Europe’s Digital Services Act (DSA), X could face billions in fines if regulators conclude that violations have occurred. X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The warning letter highlights X’s potentially vast legal exposure as it battles a wave of bogus claims linked to the war that have been attributed to everything from fake White House press releases to false news reports and out-of-context videos from unrelated conflicts or even video games. Much of the problematic content appears to stem from platform changes made under Musk’s supervision, Breton suggested in the letter, which he shared on X. For example, he wrote, X announced over the weekend that it was making it easier for accounts to qualify for newsworthiness exceptions to its platform rules. The change to X’s Public Interest Policy made it so that accounts no longer require a minimum of 100,000 followers to qualify; they need only be “high profile” accounts that, as before, represent current or potential government officials, political parties or political candidates.  Removing the follower threshold and replacing it with a celebrity standard leaves it “uncertain” what content, particularly “violent and terrorist content that appears to circulate on your platform,” will be removed, Breton wrote. Under the DSA, which became enforceable for large platforms in August, companies must also act swiftly when officials highlight content that violates European laws, which X may not be doing, Breton warned. “We have, from qualified sources, reports about potentially illegal content circulating on your service despite flags from relevant authorities,” Breton wrote. “I remind you that following the opening of a potential investigation and a finding of non-compliance, penalties can be imposed,” he added.  In an exchange on X, Musk replied to Breton. “Our policy is that everything is open source and transparent, an approach that I know the EU supports,” Musk wrote. “Please list the violations you allude to on X, so that that the public can see them.” Breton posted back: “You are well aware of your users’ — and authorities’— reports on fake content and glorification of violence. Up to you to demonstrate that you walk the talk. My team remains at your disposal to ensure DSA compliance, which the EU will continue to enforce rigorously.” The EU letter comes as misinformation about the conflict continues to spread widely across X.  On Tuesday, the investigative journalism group Bellingcat said a fake video designed to look like a BBC News report was circulating on social media. The video falsely claimed Bellingcat found evidence that Ukraine had smuggled weapons to Hamas. Elliot Higgins, the founder of Bellingcat, said the report was “100% fake.” In an effort to make the video look like a real BBC News report, its creators used graphics almost identical to what the BBC uses in its own online video reports. The video circulated on Telegram and was shared by at least one verified account on X. X did not remove the fake BBC News video, but it did append a small label under the video noting it is “manipulated media.” In response to a question about the fake video, a BBC spokesperson said, “In a world of increasing disinformation, we urge everyone to ensure they are getting news from a trusted source.”  Shayan Sardarizadeh, a BBC News reporter, wrote on X Tuesday, “The video is 100% fake.” Since taking over, Musk has laid off large swaths of X’s content moderation and policy teams, prompting backlash from civil society groups, which have warned about an increased threat of misinformation and hate speech.  In what he called an effort to deter the creation of automated accounts, Musk also eliminated the traditional verification badges that once reassured users of an account’s authenticity, replacing it with a paid system that has allowed any user to receive a verification badge without undergoing an identity check. Misinformation experts have said that the move undermined users’ ability to determine the credibility of any given account, particularly during a fast-moving news event.  But Musk himself has directly contributed to the chaos, at one point sharing – and then deleting – a post recommending that users follow an account that has been known to share misinformation, including a fake report earlier this year of an explosion at the Pentagon.

Kompaniya xaritalar, yo'nalishlar va sariq sahifalar bilan gazeta sanoati uchun Internet-shahar qo'llanmasini ishlab chiqdi va sotdi. Maskning aytishicha, kompaniya muvaffaqiyatli bo'lishidan oldin u kvartirani sotib ololmagan va uning o'rniga ofisni ijaraga olgan, divanda uxlagan, ymcada dush qabul qilgan va akasi bilan bitta kompyuterni baham ko'rgan. U va Kimbal biznes qarorlari bo'yicha kelisha olmaganlarida, ular o'zaro kelishmovchiliklarni kurash orqali hal qilishdi. Maskning so'zlariga ko'ra,""sayt kunduzi ishlagan, men esa uni kechasi, haftada etti kun, har doim loyihalashtirganman"". Aka-uka Musklar The New York Times va Chicago Tribune bilan shartnoma tuzdilar va direktorlar kengashini citysearch bilan birlashish rejalaridan voz kechishga ko'ndirdi. Maskning direktorlar kengashi raisi Rich Sorkin lavozimini egallagan bosh direktor bo'lishga urinishlari direktorlar kengashi tomonidan to'xtatildi. Compaq 1999-yil fevral oyida Zip2-ni 307 million dollarga naqd pulga sotib oldi va Musk o'zining 7 foiz ulushi uchun 22 million dollar oldi. 
1999 yil mart oyida Musk asoschilaridan biri bo'ldi X.com. 2000 yilda X.com u Confinity kompaniyasi bilan birlashdi, uning mahsulotlaridan biri PayPal shaxsiy pul o'tkazmalari xizmati edi. Mask kompaniya tomonidan ishlab chiqilgan dasturiy ta'minotni Unix-dan Windows operatsion tizimiga o'tkazishni qat'iy qo'llab-quvvatladi, bu esa kompaniyaning texnik direktori Maks Levchin va boshqa rahbarlar bilan kelishmovchiliklarni keltirib chiqardi, bu esa Maskning bosh direktor lavozimidan iste'foga chiqishi bilan yakunlandi (shu bilan birga u direktorlar kengashi a'zosi bo'lib qoldi). Biroq, ilonning ikki kompaniyani birlashtirish to'g'risidagi strategik qarori, Internet-auksionlarda (birinchi navbatda eBay) elektron to'lov tizimini faol targ'ib qilish bilan birga, 2001 yilda PayPal deb nomlangan korxonaning tez o'sishiga olib keldi. Bunday ta'sirchan muvaffaqiyatlar kompaniyaga 2002 yil fevral oyida aksiyalarni birjada joylashtirishga imkon berdi (va shu bilan birga, 2001 yil 11 sentabrdagi terrorchilik harakatlaridan keyin birjaga chiqqan dot-com kompaniyalaridan birinchisi bo'ldi). 2002 yil oktyabr oyida PayPal eBay tomonidan 1,5 milliard AQSh dollariga sotib olingan. Mask sotilganda kompaniyaning 11,7 foiz aksiyalariga egalik qilgan, bu esa unga 180 million dollar daromad olish imkonini bergan. 
Teslaning sho'ba korxonasi bo'lgan Kaliforniyaning San-Mateo shahrida joylashgan Amerika quyosh panellarini ishlab chiqaruvchi energiya kompaniyasi. 
San-Frantsiskoda joylashgan sun'iy intellekt bo'yicha notijorat tadqiqot kompaniyasi. Kompaniyaning maqsadi ochiq, do'stona Aini rivojlantirishdir. Asoschilaridan biri elon Musk. 
2018 yil 20 fevralda elon Musk manfaatlar to'qnashuvi sababli Open AI direktorlar kengashidan iste'foga chiqdi. 
„Tesla“ kompaniyasining bosh ijrochi direktori Elon Musk va moliyaviy direktori Zach Kirkhornning maqomi oʻzgardi. Muskning yangi maqomini „Texnologiya qiroli“, Kirkhornnikini esa „Tangalar hukmdori“ deb tarjima qilish mumkin. Shunga qaramay, Elon va Zach bosh direktor hamda moliya direktori lavozimlarini saqlab qoladi[13]. 
Amerika kompaniyasi, elektr avtomobil ishlab chiqaruvchisi va (SolarCity filiali orqali) elektr energiyasini saqlash echimlari. 2018 yil mart oyida kompaniya aktsiyadorlari ilon Maskning ish haqini yiliga 3 milliard dollarga oshirish uchun ovoz berishdi. U qat'iy ish haqiga ega bo'lmaydi, aksincha kompaniya aktsiyalari shaklida kompensatsiya oladi. Kompensatsiyani to'lash kompaniyaning kerakli moliyaviy ko'rsatkichlarga erishishiga bog'liq bo'ladi. 
2019-yil oktabr oyida elon Musk Tesla daromad keltirganini va kompaniya aktsiyalari kotirovkalari 20 foizga ko'tarilganini e'lon qildi. 
2016 yilda Musk neuralink kompaniyasiga asos solgan bo'lib, u inson miyasini sun'iy intellekt (AI) bilan birlashtirishga qaratilgan neyrotexnologiya startapi bo'lib, uning mashinalar bilan birlashishini osonlashtirish uchun inson miyasiga o'rnatilgan qurilmalarni yaratish orqali. Qurilmalar, shuningdek, dolzarb bo'lib qolish uchun sun'iy intellektning so'nggi yaxshilanishlariga mos keladi. Bunday yaxshilanishlar xotirani yaxshilashi yoki qurilmalarga dasturiy ta'minot bilan yanada samarali muloqot qilish imkonini berishi mumkin[46]. 
2020-yil avgust oyida jonli namoyishda Musk o'zining dastlabki qurilmalaridan birini ""Bosh suyagingizdagi Fitbit"" deb ta'rifladi, u tez orada falaj, karlik, ko'rlik va boshqa kasalliklarni davolay oladi. Ko'plab nevrologlar va nashrlar bu da'volarni tanqid qilishdi; MIT Technology Review ularni ""juda spekulyativ"" va ""nevrologiya teatri""deb atadi. 
Infratuzilma va tunnel qurish bilan shug'ullanadigan qurilish kompaniyasi elon Musk tomonidan 2016 yilda tashkil etilgan. 
Avtomobillar uchun metro: kelajakda soatiga 240 km tezlikda harakatlanish mumkin bo'ladi.Maskning fikricha, u an'anaviy metroga qaraganda ancha arzon, tezroq va qulayroq bo'ladi va shahar tirbandligiga qarshi kurashda yordam berishi kerak. Los-Anjeles okrugida 1,83 km sinov tunneli 2018 yil 19 dekabrda ochilgan. 
2022-yil 14-mart holatiga ko'ra, ilon Mask Twitter'ning 9,2 foiz aksiyalari (73,48 million aksiya) egasi bo'lgan. Paketning qiymati 1 apreldagi birja qiymati bo'yicha 2,8 milliard dollardan oshdi, Maskning 9,2 foiz aksiyalarini sotib olganligi haqidagi yangiliklar fonida Twitter aktsiyalari premarketda 25 foizdan oshdi. 2022 yil 25 aprelda Twitter direktorlar kengashi Maskning kompaniyani 44 milliard dollarga sotib olish taklifini qabul qildi. Iyun oyida Musk bitimdan voz kechdi, chunki Twitter soxta akkauntlar haqida ma'lumot berish uchun ""ko'p so'rovlarga javob bera olmadi yoki rad etdi"". 2022-yil avgust oyida Delaver kansler sudi Twitter'ga ijtimoiy tarmoqdagi botlar va spam akkauntlar ulushini hisoblash bo'yicha qo'shimcha hujjatlarni ilon Maskga topshirishni buyurdi. 
2022-yil 11-oktabrda ilon Mask Twitter-ni dalillarni yo'q qilgani uchun jazolashni talab qildi. Tadbirkorning fikriga ko'ra, ijtimoiy tarmoq rahbariyati ishdan bo'shatilgan xavfsizlik direktori Piter Zatkoni kompaniya rahbariyati tomonidan yo'l qo'yilgan qoidabuzarliklar to'g'risidagi ma'lumotlarni o'z ichiga olgan yozuvlarni yo'q qilishga majbur qildi. 2022-yil 28-oktabrda Musk bitimni yopdi va kompaniyani boshqardi. Bloomberg ma'lumotlariga ko'ra, 2022-yil noyabr oyida kompaniya ommaviy qisqartirishlardan o'tdi Mask kompaniya xodimlarining 50 foizini qisqartirishni rejalashtirgan.The Verge nashri ma'lumotlariga ko'ra, ilon Mask kompaniya xodimlarini 7,5 ming xodimdan 2,7 mingga qisqartirgan. Ommaviy qisqartirishdan so'ng, yangi xodimlarni, asosan dasturiy ta'minot va savdo bo'limi bilan bog'liq xodimlarni jalb qilish boshlandi. 
2022-yil 15-dekabrda elon Musk biznesmenning parvozlari haqidagi ma'lumotlarni e'lon qilgan akkaunt egasini sudga bergani ma'lum bo'ldi. Shuningdek, multimilliarderning ta'kidlashicha, odamlarning qaerdaligini oshkor qiladigan hisoblar bloklanadi, chunki bu odamlarga tahdid soladi. 
2022-yil 19-dekabrda Maks Twitter'da kompaniya rahbari lavozimidan ketishi kerakmi yoki yo'qmi degan so'rovnomani boshladi. Ishtirokchilarning 57,5 foizi iste'foga chiqish uchun ovoz berdi. 42,5% qarshi chiqdi. So'rovda jami 17,5 milliondan ortiq kishi ishtirok etdi. Musk qanday qaror qabul qilishi noma'lum, ammo u ""so'rov natijalariga sodiq qolishini""va'da qilgan. 20-dekabr kuni CNBC Maskning voris topish rejalari haqida xabar berdi. 
2023 yil 5 iyun kuni ""Twitter"" bosh direktori lavozimini tark etdi, avvalroq u ijrochi rais va texnik direktor lavozimida qolishini aytdi. 
2023 yilning bahorida Musk chatgpt chatbotiga raqobatbardosh muqobil yaratish rejalari haqida xabar berdi, buning uchun xAI kompaniyasi tashkil etildi, uning ishga tushirilishi 2023 yil iyul oyida e'lon qilindi. 
2021-yil 7-yanvarda ilon Mask Amazon asoschisi Jeff Bezosni ikkinchi o'ringa olib chiqib, sayyoradagi eng boy odamga aylandi. Maskning boyligi o'sha paytda 185 milliard dollarga baholangan edi. 2021-yil 19-fevralda uning boyligi 199,9 milliard dollarga yetdi va u yana dunyoning eng boy odamiga aylandi va 17-fevralda birinchi o'ringa qaytgan asoschisi Jeff Bezosni (194,2 milliard dollar) ortda qoldirdi. 
2021-yil 3-oktabrdagi Real vaqt rejimidagi milliarderlar boyligi reytinglarida Mask Bloomberg ma'lumotlariga ko'ra 209 milliard dollar va Forbes ma'lumotlariga ko'ra 199 milliard dollar boyligi bilan birinchi o'rinni egalladi. 
2021-yil 1-noyabrda Tesla aktsiyalari kotirovkalari o'sishi fonida Maskning hozirgi holati 300 milliard dollardan oshdi, bu esa tarixda boyligi shu darajaga yetgan birinchi odam bo'ldi[4]. Shundan so'ng u Twitter foydalanuvchilari o'rtasida ovoz berib, soliqlarni to'lash uchun Tesla kompaniyasining 10 foiz ulushini sotishi kerakmi, deb so'radi. Buning sababi shundaki, demokrat senator Ron Uayden eng badavlat kishilarga sotilmagan foyda deb ataladigan daromaddan 23,8% to'lashni, ya'ni qimmatli qog'ozlar qiymatining o'sishini, ular o'z aktivlarining bir qismini sotganmi yoki yo'qmi, to'lashni taklif qildi. Ushbu qonun loyihasi ilgari surilishidan oldin ham Musk 6 milliard dollarlik aktsiyalarning bir qismini sotish va barcha pullarni BMTning Jahon oziq-ovqat dasturiga berish niyatida ekanligini aytdi (agar uning rahbariyati mablag'larning qanday sarflanishida ko'proq shaffoflikni namoyon etsa). So'rov ishtirokchilarining aksariyati savdo-sotiqni qo'llab-quvvatladilar va Musk o'z aktsiyalarini taxminan 5 milliard dollarga sotdi. 
14 dekabrda elon Musk Forbes versiyasi bo'yicha sayyoramizning eng boy odamlari reytingida birinchi o'rinni yo'qotib, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy prezidenti Bernard Arno va uning oilasiga mag'lub bo'ldi. Jurnal ma'lumotlariga ko'ra, Maskning boyligi 176,8 milliard dollarga, Janob Arno esa 188,6 milliard dollarga baholanmoqda. 
2022-yilda Musk 122,6 milliard dollar yo'qotdi, bu uning 2021-yilda ishlab topgan miqdoridan ko'proqdir. 
2023-yil 1-iyun holatiga ko'ra, Bloomberg Billionaires Index reytingiga ko'ra, biznesmenning boyligi 192 milliard dollarni tashkil etadi.elon Musk yana Bloomberg tomonidan dunyodagi eng boy odamlar ro'yxatida birinchi o'rinni egalladi. 
2016 yil dekabr oyida strategiya va siyosat bo'yicha Prezident forumi (ingl.) rus tili. AQSh prezidenti Donald Tramp davrida 16 nafar amerikalik tadbirkorlardan iborat guruh bo'lib, ularning vazifasi AQShning 45-prezidentiga iqtisodiy o'sish, yangi ish o'rinlari yaratish va mehnat unumdorligini oshirish bilan bog'liq masalalar bo'yicha maslahat berishdir[73][74], lekin 2017 yilda forumda ishtirok etishdan bosh tortdi. Trampning AQShni Parij kelishuvidan chiqarish to'g'risidagi qaroriga norozilik bildirdi[75] [76]. 
2020-yil 24-iyulda elon Musk tvit qoldirdi: ""yana bir rag'batlantiruvchi davlat paketlari odamlar manfaati uchun emas""[77]. Bunga javoban Mask Armani vakilidan Tesla batareyalarini ishlab chiqarish uchun juda zarur bo'lgan lityum konlarini nazorat qilish maqsadida AQShning Boliviyada davlat to'ntarishini tashkil qilishi odamlarning manfaatlariga mos kelmasligi haqida xabar oldi. O'z navbatida, Musk e'tiroz bildirdi: ""biz xohlagan joyda to'ntarishlar qilamiz! Buni qabul qiling "" [78]. 
2022-yilda Rossiya Ukrainaga bostirib kirganidan so'ng, Musk Ukrainani va urushga qarshi bo'lgan ruslarni ochiqchasiga qo'llab-quvvatladi[79][80]. Hujumdan ko'p o'tmay, Musk Ukrainaga Starlink sun'iy yo'ldosh Internet tizimiga kirish huquqini berdi va mamlakatga Starlink terminallarining ikkita partiyasini, batareyalarni, avtomobil zajigalka quvvat adapterlarini, quyosh panellarini va generatorlarni yubordi[79][81]. 2022-yil oktabr oyida u tez orada Rossiyaning Ukraina bilan tinchligini qo'llab-quvvatladi[82] va mumkin bo'lgan sulhning to'rtta parametrini nomladi: 
1.BMT nazorati ostida Zaporojye, Xerson, Donetsk va Lugansk viloyatlarining Rossiya tomonidan bosib olingan qismlarida yangi referendumlar o'tkazish 
2.Rossiya tomonidan Qrimning anneksiyasini tan olish 
3.Ukrainaning neytral maqomi 
4.Qrimni suv bilan ta'minlash kafolatlangan 
2022-yil 21-oktabrda Bloomberg oq uyda Maskning korxonalari va faoliyatini mamlakat milliy xavfsizligiga tahdid borligini tekshirish imkoniyati muhokama qilinayotganini ma'lum qildi. Buning sabablari orasida, jumladan, ""bir qator tvitlardan keyin Rossiyaga nisbatan tobora do'stona munosabat""deb ataladi. 
2022 yil oktyabr oyida Tayvanning Xitoydan mustaqilligini tan olmagan holda Tayvanni Xitoyning maxsus iqtisodiy zonasiga aylantirishni taklif qildi.  "

The Wall Street regulator is investigating potential violations of U.S. securities laws regarding Musk's deal to acquire Twitter, now X.","The Securities and Exchange Commission is suing Elon Musk in a bid to compel him to testify in a probe into his 2022 purchase of Twitter, the company now known as X, the agency said Thursday. The Wall Street regulator is investigating potential violations of U.S. securities laws regarding Musk's $44 billion deal to acquire Twitter as well as his statements and SEC filings about the company, the agency said in a filing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The investigation is ongoing and has not concluded that any laws were violated, the SEC added in a related release. Musk and the SEC have regularly clashed over the last decade, with the Twitter deal the latest flashpoint between the two. Last month, Musk failed to appear to testify after four months' notice, according to the SEC. The sides had an agreed-upon date, but two days beforehand, Musk canceled, ""raising, for the first time, several spurious objections,"" the SEC said. Alex Spiro, an attorney representing Musk, said in an email: “The SEC has already taken Mr. Musk’s testimony multiple times in this misguided investigation - enough is enough.” The SEC stated in the order that Musk objected to questions about why the agency needed him to testify again, the location of the testimony and the fact that a biography about the billionaire came out in September that his lawyers needed time to review. “None of Musk’s objections has any legal validity, and he has no justifiable excuse for his non-compliance with the SEC’s subpoena,” the agency wrote in the order. The tensions between the SEC and Musk date back to the Tesla CEO’s tweets in 2018 discussing a deal to take the electric car manufacturer private at $420 per share. Soon after, the SEC filed and settled fraud charges against Musk — leading to his ouster as Tesla chair and a $20 million penalty. Musk later in the year went on the ""60 Minutes"" television show to declare he does “not respect the SEC.” Musk recently lost a courtroom fight over the terms of the settlement, though Spiro has said he plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. Speeding, airborne Dodge Charger hit by a city bus destroys a restaurant. Luckily, the restaurant was closed and no one was killed. The National Transportation Safety Board, a U.S. government agency that investigates such accidents, found that in this scenario and many others like it, a technology that limits the speed of vehicles could have mitigated the scale of this tragedy.  The driver, who was found to have cocaine and PCP in his system which impaired his decision-making, had a record for breaking the speed limit.  The NTSB concluded that intelligent speed-assist technology (ISA) should be standard equipment in all new vehicles to prevent needless deaths. Given that Ohtani has offered remarkably few indications of his current preferences, we can only broadly speculate as to what might sway his ultimate decision beyond money — which might not even be the biggest factor.

Activision's CEO Bobby Kotick recently hosted an all-hands internal meeting at the firm. Sitting down with James Corden of Gavin and Stacey ...","When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Kotick and Corden (not me) discuss the future of Activision. Microsoft is in the process of acquiring Activision-Blizzard-King (ABK), known for games like Diablo, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and of course, Call of Duty.  The Xbox-ABK deal valued at 72 billion dollars would give Xbox control over some of the world's biggest and most nostalgic franchises. While facing intense regulatory scrutiny around the world, Microsoft emphasized that the deal is designed around competing with Apple and Google on mobile devices, whose store platforms enjoy a near-total global duopoly over mobile gaming payments and distribution.  The Xbox-Activision deal is expected to close as soon as this Friday 13, 2023, pending UK regulatory approval. The UK has already offered provisional approval but has yet to fully finalize it formally. (UPDATE: the UK has now approved the Xbox Activision deal, effectively clearing the last hurdle.)  To that end, Activision CEO Bobby Kotick called an all-hands meeting with Activision-Blizzard-King staff today, hosted by none other than James Corden (no relation, I think) of Gavin & Stacey fame. During the meeting, Kotick reminisced about Activision's journey from independent, to being under Vivendi, and then to becoming a publicly traded company. Kotick also discussed future tech, namechecked Guitar Hero, and hinted about what the future of ABK's partnership with Microsoft may look like.   James Corden asked how Kotick and ABK leadership will retain its culture, which Kotick repeatedly described as ""magic"" and ""special"" during the discussion. Kotick emphasized his belief that Microsoft wants to acquire the company for that ""magic,"" represented in the 15,000+ staff within Activision, predicting that Microsoft will seek to maintain it moving forward.  ""I think a lot [Activision's] motivation is that we have these enormous communities of players of 400 million people in 190 countries around the world who are engaged every single day,"" Kotick continued, ""I think people [at Activision] feel this incredible sense of responsibility to deliver for their players. And so I think that's that recognition, and that appreciation, that the focus will be rewarded in the joy of hundreds of millions of people.""  Changing gears a bit, Kotick was asked to look ahead to the future of gaming, and what it could mean for Activision and Microsoft as the firms team up. Kotick discussed machine learning and AI, but also emphasized the need to hire more writers, more actors, to meet the growing expectations of gamers. He also surprisingly namechecked Elon Musk's brain interfacing Neuralink as a potential way for interacting with video games, which he described as a ""more visceral"" medium than movies and other entertainment media.  ""If you look at the new technologies that are on the horizon, we're going to be able to do things that we've never done before with AI and machine learning. The quality of graphics are now elevated to a place where we're going to need more writing talent and more acting talent — because we won't be able to actually fulfill the expectations of our players."" Kotick continued, ""Games are always very different than film and television. In film and television, you are successful by creating a connection that's emotional between you and the audience — our experiences are more visceral, but it's changing. We have characters on the screen and video games who with mouth movements and facial animation that is realistic — you're going to have a new dimension of emotional connection that we've not yet mastered.""  Kotick also discussed technological innovations, mentioning how mobile devices took gaming from a fairly expensive middle-class pursuit in developed nations in the early days, to a global phenomenon. Xbox lead Phil Spencer often talks about Microsoft's goal to reach all of the world's ""2 billion"" gamers, and mobile devices will naturally form part of that strategy. However, Kotick was also interested in discussing future tech, such as Elon Musk's Neuralink, as well as VR.  ""I talked a little earlier about the physical experience of interacting with something on screen. I think you'll see things like Neuralink — you'll actually be able to interact with things on the screen, where there isn't a controller."" Kotick continued that it might be a Neuralink, but also an earpiece, headset, or ""some other type of sensor."" Kotick began discussing how Microsoft Research could aid with this pursuit, while heavily hinting at Guitar Hero.  ""A big part of what I've seen in Microsoft is research. And they do development in areas that are extraordinary. And so being able to tap into their AI and machine learning capability, the data analytics, new ways of thinking about graphics — I just see unlimited potential for what we do,"" Kotick explained. ""We're uniquely situated as a company because we have the very best franchises in all of video games.""  Kotick looked ahead to the ""next 10 years of gaming,"" reminiscing about transformative titles from Activision's back catalog like Pitfall, River Raids, and Kaboom! of decades past. Kotick also namechecked Guitar Hero, hinting that it's currently on the path to a revival: ""The re-emergence of Guitar Hero and other things would not be possible without the different types of resources. And so, you know, just the endless possibilities for the future that are just incredibly exciting."" Kotick signed off by presumably referencing machine learning graphics technologies like DLSS that enable lower-power devices to access more immersive visuals, typically associated with higher-end gaming PCs and more expensive gaming laptops. ""The accessibility that's going to come from less and less expensive processing that will be more widely available, and inexpensively available, is going to just create more and more opportunities for the amazingly talented people that we have here.""   Microsoft and Activision are a natural fit essentially, with similar goals when it comes to online-based, community-oriented service games, but ABK also shores up some of Xbox's biggest shortcomings. Microsoft's top competitors enjoy decades of nostalgic globally recognized franchises dating all the way back to the 80s. Microsoft was relatively late to the console game, and has suffered because of it to some degree, among other well-documented (and often self-inflicted) reasons. Activision has also had many of its own difficulties in recent years, as it seeks to maintain its leadership position with games like Call of Duty, despite intense competition in the space. Shifting user behavior, and the rise of new markets and mobile gaming giants have given Activision a range of challenges — and many of these are challenges Microsoft will now inherit. Still, there are far more reasons to be excited for the future, in my view.  Thanks to Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft is creating one of the most high-value subscription services on the planet, as the battle for attention rages between streaming services, social media, and traditional gaming. Microsoft also seeks to crack open Apple and Google's duopoly on mobile platforms, which could see a wave of innovation flood the space, in much the same way Steam fostered on PC. New technologies that Microsoft finds itself embedded in, like AI, will also have some as-of-yet undefined role to play here too. For Activision and Xbox gamers, though, the status quo isn't enough. Fans want to see franchises like StarCraft and Guitar Hero revived, and games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft improved — while also demanding a more steady cadence of high-quality content from Xbox itself. Expectations are high, and competition for time and money has never been fiercer. The opportunities are real, but the challenges on the horizon, are also very real too.

             Gen Z employees, aged 16-26, have reported a higher incidence of mental health issues linked to stress, anxiety, and depression over the past year compared to other age groups. A staggering 77% express a likelihood of leaving their current employer, with only 23% indicating a commitment to staying. Despite being the most financially stressed generation, their workplace satisfaction is influenced more by cultural factors than monetary considerations. Read on: https://lnkd.in/ei7cYBYh

             According to recent data, women-led businesses in the UK secured only 3.5% of equity funding during the first half of 2023. This figure represents a slight improvement compared to the full-year total for 2022. However, a significant disparity persists between male-led teams, which received 85.1% of the equity deal value in the first half of the year. Startups led by a combination of men and women managed to secure 11.4% of funding during the same period. These findings, part of a report by The Entrepreneurs Network in collaboration with Barclays, highlight the substantial challenges that female entrepreneurs continue to face in the UK in terms of accessing funding and support.

           "
https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk,"Elon Musk - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre",20231001,Elon Musk creció en una casa grande con sus hermanos y varios primos. Su madre trabajó en casa como asesora nutricionista. En los fines de semana también ...,"Elon Reeve Musk (Pretoria, 28 de junio de 1971), conocido como Elon Musk, es un empresario, inversor y magnate sudafricano que también posee las nacionalidades canadiense y estadounidense. Es el fundador, consejero delegado e ingeniero jefe de SpaceX; inversor ángel, director general y arquitecto de productos de Tesla, Inc.; fundador de The Boring Company; cofundador de Neuralink y OpenAI, aunque ya no tiene más participación en esta última por desacuerdos en el rumbo de la empresa, además de ser el director de tecnología de X Corp..[5]​ Con un patrimonio neto estimado en unos 207 mil millones de dólares en junio de 2023,[6]​ Musk es la persona más rica del mundo según el índice de multimillonarios de Bloomberg y la lista de multimillonarios en tiempo real de Forbes.[7]​[8]​ 
Musk nació de madre canadiense y padre sudafricano blanco, y se crio en Pretoria (Sudáfrica). Estudió brevemente en la Universidad de Pretoria antes de trasladarse a Canadá a los 17 años. Se matriculó en la Universidad de Queen y se trasladó a la Universidad de Pensilvania dos años después, donde se graduó en Economía y Física. En 1995 se trasladó a California para asistir a la Universidad Stanford, pero en su lugar decidió seguir una carrera empresarial, cofundando la empresa de software web Zip2 con su hermano Kimbal. La empresa fue adquirida por Compaq por 307 millones de dólares en 1999. Ese mismo año, Musk cofundó el banco online X.com, que se fusionó con Confinity en 2000 para formar PayPal. La empresa fue comprada por eBay en 2002 por 1500 millones de dólares.  
En 2002, Musk fundó SpaceX, fabricante aeroespacial y empresa de servicios de transporte espacial, de la que es CEO e ingeniero jefe. En 2003, se unió al fabricante de vehículos eléctricos Tesla Motors, Inc. (ahora Tesla, Inc.) como presidente y arquitecto de productos, convirtiéndose en su consejero delegado en 2008. En 2006, ayudó a crear SolarCity, una empresa de servicios de energía solar que posteriormente fue adquirida por Tesla y se convirtió en Tesla Energy. En 2015, cofundó OpenAI, una empresa de investigación sin ánimo de lucro que promueve la inteligencia artificial amigable. En 2016, cofundó Neuralink, una empresa de neurotecnología centrada en el desarrollo de interfaces cerebro-ordenador, y fundó The Boring Company, una empresa de construcción de túneles. También acordó la compra de la importante red social estadounidense Twitter en 2022 por 44 000 millones de dólares. Musk también ha propuesto el hyperloop. En noviembre de 2021, el director general de Tesla fue la primera persona de la historia en acumular una fortuna de 300 000 millones de dólares.[9]​ 
Ha sido criticado por hacer declaraciones poco científicas y controvertidas. En 2018, fue demandado por la Comisión de Bolsa y Valores de Estados Unidos (SEC) por tuitear falsamente que había conseguido financiación para una adquisición privada de Tesla. Llegó a un acuerdo con la SEC pero no admitió su culpabilidad, renunciando temporalmente a su presidencia y aceptando limitaciones en su uso de Twitter. En 2019, ganó un juicio por difamación presentado contra él por un espeleólogo británico que asesoró en el rescate de la cueva de Tham Luang. Musk también ha sido criticado por difundir información errónea sobre la pandemia de COVID-19 y por sus otras opiniones sobre asuntos como la inteligencia artificial, las criptomonedas y el transporte público. 
Sus padres, Errol Musk y Maye Haldeman,[10]​ se conocieron en la escuela secundaria. Él era un ingeniero y promotor inmobiliario sudafricano que en su día fue copropietario de una mina de esmeraldas en la República de Zambia, cerca del lago Tanganica[11]​[12]​[13]​[14]​ y concejal de Pretoria que se opuso a las políticas del apartheid y al Partido Nacional en Sudáfrica.[15]​[16]​ Su madre es nutricionista y modelo; oriunda de Canadá, se mudó a Pretoria en 1950.[17]​[18]​ Se casaron en 1970 y en tres años tuvieron tres hijos: Elon (28 de junio de 1971), Kimbal (20 de septiembre de 1972) y Tosca Musk (20 de julio de 1974).[18]​ La familia era muy rica en la juventud de Elon; su padre dijo una vez: ""Teníamos tanto dinero que a veces ni siquiera podíamos cerrar nuestra caja fuerte"".[12]​ 
Elon Musk creció en una casa grande con sus hermanos y varios primos. Su madre trabajó en casa como asesora nutricionista. En los fines de semana también trabajaba como modelo, por lo que sus hijos apenas veían a sus padres y tenían mucha libertad para perseguir sus intereses.  A los nueve años comenzó a programar un Commodore VIC-20 que tenía 8 kilobytes de memoria RAM.[19]​ A los diez años aprendió a programar.[20]​ A los doce años diseñó su primer programa, un videojuego del espacio llamado Blastar, y se lo vendió por el equivalente a 500 USD a la revista sudafricana PC and Office Technology. En 1984 publicaron las 167 líneas de código fuente y reseñaron «En este juego tienes que destruir un carguero extraterrestre que lleva bombas mortales de hidrógeno y Status Beam Machines. El programa hace un buen uso de los sprites y las animaciones, y en este sentido su lectura merece la pena».[20]​[21]​[22]​ 
El dinero que ganaba programando lo gastaba en cómics, ordenadores y juegos de rol como Dungeons & Dragons.[23]​ 
En 1979, para escapar de los maltratos de su marido, que solía golpearla, su madre Maye se divorció y se mudó a Durban. Errol reclamó en los tribunales los términos del divorcio.[24]​ En 1981 Elon decidió ir a vivir a Johannesburgo con su padre. Kimbal se unió a ellos cuatro años después.[18]​ 
En la escuela no tenía amigos y era maltratado por sus compañeros. Tras tomar clases de karate, judo, lucha y a los dieciséis años crecer hasta los 180 cm empezó a defenderse.[25]​ Consciente de que sería más fácil emigrar a Estados Unidos desde Canadá,[26]​ solicitó un pasaporte canadiense a través de su madre,[27]​[28]​ nacida en Regina, Saskatchewan, de padres estadounidenses. Mientras esperaba la documentación, asistió a la Universidad de Pretoria durante cinco meses; esto le permitió evitar el servicio militar obligatorio en Sudáfrica.[28]​ 
Como muchos de sus parientes vivían en el Oeste canadiense, en 1989 Elon, Kimbal y Tosca Musk, junto a Maye Haldeman, se mudaron a Kingston, Ontario.[10]​[29]​ Cuando llegó, todos los ahorros de Maye estaban bloqueados, por lo que tuvo que trabajar en varios empleos.[cita requerida] Alquiló un pequeño apartamento en Toronto donde estuvieron tres semanas retirando grapas del suelo y papel pintado de las paredes. En el proceso, Maye se cortó una mano y puso en riesgo sus trabajos como modelo. Con el primer dinero que ganó, Maye compró una alfombra gruesa para que pudieran dormir en el suelo del apartamento, y un ordenador para Elon.[30]​ Luego trabajó como investigadora en la Universidad de Toronto y, simultáneamente, impartía clases de nutrición y modelaje dos noches por semana y además trabajaba como asesora nutricionista y estudiaba para su segundo máster dietético. Sus tres hijos tuvieron que conseguir becas, pedir préstamos y trabajar para estudiar en la universidad. Muchas veces no podían comer carne roja ni una vez a la semana.[30]​ 
En 1992 Elon obtuvo una beca para estudiar Economía y Física en la Universidad de Pensilvania. Recibió sus títulos de economía y física del Wharton School en la Universidad de Pensilvania. Después se matriculó en Stanford para hacer el doctorado, pero a los dos días lo abandonó para iniciar su propia empresa.[22]​ En 1995 tuvo la intención de trabajar para Netscape y fue a sus oficinas, pero no se atrevió a hablar con nadie por timidez.[19]​ 
Uno de sus profesores en la Universidad de Pensilvania era director ejecutivo de una empresa en Los Gatos, Silicon Valley, dedicada a investigar ultracondensadores electrolíticos destinados a vehículos eléctricos. Elon trabajó un verano en la empresa Pinnacle Research. Esos ultracondensadores tenían una densidad energética muy alta, pero sus componentes químicos eran carísimos y se vendían por miligramos porque había muy pocas minas que los extrajeran y no eran escalables para su producción en masa.[23]​[31]​ 
Tras obtener sus licenciaturas, e inspirado por innovadores como Nikola Tesla,[32]​ decidió entrar en tres áreas en las que consideraba había «problemas importantes», como luego indicaría él mismo: «Una de ellas era internet, otra la energía renovable y la otra era el espacio».[20]​ 
Kimbal acompañó a Elon en un viaje en coche atravesando todo Estados Unidos en un mes, desde Silicon Valley a Filadelfia, donde Elon tenía que completar sus estudios en Penn. Durante el viaje hablaron mucho de emprender un negocio.[33]​ En 1995, Musk se inscribió en el programa de doctorado en Física Aplicada y Ciencia de Materiales en la Universidad de Stanford, pero a los dos días abandonó las clases para poder fundar Zip2, junto con su hermano Kimbal Musk y su amigo Greg Curry.[34]​ Elon Musk era el director ejecutivo de Zip2.[19]​ Zip2 gestionaba el desarrollo, alojamiento y mantenimiento de sitios web específicos para empresas de medios de comunicación. Esto les permitía establecer una presencia en la web a través de la edición automática añadiendo mapas e indicaciones de ruta para ir de puerta a puerta a las direcciones (un negocio que anticipaba lo que sería Google Maps combinado con Yelp).[22]​ Para ello consiguieron el uso gratuito de la cartografía de Navteq, que había costado 300 millones de dólares. Aplicaron el lenguaje Java para enviar los mapas e indicaciones como imágenes vectoriales en lugar de mapas de bits, que eran muy lentos de transmitir en la incipiente red de internet.[35]​ Elon se dedicó a la programación y la ingeniería, mientras que Kimbal hacía las ventas y buscaba capital.[36]​ 
Elon era inmigrante con una visa temporal y Kimbal era un inmigrante ilegal en Estados Unidos.[37]​ Por la falta de recursos económicos Kimbal y Elon estuvieron un tiempo viviendo en la oficina de 4 m x 9 m de Zip2 y usaban las instalaciones de YMCA para ducharse.[38]​ Solían comer muy barato en Jack in the Box.[35]​ Cuando lo pudieron pagar se mudaron a un apartamento y Kimbal cocinaba para toda la plantilla de Zip2.[39]​ Su hermana Tosca se mudó de Toronto a San Francisco y trabajó con ellos en Zip2.[40]​ 
En febrero de 1999 gestionaba casi 200 sitios web, incluyendo el sitio New York Today, que era un directorio local del The New York Times. Zip2 también gestionaba parte de las cadenas de Hearst Corporation, Times Mirror, Knight-Ridder y Pulitzer Publishing. Zip2 fue vendida a Compaq Computer en 1999 por 307 millones de dólares,[41]​[39]​ de los que Elon recibió 22 millones de dólares.[25]​ 
En marzo de 1999 Elon Musk, Ho, Harris Fricker y Cristopher Payne fundaron X.com como una startup financiera. Inicialmente Musk invirtió 12 millones de dólares.[42]​ A los cinco meses de su fundación Harris Fricker amenazó diciendo que si no era director ejecutivo se marcharía con el resto a crear otra compañía. Elon Musk le dijo que debería hacerlo. Fricker, Ho y otros ingenieros claves abandonaron X.com. Fricker tuvo una carrera exitosa como director ejecutivo de GMP Capital. Payne fundó una firma de capital privado en Toronto.[42]​ 
X.com fue uno de los primeros bancos de internet. Tuvo que luchar contra numerosas regulaciones bancarias. Sus depósitos estaban asegurados por la FDIC.[42]​ 
Confinity Inc. fue una compañía de software de Silicon Valley fundada en diciembre de 1998 por Max Levchin, Peter Thiel y Luke Nosek como empresa criptográfica que procesaba pagos electrónicos.
A finales de 1999 Confinity lanzó su producto estrella, PayPal, que a través del puerto de infrarrojos permitía mandar dinero entre usuarios de PDA como la Palm Pilot.[43]​ 
En marzo de 2000 X.com y Confinity decidieron que tenía más sentido unir fuerzas que derrochar dinero en publicidad para atraer a los mismos clientes. Combinando el producto PayPal con los sofisticados servicios de X.com se fusionaron en una nueva entidad llamada X.com de la que Elon Musk fue nombrado director ejecutivo por ser el mayor accionista de la compañía fusionada resultante. En unas semanas X.com levantó 100 millones de dólares de inversión de Deutsche Bank y Goldman Sachs. En aquel tiempo X.com tenía más de un millón de clientes.[21]​ 
Las dos compañías trataron de juntar sus culturas con poco éxito. Hubo peleas sobre el diseño de la infraestructura tecnológica de la empresa. El equipo de Confinity, liderado por Levchin, quería usar software de código abierto Linux, mientras que Musk quería usar el software de centro de datos de Microsoft.[42]​ 
X.com se enfrentó en duras batallas a la infraestructura tecnológica, el fraude en línea y las estrategias de marca. En septiembre de 2000 las tensiones dentro del equipo directivo aumentaron. 
En enero de 2000 Elon Musk se había casado con Justine Wilson. El trabajo no les había permitido ir de luna de miel. Nueve meses después planearon juntar negocio y ocio para hacer un viaje para buscar capital inversor y terminarlo en luna de miel en los Juegos Olímpicos de Sídney. A las 22:30 h, cuando Musk estaba volando, se celebró una junta extraordinaria de X.com en la que se destituyó a Elon Musk como director ejecutivo y se nombró a Peter Thiel. Elon Musk canceló su luna de miel, tomó el primer avión de vuelta a California y pidió al consejo que reconsiderase su decisión.
Musk terminó aceptando la reorganización y aunque su influencia en la compañía decreció, Musk quedó como asesor consultivo y siguió invirtiendo aumentando su posición como mayor accionista.[21]​
En junio de 2001 X.com cambió el nombre por el de su producto PayPal para denominarse PayPal Inc. 
En 2002 PayPal empezó a cotizar en bolsa. Por entonces la compañía facturaba 240 millones de dólares al año con PayPal. Cuando eBay mostró interés en comprar PayPal la mayoría querían vender cuanto antes. Musk y Mortiz pidieron al consejo que rechazara las primeras ofertas. En julio de 2002 eBay subió la oferta hasta 1500 millones y el consejo y Musk aceptaron la venta.[42]​ 
En octubre de 2002, eBay adquirió PayPal por 1500 millones de dólares en acciones.[44]​ Antes de la venta, Musk era el accionista mayoritario, con el 11.7 % de las acciones de PayPal.[45]​ 
Con la venta Elon Musk ganó 180 millones de dólares después de impuestos.[22]​ Dedicó 100 M$ a fundar SpaceX, 70 M$ a Tesla, Inc. y 10 M$ a SolarCity.[25]​ Varios miembros del equipo de PayPal fundaron sus propias compañías, como YouTube (Chad Hurley, Steve Chen y Jawed Karim), LinkedIn (Reid Hoffman), Yelp (Russel Simmons, Jeremy Stoppelman), Palantir Technologies, y Jammer.[23]​ 
Otros, como Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman y Botha, se convirtieron en grandes inversores en la industria tecnológica.[42]​ En 2015 eBay se separó de PayPal para hacerla una compañía independiente.[46]​ 
En 2002, Elon Musk comenzó a investigar la viabilidad de mandar un vehículo a Marte. Cada cohete Delta-2 costaba entre 50 y 60 millones de dólares por misión y se necesitaban al menos dos misiones. Realizó tres viajes a Rusia e intentó comprar sin éxito cohetes intercontinentales ICBM sin las cabezas nucleares.[31]​[47]​ En el avión de vuelta con sus socios Mike Griffin y Jim Cantrell, Elon les mostró una hoja de cálculo en la que había trabajado durante meses. Era el primer prototipo de SpaceX donde detallaba todas las partes del negocio. En el diseño usaría cohetes reutilizables. Tendría una estrategia de integración vertical. En las necesidades de los clientes había un nicho emergente para lanzar satélites pequeños. Analizaba criterios de costes y beneficios. El modelo de negocio sería el de una empresa aeroespacial privada. También había estudiado la física detrás de la estructura del cohete y el lanzamiento.[21]​ 
En junio de 2002, Musk fundó su tercera compañía, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX),[48]​
de la cual es actualmente el director ejecutivo y director de tecnología. SpaceX se dedica a desarrollar y producir lanzaderas espaciales, con un énfasis en reducción de costes y una alta fiabilidad. Los primeros dos cohetes de transporte desarrollados por SpaceX son el Falcon 1 y el Falcon 9, y su primera cápsula es la Dragon. 
El 23 de diciembre de 2008 SpaceX firmó un contrato de 1600 millones de dólares con la NASA[49]​ por 12 vuelos de su cohete Falcon 9 y la nave Dragon a la Estación Espacial Internacional, reemplazando al Transbordador Espacial después de su retiro en el 2011. Inicialmente, el Falcon 9 y Dragon reemplazarán la función de transporte de carga del transbordador, mientras que la función de transporte del personal será realizada por el Soyuz. Sin embargo, SpaceX ha diseñado el Falcon 9/Dragon para transporte de astronautas, y la Comisión Augustine ha recomendado que el transporte de astronautas sea manejado por empresas comerciales como SpaceX.[50]​ 
Musk ve la exploración espacial como un paso importante en la expansión —incluso la preservación— de la conciencia humana.[51]​ Musk ha dicho que la vida en múltiples planetas nos puede servir como una defensa en contra de amenazas a la supervivencia de la especie humana.  El objetivo de Musk es el de reducir el costo de los viajes tripulados al espacio por un factor de 100. Fundó SpaceX con 100 millones de dólares de su fortuna acumulada anteriormente y continúa siendo el director ejecutivo (CEO) y de tecnología (CTO) de su empresa ubicada en Hawthorne, California. 
En siete años, SpaceX diseñó la familia de cohetes Falcon y las naves espaciales multiuso Dragon desde cero. En septiembre de 2009, El Falcon 1 se convirtió en el primer vehículo de combustible líquido de financiamiento privado en poner un satélite en la órbita terrestre. La NASA seleccionó a SpaceX para formar parte del primer programa que entregaría a empresas privadas la responsabilidad de llevar carga a la Estación Espacial Internacional. Este contrato, que tiene un valor mínimo de 1600 millones de dólares y un valor máximo de 3100 millones, se ha convertido en un elemento fundamental de la estación espacial. Además de estos servicios, los objetivos de SpaceX incluyen reducir los costos de los vuelos orbitales y aumentar su fiabilidad, ambos por factor de diez, al mismo tiempo que crea el primer vehículo de lanzamiento orbital reutilizable. En los próximos años, Musk se enfocará en llevar a los astronautas a la Estación Espacial Internacional, e incluso a Marte.[52]​ 
Starlink es un proyecto de la empresa SpaceX para la creación de una constelación de satélites de internet[53]​ con el objetivo de brindar un servicio de internet de banda ancha, baja latencia y cobertura mundial a bajo costo.[54]​[55]​[56]​ En 2017 se completaron los requisitos regulatorios para lanzar 11 943 satélites para mediados de la década de 2020.[57]​ SpaceX también planea vender satélites para uso militar,[58]​ científico y de exploración.[56]​ En noviembre de 2018, la empresa recibió la autorización del ente gubernamental estadounidense (FCC) para desplegar 7518 satélites de banda ancha, que se sumarían a los 4425 aprobados en marzo del mismo año.[59]​ El desarrollo comenzó en 2015, y los primeros prototipos de satélite fueron lanzados el 22 de febrero de 2018.[60]​[61]​ El lanzamiento de los primeros 60 satélites se llevó a cabo el 23 de mayo de 2019, y se espera que el inicio de operaciones comerciales de la constelación empiece en el año 2020.[62]​[63]​ La investigación y desarrollo del proyecto tiene lugar en las instalaciones de SpaceX ubicadas en Redmond, Washington.
El tráfico de Internet a través de un satélite geoestacionario tiene una latencia teórica mínima de al menos 477 ms desde el usuario al satélite pero, en la práctica, esta latencia es de 600 ms o más. Los satélites de StarLink orbitarían entre 1/30 y 1/105 de la distancia de las órbitas geoestacionarias y, por lo tanto, ofrecerían latencias de entre 7 y 30 ms, comparables o inferiores a las redes de cable o fibra existentes.[64]​ En mayo de 2018, SpaceX calculó que el costo total del desarrollo y la construcción de la constelación se acercará a los 10 000 millones de USD.[65]​ 
En 2003 JB Straubel y Elon Musk visitaron la empresa AC Propulsion, que tenía un prototipo de coche deportivo eléctrico basado en un kit de un coche de gasolina al que habían adaptado un motor eléctrico y unas baterías de iones de litio. El prototipo aceleraba de 0 a 100 km/h en menos de 4 segundos y tenía una autonomía de 300 kilómetros. Durante meses Elon Musk trató de convencerlos de que comercializaran el vehículo, pero ellos no estaban interesados en hacerlo. Los miembros de AC Propulsion lo pusieron en contacto con Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning y fundaron Tesla Motors con la intención de fabricar un coche eléctrico deportivo. 
En abril de 2004 Elon Musk decidió invertir 6,3 millones de dólares en Tesla Motors. No era el único inversor, pero contribuyó con el 98 % de la financiación. Otros inversores fueron Eberhard y pequeñas firmas de capital riesgo. Musk continuó invirtiendo en todas las rondas siguientes. Como resultado de la crisis financiera de 2008 y retiros forzosos en Tesla,[66]​ Musk aceptó tomar el puesto de director ejecutivo en 2008.[67]​ 
Elon diseñó los logotipos y letras de Tesla y SpaceX.[68]​ 
En 2006 anunció su plan maestro para Tesla: 
[69]​ 
Infravaloraron el capital necesario para crear una empresa fabricante de coches. Tenían previsto gastar 25 millones de USD antes de la primera entrega y terminaron gastando 140 millones de USD.
Compraban carrocerías de Lotus Elise a las que instalaban baterías, motor eléctrico y controladores aumentando el peso más del 60 % por lo que invalidaban las pruebas de choque originales. Al final el Tesla Roadster tenía solo un 7 % de piezas comunes con el Lotus Elise. 
El ensamblado de los componentes se hacía en unas instalaciones que les alquiló un concesionario de Ford.[70]​ 
Elon afirmó repetidamente que Martin Eberhard es la peor persona con la que ha trabajado.[71]​ Las dificultades financieras estuvieron a punto de llevar a Tesla a la bancarrota. Hasta junio de 2012 se habían vendido 2100 Tesla Roadster en 31 países. El deportivo de dos plazas Tesla Roadster costaba unos 100 000 dólares. 
El nombre Tesla era una marca registrada por un particular en 1995 y Marc Tappening consiguió negociar su compra por 75 000 USD. 
En febrero de 2016, tras diez años en el empeño, compraron el dominio tesla.com por 10 millones de USD a Stu Grossman, que no lo usaba para alojar páginas web.[72]​[73]​ 
De los primeros tiempos de Tesla Elon recordaba:  Aprendiendo de los errores cometidos con el Roadster diseñaron desde cero un turismo eléctrico de lujo con 5 puertas y prestaciones de un coche deportivo. Tenía actualizaciones de software telemáticas y podía hacer viajes cargando en la red de cargadores rápidos, superchargers, de Tesla. 
En octubre de 2010 Tesla compró la vieja fábrica NUMMI, que había fabricado para GM y Toyota, de la que apenas pudieron usar máquinas o herramientas y la mayoría fue a la chatarra. 
Los suministradores de componentes del automóvil eran reacios a venderles piezas de calidad y Tesla se vio obligada a fabricarlas mediante integración vertical para no desaparecer.[74]​ 
El 22 de junio de 2012 comenzó la producción del liftback eléctrico Tesla Model S de 5 plazas más dos asientos infantiles. En 2020 estaba a la venta el Tesla Model S P100D Ludicrous con una aceleración de 0 a 100 km/h en 2,3 segundos, lo que le convertía en el coche de serie más rápido del mundo en aceleración. 
El Tesla Model X es un SUV eléctrico fabricado por Tesla Motors basado en la plataforma del Model S. Las puertas traseras de gaviota son articuladas y se abren hacia arriba. 
Inició sus entregas en el mercado estadounidense en septiembre de 2015.
En julio de 2016 Musk publicó la segunda parte del plan maestro de Tesla:[75]​  En julio de 2016, Tesla comenzó a desarrollar su hardware y software Autopilot dentro de la empresa, finalizando su colaboración con Mobileye.[76]​
En noviembre de 2016, SolarCity fue adquirida por Tesla, Inc.[77]​ 
El Tesla Model 3 es un vehículo eléctrico que se anunció con un precio base de 35 000 dólares. Su producción comenzó a mediados de 2017. En 2018, 2019 y 2020 fue el modelo eléctrico más vendido en el mundo. En 2019 el Tesla Model 3 fue el séptimo turismo más vendido en Estados Unidos con 154 836 unidades. 
En enero de 2019 Musk viajó a China para el comienzo de las obras de Gigafactoría Shanghai, que era la primera gran planta de Tesla fuera de Estados Unidos.[78]​ El tiempo entre el inicio de obras y la producción de los primeros coches fue de menos de un año.[79]​ 
El Tesla model Y es un crossover eléctrico que comparte el 75 % de las piezas con el Tesla Model 3. Sus entregas comenzaron en marzo de 2020. 
En 2020 Tesla había vendido un millón de vehículos acumulando sus modelos Roadster, Model S, Model X y Model 3 y se había anunciado la producción inminente del Tesla Semi, el Tesla Roadster 2020 y el Tesla Cybertruck. 
Todos los vehículos Tesla fabricados desde 2014 llevan de serie componentes electrónicos para el funcionamiento del Autopilot (asistencia a la conducción) y, desde abril de 2019, todos los vehículos Tesla tienen activadas las funciones básicas del sistema. Las funciones avanzadas de conducción autónoma (Full Self-Driving Capabilities) son opcionales.[80]​ Las capacidades del Autopilot se actualizan telemáticamente sin llevar los coches al taller. El sistema Autopilot entrena una red neuronal de aprendizaje profundo con datos que recopila de toda la flota de vehículos Tesla equipados con el hardware Autopilot, que en marzo de 2020 ya eran 950 000. Esto convertía a Tesla en la empresa que había recopilado más datos reales para la conducción autónoma en todo tipo de situaciones. 
A principios de 2020 Tesla se convirtió en el segundo fabricante de coches en capitalización bursátil tras Toyota.[81]​ 
En enero de 2016 Musk tenía 28,9 millones de acciones de Tesla, que equivalía a un 22 % de la compañía.[82]​[83]​ 
En diciembre de 2022, se reportó que Musk vendió 22 millones de acciones de Tesla por valor de más de 3500 millones de dólares.[84]​ 
SolarCity es una empresa de productos fotovoltaicos y servicios fundada en 2006, donde su primo, Lyndon Rive, es el consejero delegado y cofundador. Elon Musk es el principal inversor y presidente de la junta directiva de SolarCity.[85]​[86]​ La idea sobre el proyecto surgió cuando Musk participó del festival Burning Man de 2004.[87]​ 
Elon Musk no dirige las operaciones diarias de la empresa. En 2011 SolarCity era la mayor empresa proveedora de sistemas de energía solar en Estados Unidos. Su objetivo es extender la energía solar y hacerla lo más asequible posible.[88]​ La motivación subyacente para la fundación de SolarCity y Tesla Motors es la de combatir el calentamiento global.[89]​ En 2016 SolarCity se fusionó con Tesla, Inc. 
Él es miembro de la junta directiva, junto con sus compañeros fundadores de PayPal Luke Nosek y Peter Thiel.[90]​ Halcyon Molecular fue fundada con el objetivo de investigar medicamentos, extender la longevidad. 
El 30 de abril de 2015 Tesla presentó dos sistemas de almacenamiento de energía: Powerwall y Powerpack. El Tesla Powerwall es un paquete de baterías de iones de litio usado como respaldo en la red eléctrica de un domicilio y que puede almacenar energía eléctrica proveniente de la generación de energía renovable, como instalaciones solares o eólicas, o almacenar electricidad en horario nocturno cuando la electricidad es más barata. Puede instalarse en exteriores o interiores y no precisa un cuarto cerrado.[91]​
También permite realizar una instalación eléctrica en lugares remotos sin acceso a la red. 
Neuralink es una empresa de nanobiotecnología fundada por Musk que tiene como objetivo integrar el cerebro humano con la inteligencia artificial. La compañía fue fundada en 2016 y se dio a conocer al gran público por primera vez en marzo de 2017. La empresa se centra en la creación de dispositivos que se pueden implantar en el cerebro humano, con el propósito final de ayudar a los seres humanos a fusionarse con el software y mantener el ritmo de los avances en inteligencia artificial. Estas mejoras podrían mejorar la memoria o permitir una interacción más directa con los dispositivos informáticos.[92]​[93]​[94]​ 
OpenAI es una empresa de investigación de inteligencia artificial (IA) sin fines de lucro que tiene como objetivo promover y desarrollar inteligencia artificial amigable, de tal manera que beneficie a la humanidad en su conjunto. 
The Boring Company (La Compañía Tuneladora) es una compañía de excavación e infraestructuras fundada por Elon Musk a finales de 2016, después de mencionar primero la idea en su cuenta de Twitter.[95]​[96]​ Musk afirmó que la dificultad con el tráfico de Los Ángeles y las limitaciones de una red de transporte en 2D fueron la inspiración para el proyecto.[97]​ En febrero de 2017, la compañía comenzó cavando una zanja de prueba de 9 metros de ancho, 15 metros de largo y 4.5 metros de profundidad en las oficinas de SpaceX en Los Ángeles, debido a que la construcción en ese lugar no requiere de permisos.[95]​[98]​ A principios de 2018 the Boring Company se desgajó de SpaceX formando una compañía separada. El 90 % de las acciones fueron a Elon Musk y el 10 % a los primeros empleados. En diciembre de 2018 se reasignó el 6 % de las acciones a SpaceX.[99]​ 
El objetivo de la compañía es mejorar el método y la velocidad de excavación lo suficiente para establecer una red subterránea de túneles que sea económicamente factible.[100]​  A finales de abril de 2017, la compañía empezó a utilizar una tuneladora para iniciar la construcción de un túnel utilizable en SpaceX, tal como había anunciado Musk en marzo del mismo año.[102]​ En mayo de 2019 la compañía ganó un proyecto de 48.7 millones de USD para transportar personas bajo Las Vegas. En septiembre comenzaron los preparativos[103]​ y la construcción en octubre de 2019.[104]​ El 15 de noviembre de 2019 comenzaron a tunelar el primer túnel[105]​ y lo terminaron el 27 de diciembre de 2019. Musk anunció que estaría operativo en 2020.[106]​ 
Usa su versión del método científico: 
Para alimentar un coche eléctrico había dos opciones viables: baterías o una pila de combustible alimentada por hidrógeno. 
Mientras otros fabricantes —como Toyota, Honda, Kia— apostaban por el hidrógeno Musk lo hizo por las baterías para los vehículos Tesla.
En el Automotive World News Congress de Detroit en 2015 y respondiendo a una pregunta Musk dijo en dos minutos: 
[107]​ 
Los coches de pila de combustible de hidrógeno se comenzaron a vender comercialmente en 2013. En 2017 vendieron 6475 unidades en todo el mundo.[108]​ En 2019 las ventas globales alcanzaron las 7574 unidades de los tres modelos disponibles: Hyundai Nexo, Toyota Mirai y Honda Clarity.[109]​
Sin embargo, en 2019 globalmente se vendieron 2.2 millones de vehículos a batería, de los que Tesla vendió 367 820 unidades.[110]​ 
Un lídar o lidar (acrónimo del inglés LIDAR, Light Detection and Ranging o Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging) es un dispositivo que permite determinar la distancia desde un emisor láser a un objeto o superficie utilizando un haz láser pulsado. La distancia al objeto se determina midiendo el tiempo de retraso entre la emisión del pulso y su detección a través de la señal reflejada. En 2019 un LIDAR para coche se vendía por unos 75 000 USD.[111]​ 
En 2019 en el desarrollo de las técnicas para la conducción autónoma la mayoría de las empresas (Waymo de Alphabet, Ford, Uber, y GM Cruise) usaban LIDAR mientras que Tesla apostó por resolver el problema sin LIDAR y usando un ordenador que procesaba las imágenes de cámaras para reconocer y comprender el mundo.  [112]​ 
En 2019 Tesla desarrolló y produjo su propio ordenador FSD para la conducción autónoma que procesaba 2300 fps (fotogramas por segundo) consumiendo solo 72 vatios.
Elon Musk dijo los mapas GPS de alta precisión para la conducción autónoma eran una muy mala idea porque llevaban a que el sistema se hiciera extremadamente frágil al depender demasiado de ellos y no ser capaz de adaptarse.[111]​ 
En abril de 2019 Tesla tenía 425 000 vehículos equipados con el hardware para la conducción autónoma. En marzo de 2020 ya eran 950 000 coches que cuando circulaban proporcionaban a Tesla datos de conducción real (no simulada) que alimentaban su red neuronal de aprendizaje profundo para la conducción autónoma. 
Musk es el presidente de la Musk Foundation, que enfoca sus esfuerzos filantrópicos en la educación científica, salud pediátrica y energía limpia.[88]​ 
Es uno de los fiduciarios de la Fundación X Prize, la cual promueve el uso de energía limpia.
Es miembro de la junta directiva de la Space Foundation, La National Academy of Aeronautics and Space Engineering, la Sociedad Planetaria, y la Space Engineering Advisory Board de la Universidad de Stanford. 
Musk también es miembro de la junta de fiduciarios del California Institute of Technology (Caltech). 
En el 2010, Musk inició un programa multimillonario a través de su fundación para donar sistemas de energía solar para necesidades críticas en zonas de desastres, dando preferencia a las áreas donde SolarCity no opera y no tiene intención de establecer operaciones. La razón por la que eligió estas áreas, fue para dejar claro que este era un emprendimiento estrictamente filantrópico sin ánimo de lucro. 
El primero de estos equipos en ser utilizado fue en un centro de respuesta a huracanes en Alabama que no había recibido ayuda estatal o federal.[113]​
En julio de 2011 la Musk Foundation donó 250 000 dólares para un proyecto de energía fotovoltaica en Sōma, Fukushima, Japón, que había sido devastada por un reciente tsunami.[114]​ 
En el 2001, Musk tenía planes de llevar adelante el proyecto ""Oasis en Marte"", el cual llevaría un invernadero experimental en miniatura a Marte, que contendría plantas comestibles que crecerían en el regolito marciano.[115]​[55]​ No obstante, decidió posponer indefinidamente el proyecto ya que llegó a la conclusión de que el problema fundamental que impide a la humanidad convertirse en una civilización espacial es la falta de desarrollo en la tecnología de cohetes. Decidió tratar este problema fundando SpaceX para poder crear nuevos cohetes interplanetarios. 
Es uno de los firmantes de The Giving Pledge formado por millonarios que adquieren el compromiso moral de donar parte de su fortuna.[116]​ 
En julio de 2014 el dibujante de cómics Matthew Inman y el bisnieto de Nikola Tesla, William Terbo, pidieron a Elon Musk que donara 8 millones de dólares para la construcción del Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe.[117]​ Musk donó 1 millón de dólares para el proyecto y acordó instalar un Tesla Supercharger en el aparcamiento del museo.[118]​[19]​ 
En enero de 2015 Musk donó 10 millones de dólares para que el Future of Life Institute hiciera un programa de investigación global para mantener beneficiosa para la humanidad a la inteligencia artificial.[119]​[120]​ 
En octubre de 2018, en un esfuerzo para ayudar a resolver la crisis de agua por envenenamiento por plomo en Flint (Míchigan), Musk y la Musk Foundation donaron 480 000 dólares para instalar nuevas fuentes con sistemas de filtración para que todas las escuelas de Flint pudieran tener agua potable segura.[121]​ En octubre de 2019 habían conseguido que 30 000 niños de las 12 zonas escolares tuvieran agua potable segura.[122]​ 
Musk es uno de los mayores donantes de la American Civil Liberties Union ACLU.[123]​ 
En octubre de 2019 Musk donó 1 millón de dólares a la iniciativa para la plantación de 20 millones de árboles '#TeamTrees' liderada por miembros de la comunidad de YouTube y en colaboración con la fundación Arbor Day Foundation.[124]​[125]​ 
Mijail Gorbachov le entregó en 2006, en nombre de Global Green, el premio al diseño de un producto por Tesla Roadster.[126]​ En 2007 Index Design Award lo galardonó por el mismo modelo.[127]​ Ese año la revissta R&D Magazine nombró a Musk Innovador del Año por SpaceX, Tesla and SolarCity.[128]​ 
Inc Magazine le entregó el premio de Emprendedor del Año en 2007 por su trabajo en Tesla y SpaceX.[129]​ También recibió el premio George Low del American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics por su notable contribución al transporte aeroespacial en el 2008. Musk fue reconocido por su diseño del Falcon 1, el primer vehículo privado propulsado con combustible líquido en alcanzar la órbita de la tierra.[130]​ Recibió el Trofeo Von Braun de la Sociedad Espacial Nacional en 2008/2009, por su liderazgo en un logro significativo en el espacio.[131]​ 
Fue incluido en la lista de las 100 personas que más influyeron al mundo en el 2010 de la revista Time. La revista Esquire lo nombró como una de las 75 personas más influyentes del siglo XXI.[51]​ En 2010, fue nombrado el Ejecutivo Automotriz del Año a nivel mundial por demostrar liderazgo tecnológico e innovación con Tesla Motors. Musk es el hombre más joven en recibir este galardón.[132]​ En una encuesta realizada por la Space Foundation en 2010, Musk quedó en el puesto n.º 10 (empatado con el pionero de la cohetería Wernher von Braun) entre los héroes espaciales más populares.[133]​ Fue reconocido como una Leyenda viviente de la aviación ese mismo año por la Fundación Kitty Hawk por crear el sucesor del Transbordador Espacial (F9/Dragon).[134]​ 
En junio del 2011, Musk recibió por el Premio Heinlein por Avances en la Comercialización del Espacio.[135]​ En febrero de ese año, la revista Forbes incluyó a Musk en su lista de los «20 directores ejecutivos de menos de 40 años más poderosos en los Estados Unidos».[136]​ 
La Federación Aeronáutica Internacional, la organización encargada del registro de récords de vuelo, otorgó a Musk el máximo honor de la institución, la FAI Gold Space Medal, por diseñar el primer cohete en alcanzar la órbita con fondos privados. Otros receptores del premio incluyen a Neil Armstrong, Burt Rutan de Scaled Composites y John Glenn. 
Recibió el National Conservation Achievement Award del National Wildlife Federation por Tesla Motors y SolarCity.[137]​ 
Fue galardonado en la Aviation Week de 2008 por contar con el logro más significativo a nivel mundial en la industria espacial.[138]​ 
En junio de 2016, Business Insider nombró a Musk como uno de los «10 principales visionarios de negocios que crean valor para el mundo», junto con Mark Zuckerberg y Sal Khan.[139]​ En diciembre de ese año Musk ocupó el puesto 21 en la lista de Forbes de las personas más poderosas del mundo.[140]​ 
El 25 de enero de 2015 fue presentado el capítulo número 12 (564 del total de la serie) de la 26ª temporada de la serie animada Los Simpson, llamado The Musk Who Fell to Earth (en español, El almizcle que cayó en la Tierra), en la cual Elon Musk fue presentado como estrella invitada, interpretándose a sí mismo. En esta historia, Musk se representa a sí mismo como un hombre que tras haber prestado sus ideas en pos de la evolución de la industria automotriz (sin hacer alusión necesaria a la firma Tesla, Inc.), decide recorrer el país a bordo de una nave espacial con la cual aterriza en el jardín de la familia Simpson. Rápidamente, Musk y Homer se hacen amigos debido a que algunas reflexiones de este último estimulan nuevas ideas en el joven inventor. Homer lo lleva a la planta nuclear de Springfield donde rápidamente Elon desplaza de su posición a Montgomery Burns, provocando que la planta sea cerrada y generando el descontento en la sociedad. 
Posteriormente a la emisión de este capítulo, Musk se mostró disconforme con una expresión al finalizar el mismo, donde Lisa expresa tras su partida que «Para un hombre que gusta de los autos eléctricos, su nave quemaba mucho combustible». Tal broma recibió la respuesta de Elon quien expresó que:  Leyó muchísimos libros, entre ellos de Nietzsche, Schopenhauer y la Guía del autoestopista galáctico.[23]​ Musk se ha descrito a sí mismo como un adicto al trabajo que dedica por lo general entre 80 y 100 horas semanales a su trabajo en Tesla y SpaceX. De media duerme entre 6 horas y 6 horas y media al día. En las raras ocasiones en las que tiene tiempo libre, lo pasa jugando con sus hijos. Tiene gemelos y trillizos que se llevan dos años entre ellos.[144]​[88]​[23]​ 
Políticamente, Musk se ha descrito como medio demócrata y medio republicano.  En 2018 afirmó que no era conservador. «Estoy registrado como votante independiente y soy políticamente moderado.»[146]​ Debido al aumento de la automatización y la inteligencia artificial, Musk apoya la renta básica universal.[147]​ También apoya la democracia directa.[148]​ Se ha descrito a sí mismo como socialista. 
Musk ha dicho que Estados Unidos es el mejor país que nunca ha existido en la Tierra, que la democracia no existiría si no fuera por los Estados Unidos, ya que previno su desaparición en las dos guerras mundiales y en la guerra fría. También afirmó que sería un error decir que Estados Unidos es perfecto, porque no lo es, y que Estados Unidos ha hecho cosas malas y estúpidas.[150]​[151]​ 
Antes de la elección de Donald Trump como Presidente de los Estados Unidos, Musk le criticó diciendo:  Tras la toma de posesión de Trump, Musk aceptó participar en unos consejos consultivos para Trump.[153]​[154]​ 
En junio de 2017 y en protesta por la decisión de Trump de retirar a los Estados Unidos del acuerdo de París sobre cambio climático, Musk renunció a su participación en los consejos consultivos diciendo: «El cambio climático es real. Abandonar París no es bueno para Estados Unidos ni para el mundo.»[155]​[156]​ 
En agosto de 2019 Musk apoyó en Twitter al candidato presidencial, en las primarias demócratas por la nominación, Andrew Yang, cuyo programa giraba en torno al problema del desplazamiento del trabajo por la automatización y la inteligencia artificial. Musk dijo en un tuit que la renta básica universal es «obviamente necesaria».""[157]​ 
Tras comprar la red social Twitter, se le acusa de eliminar las cuentas de activistas, periodistas y grupos de izquierda.[158]​ 
En una entrevista Musk dijo que era un donante significativo del partido Demócrata, pero que también donaba bastante al partido Republicano. También afirmó que las donaciones a partidos políticos eran un requerimiento para tener una voz para hablar al gobierno de Estados Unidos.[159]​[160]​ 
Un informe de 2012 de la Sunlight Foundation, una fundación independiente que investiga el gasto del gobierno, halló que desde 2002 SpaceX había gastado más de 4 millones de USD en grupos de presión del Congreso de Estados Unidos y más de 800 000 USD en contribuciones a los demócratas y a los republicanos. La campaña de SpaceX para ganar apoyo político fue sistemático y sofisticado, y a diferencia de la mayoría de startups SpaceX ha mantenido una presencia significativa en los grupos de presión en Washington desde el primer día y Musk donó unos 725 000 USD a varias campañas desde 2002. 
En 2004 contribuyó con 2000 USD a la campaña de reelección de George W. Bush, con 100 000 USD[161]​ a la campaña de reelección de Barack Obama y donó 5000 USD al senador republicano Marco Rubio, que representa a Florida, un estado crítico para la industria espacial. En conjunto, Musk y SpaceX donaron unos 250 000 USD en ciclo de elecciones de 2012.[159]​[162]​ 
Además SpaceX contrató al anterior líder republicano de la mayoría en el Senado Trent Lott para representar a la compañía a través del grupo de presión Patton Boggs LLP. Además SpaceX emplea otros grupos de lobby.[163]​ 
Preguntado si creía en algún tipo de destino, distinto de la física, en la transición de la humanidad para ser una especie multiplanetaria, Musk respondió: 
Como posible solución a la paradoja de Fermi que pregunta dónde están los extraterrestres, Musk ha considerado la hipótesis de la simulación. 
En 1994 compró por 1400 USD un viejo BMW 320i de 1978 que arregló él mismo. Lo tuvo unos dos años hasta que tuvo un accidente al soltarse una rueda cuando lo conducía un empleado de Zip2.[168]​
Cuando trabajaba en Zip2 se compró un Jaguar E-Type de 1967.[168]​ 
En 1999, tras vender Zip2, Elon compró un McLaren F1 de un millón de dólares que utilizaba todos los días. Mientras Elon conducía Peter Thiel le preguntó que qué podía hacer el coche. Musk dijo «¡mira esto!» mientras aceleraba y cambiaba de carril. Como el coche no tenía control de tracción inició un trompo que invadió los carriles contrarios, salió de la calzada volando para caer destrozando la carrocería, suspensión y cristales. Musk salió del coche riéndose y Thiel le preguntó de qué se reía. Musk le dijo: ""No sabes lo mejor. El coche no está asegurado"".[169]​[42]​
El McLaren F1 contaba con un motor V-12 de 6.1 litros y 627 caballos, tenía carrocería de fibra de carbono. Solo se fabricaron 64 unidades. Afortunadamente Elon y su acompañante, Peter Thiel, cofundador de PayPal, salieron ilesos. Probablemente a partir de ese accidente tuvo como prioridad crear los coches más seguros del mundo.[170]​ Tras reparar el McLaren F1 lo vendió más adelante para obtener efectivo.[42]​
El McLaren F1 era capaz de alcanzar los 100 km/h en 3,2 segundos. En la presentación del Tesla Model S P85D Elon dijo que había igualado la marca del 0 a 100 km/h en 3,2 segundos del McLaren F1. En 2016 el Tesla Model S P100D consiguió romper esa marca y establecerla en 2,28 segundos, convirtiéndolo en el coche de serie más rápido del mundo en aceleración.[171]​ 
En junio de 2019, Musk insinuó que el diseño de un vehículo anfibio basado en el que hizo Wet Nellie para el coche submarino en la película de James Bond La espía que me amó (1977) podría ser posible.[172]​[173]​ Musk compró en 2013 el coche de Wet Nellie en una subasta de Sotheby's por casi un millón de dólares[174]​ y en 2019 lo expuso en la presentación del Tesla Cybertruck. 
También tuvo un Audi Q7 del que no le gustaba el acceso a la tercera fila de asientos. Eso fue un acicate para diseñar las puertas de ala de gaviota del Tesla Model X.[168]​ 
En 2007 tenía un Hamann BMW M5.[168]​ 
En 2012 tenía un Porsche 911.[168]​ 
En 2017 un amigo le regaló un Ford Model T.[168]​ 
En 2018 lanzó al espacio su Tesla Roadster en un cohete Falcon Heavy de SpaceX y estará millones de años orbitando al Sol.[168]​ 
También tiene un Tesla Model S, Tesla Model X y Tesla Model 3 Performance. 
En 2010 la fábrica de SpaceX se usó para la filmación de Iron Man 2 y Musk hace un cameo en la película.[175]​ 
En 2013 tiene un cameo en Machete Kills, y aparecen las instalaciones de SpaceX.[176]​ 
En 2014 aparece en la película de ciencia ficción Transcendence.[176]​ 
En 2015 da voz a su personaje en el episodio de Los Simpson titulado The Musk Who Fell to Earth en el que Elon Musk va a Springfield y Homer le sugiere una idea que podría revolucionar la ciudad, pero que al final termina costándole una fortuna al señor Burns.[176]​ 
En 2015 tiene un cameo en la serie The Big Bang Theory, en el capítulo 9 de la novena temporada, The Platonic Permutation, interpretándose a sí mismo. 
En 2016 aparece como él mismo en la película ¿Por qué él?, protagonizada por James Franco y Bryan Cranston, en la que asiste a una fiesta que da lugar en la película. 
En 2014 aparece en la serie South Park en el episodio Handicar solo como una referencia. Pero ya más tarde en 2016 aparece en los episodios “Members only"", “Not funny"" y “El fin de la seriealizacion tal como la conocemos"" interpretandose a sí mismo. 
En 2017 tiene un cameo en la serie El joven Sheldon, en el capítulo 6 de la primera temporada, Un parche, un módem y un Zantac, como él mismo.[177]​ 
En 2019 aparece en el capítulo 3 de la cuarta temporada de Rick & Morty ""One Crew Over the Crewcoo's Morty"", interpretando a una versión de sí mismo de un universo alternativo en la que los humanos tienen grandes colmillos llamado Elon Tusk. 
El 12 de agosto de 2013 propuso el sistema Hyperloop como un sistema que permitiría transportar personas entre San Francisco y Los Ángeles en 35 minutos. Actualmente los 563 kilómetros se pueden recorrer en coche en unas 5 horas y media por las carreteras existentes.[178]​[23]​ 
Hyperloop es un modo de transporte nuevo que busca cambiar el paradigma actual al ser rápido y barato para personas y mercancías. Hyperloop es un concepto de diseño abierto, similar a GNU/Linux, en el que las aportaciones de la comunidad pueden hacer avanzar el diseño y hacerlo una realidad. Es un sistema rápido, barato, con salidas casi inmediatas para el viajero y sostenible ambientalmente.[179]​ 
Consiste en un tubo que contiene aire a baja presión por el que unas cápsulas circulan sobre un colchón de aire. El morro de la cápsula contiene un compresor eléctrico que transfiere alta presión de aire desde el morro a la cola de la cápsula. El compresor proporciona levitación y en menor grado propulsión.[179]​ 
El proyecto entre San Francisco y Los Ángeles con dos tubos está cubierto por paneles solares en el techo que generarían más de la energía que necesita para operar. Los paneles solares tendrían una anchura de 4,25 m y cubrirían una distancia de 563 km. Con una producción de energía solar de 120 W/m² se esperaría que el sistema produciría un pico máximo de 285
MW de producción solar. 
El sistema en conjunto consumiría una media de 21
MW. Esto incluye la energía necesaria para la propulsión, resistencia aerodinámica, recarga de baterías y bombas de vacío. Los paneles solares proporcionarían una media de 57
MW, que es más que suficiente para operar el Hyperloop.[179]​ 
El coste total sería de 6000 millones de dólares para la versión sencilla y de 7500 millones de dólares para la versión grande con capacidad de transportar coches. Amortizando este capital en veinte años y añadiendo los costes de operación cada billete sencillo saldría por unos 20 USD.[179]​ 
La versión sencilla de Hyperloop costaría un 9 % de lo que costaría el tren de alta velocidad entre Los Ángeles y San Francisco.[179]​ 
En enero de 2015 Elon Musk anunció que se construiría una pista de pruebas para el Hyperloop en Texas para que compañías y estudiantes probaran sus diseños.[180]​ 
Tuvo un avión checo Aero L-39 que valía aproximadamente 250 000 dólares.[181]​ El avión Dassault Falcon 900 utilizado en la película, Gracias por fumar, está registrado a nombre de Musk. Musk figura como uno de los productores ejecutivos del filme.[182]​ 
El 30 de marzo de 2019, Musk lanzó un sencillo de rap a la plataforma musical SoundCloud bajo el nombre de usuario ""Emo G Records"".[183]​ Titulada ""RIP Harambe"", la canción fue interpretada por Yung Jake, escrita por Yung Jake y Caroline Polachek, y producida por BloodPop.[184]​[185]​ En diez días, la canción había logrado más de 2 000 000 reproducciones.[183]​ El 30 de enero de 2020, Musk lanzó una segunda canción a su perfil de SoundCloud titulada ""Don't Doubt Ur Vibe"".[186]​ 
Se cree que Musk es un fanático del girlgroup surcoreano Loona. Esto, luego de que Grimes, su actual pareja y quien ha colaborado con este grupo anteriormente, haya publicado en la red social Twitter cómo fue su experiencia en el estudio con las chicas.[187]​  
Elon, al cabo de un mes, respondió con un tuit con la palabra «Loona», estilizada en mayúsculas y con emoticonos de relámpagos en los extremos. Los fanáticos de Loona recibieron con entusiasmo el creciente interés de Musk por este grupo de K-Pop.[188]​ 
Además, se ha confirmado que Go Won, la undécima miembro de Loona, sería, según Grimes, la madrina del hijo de esta última y Elon, X Æ A-Xii Musk.[189]​ 
Los vehículos Tesla incluyen Easter Eggs (Huevos de Pascua): características o funciones escondidas o no documentadas incluidas como bromas en un programa informático. 
Musk bautizó el modo de aceleración superior del Tesla Model S como Ludicrous y el nivel posterior como Plaid, copiando las velocidades de las naves espaciales (Ludicrous Speed, Plaid Speed) en la comedia satírica Spaceballs (1987) de Mel Brooks.[190]​[191]​ Ludicrous Speed sería una velocidad superior a la velocidad de la luz en el que las estrellas visibles dejan una traza lineal, mientras que la Plaid Speed sería una velocidad todavía superior en el que las estrellas dejarían trazas longitudinales y transversales creando un patrón tartán (plaid) de listas cruzadas como en un kilt escocés. 
En los Tesla con Ludicrous si se aprieta el botón Ludicrous y se mantiene 3 segundos, la pantalla cambia y representa lo que sería ir en el espacio a una velocidad superior a la de la luz. Es una referencia a la película Spaceballs.[192]​ 
El volumen de sonido de los Tesla Model S y X llega hasta el nivel 11 en homenaje a una secuencia de la película de falso documental This is Spinal Tap (1984) dirigida por Rob Reiner.[193]​ En la película un músico muestra su amplificador en el que todos los diales llegan hasta 11. 
Los Tesla incorporan el Tesla Emissions Testing Mode (modo de control de emisiones) que produce sonidos de pedos en cualquiera de los asientos y se puede programar para que los produzca al poner el intermitente.[194]​ 
En SpaceX el primer lanzamiento de Dragon mandó como carga secreta un queso en homenaje a Monty Python.[25]​ 
En los Tesla si se cambia el nombre del vehículo a Patsy, Rabbit of Caerbannog, Mr. Creosote, Biggus Dickus o Unladen Swallow aparece el pie de Cupido y suena un pedo en referencia a Monty Python.[195]​[196]​ 
Desde octubre de 2018 todos los vehículos Tesla incorporan los viejos juegos de Atari: Missile Command, Asteroids, Lunar Lander y Centipede.[197]​ 
Desde septiembre de 2018 los Teslas con Autopilot pueden seleccionar el Modo Mad Max como el más agresivo para los cambios de carril automatizados. Es un homenaje a película Mad Max (1979) dirigida por George Miller.[198]​ 
Para el Tesla Model 3 diseñó un sofisticado depósito para el sistema de refrigeración bautizado Superbottle (Superbotella) que lleva impreso un dibujo de una botella con capa al estilo de los superhéroes.[199]​ 
En los vehículos Tesla cuando se activa el modo Centinela (Sentry Mode) aparece la imagen del ordenador HAL 9000 de la película 2001 una odisea del espacio, de Stanley Kubrick.[200]​ Se puede activar con el comando de voz Keep Summer Safe («Mantén segura a Summer») en referencia al episodio 6 de la temporada 2 de Rick and Morty, en la que Rick ordena a su vehículo que proteja a Summer (hermana de Morty), que se queda dentro del vehículo.[201]​ 
En los coches Tesla cuando el nombre del vehículo se cambia a «42» aparece el mensaje «Vida, el Universo y Todo». En el libro de Douglas Adams Guía del autoestopista galáctico se le pregunta al superordenador Deep Thought cuál es el significado de la vida y tras 7.5 millones de años responde: «42».[200]​ 
En los vehículos Tesla con suspensión neumática tras pulsar el logo T y escribir el código 007 sale el Lotus Esprit anfibio que apareció en la película de James Bond de 1977 The Spy Who Loved Me (El espía que me amó).[200]​ 
En los coches Tesla activando la palanca del Autopilot 4 veces se muestra la carretera con los colores del arco iris. Es una referencia al juego Mario Kart para Nintendo 64.[192]​ 
Cuando un coche Tesla tiene la batería cargada para una autonomía de 121 km y se abre la APP del teléfono aparecen múltiples referencias a la película de 1985 Back to the Future.[192]​ 
Si se aprieta el logo de Tesla durante 5 segundos y se introduce el código «MARS» la pantalla de navegación muestra lo que vería un vehículo circulando por Marte.[192]​ 
En un Tesla si se aprieta el icono de teléfono durante 3 segundos el texto cambia a Ahoy-Hoy que fue la frase propuesta por el inventor del teléfono Alexander Graham Bell para responder un teléfono. 
En noviembre de 2019 Musk presentó el Tesla Cybertruck, una camioneta pickup eléctrica. La presentación fue en Los Ángeles, la misma ciudad, el mismo mes y el mismo año que la película Blade Runner, en que se inspiró el diseño del Cybertruck.[202]​[203]​[204]​ 
En diciembre de 2000 se tomó unas vacaciones en Brasil y en una reserva de caza en Sudáfrica. En enero de 2001 volvió a California y a los pocos días empezó a sentirse mal. En un principio lo diagnosticaron con meningitis viral, enfermedad que trataron y le dieron el alta. Unos días después empeoró y lo trasladaron al Sequoia Hospital en Redwood City. Le diagnosticaron y trataron por malaria. Estando en la unidad de cuidados intensivos se encontró que la cepa correspondía a plasmodium falciparum, que es el más letal. Cambiaron el tratamiento a otro más agresivo que podía tener efectos secundarios peligrosos como arritmias y fallo orgánico. Estuvo a punto de morir, perdió 20 kilos y tardó 6 meses en recuperarse totalmente.[42]​ 
Musk vive en Bel-Air, California. En 2000 Elon se casó con su primera esposa, la autora canadiense Justine Wilson, a la que conoció cuando ambos eran estudiantes en la Universidad de Queen.[205]​ En 2002 tuvieron un hijo llamado Nevada Alexander Musk, quien a las diez semanas falleció por el síndrome de muerte súbita.[42]​ Musk y Wilson tienen cinco hijos: un par de gemelos y unos trillizos. Se separaron en el año 2008.  
Ese mismo año conoció a la actriz británica Talulah Riley. Se casaron en 2010 y se divorciaron en 2012. Se volvieron a casar en 2013 y terminaron por separarse legalmente.[25]​[206]​ En noviembre de 2017 terminó su relación con la actriz Amber Heard debido a sus conflictos de agendas.[25]​[207]​[208]​  
El 7 de mayo de 2018, Musk comenzó a salir con la cantante canadiense Grimes y en enero de 2020 anunciaron que estaban esperando su primer hijo. El 4 de mayo de 2020 nació su hijo, X AE A-XII Musk. La pareja anunció su separación en septiembre de 2021, y desde entonces la cantante describió su vínculo sentimental con Musk como «fluido». En marzo de 2022 se hizo público que había nacido su segunda hija biológica con Grimes, Exa Dark Sideræl, en diciembre de 2021 por gestación subrogada. En septiembre de 2023 confirmaron públicamente a su tercer hijo en común, Tau Techno Mecanicus, nacido a mediados de junio de 2022. Su existencia había sido mantenida en secreto por la pareja, y la noticia se conoció a raíz de la publicación de la biografía de Musk.[209]​[210]​  
En julio de 2022, Insider hizo público que había tenido gemelos con Shivon Zilis, directora de operaciones y proyectos especiales en Neuralink, nacidos en noviembre de 2021.[211]​[212]​ El número total de hijos de Musk asciende a diez;[4]​ el empresario ha declarado que esta es una decisión deliberada para combatir la caída de la natalidad y descenso de la población, un fenómeno que considera una amenaza para la civilización.[210]​ 
Kimbal Musk es consejero de Tesla, Inc. y SpaceX. A su vez es el fideicomisario de Elon en el caso de que su hermano quedara incapacitado.[36]​ 
Mientras participaba Saturday Night Live, en mayo de 2021, Musk afirmó tener síndrome de Asperger.[213]​ 
En octubre de 2008, después de que Musk confirmara que Tesla Motors se estaba quedando sin dinero en efectivo,[214]​[215]​ salió a la luz que había contratado a una empresa externa de ITC para revisar todos los correos electrónicos y mensajes instantáneos de Tesla. Posteriormente, un investigador forense tomó huellas digitales de impresiones que habían sido descartadas cerca de la fotocopiadora que se utilizó para filtrar el correo electrónico. La investigación indicó que el empleado responsable de publicar el mensaje donde se indicaba el estado financiero de la empresa fue Peng Zhou. Musk ofreció a Zhou la opción de disculparse con la compañía y renunciar, opción que tomó para evitar ser enjuiciado.[216]​ 
El 26 de mayo de 2009, el ex director ejecutivo de Tesla Motors, Martin Eberhard, presentó una denuncia en el Condado de San Mateo, California, en contra de Tesla Motors y Musk por difamación e incumplimiento de contrato. El caso se basaba sobre la cuestión de quién debería ser llamado el verdadero fundador de Tesla.[217]​ El 29 de julio de 2009, un juez de la Corte Superior del Condado de San Mateo descartó la solicitud de Eberhard que pedía ser declarado como uno de los dos únicos fundadores de la compañía.[217]​ Tesla indicó en un comunicado que la resolución era ""consistente con la creencia de Tesla en un equipo de fundadores, que incluyen el actual director ejecutivo Elon Musk y el CTO JB Straubel, quienes fueron fundamentales en la creación de Tesla desde su concepción.""[218]​ 
A principios de agosto, Eberhard abandonó el caso,[219]​ y las partes llegaron a un acuerdo el 21 de septiembre. Aunque los términos del acuerdo son confidenciales, éste incluía una provisión en la que las partes consideraban a Eberhard, Musk, JB Straubel, Marc Tarpenning e Ian Wright como los cinco cofundadores de Tesla Motors.[220]​ 
En 2018 Musk anunció la creación de un proyecto llamado “Pravda” (o Pravduh), que en ruso significa “Verdad” que evaluaría la credibilidad de los medios de comunicación y las noticias falsas. Este anuncio llegó tras sus polémicas con distintos periodistas en las redes sociales, concretamente tras señalar que los medios de comunicación estarían -según Elon Musk- bajo presión de las compañías petroleras y automovilistas mediante pagos por publicidad.[221]​ 
Durante un debate en las redes sociales, Elon Musk fue acusado de antisemitismo por algunos usuarios de internet y periodistas después de que este respondiera a un mensaje del periodista Joshua Topolsky en el que este explicaba a Elon como unas “personas poderosas” controlaban las encuestas, a lo que Elon Musk respondió que las mismas “personas poderosas” que controlaban las encuestas, también controlaban los medios de comunicación. Esto fue malinterpretado por algunos usuarios de las redes sociales, personalidades y periodistas, obligando a Elon Musk a dar una explicación de la situación en profundidad.[222]​ 
El 7 de agosto de 2018 Elon publicó los tuits: 
La SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) presentó cargos contra Elon Musk alegando que la potencial transacción no era segura y dependía de numerosas contingencias. Musk no había acordado los detalles del acuerdo con los potenciales socios financieros, y sus afirmaciones no se correspondían con los hechos. La SEC afirmó que los tuits engañosos hicieron subir las acciones de Tesla un 6 % el 7 de agosto, causando una disrupción en el mercado. El 29 de septiembre de 2018 Musk y Tesla llegaron a un acuerdo sin admitir o negar las alegaciones de la SEC que requería que: 
El 4 de octubre de 2018 Elon escribió el tuit:  Esto hacía referencia a los ataques en bolsa de los vendedores en corto que apostaban por el hundimiento del valor de las acciones de Tesla. El 21 de mayo de 2019 el 31 % de las acciones disponibles de Tesla estaban atacadas en corto.[224]​ 
Los ataques en corto se produjeron durante años y en unos niveles sin precedentes en la bolsa sin que la SEC abriera una investigación y pusiera límites.[225]​ 
En un programa del programa 60 minutes emitido en 2018 afirmó: 
[226]​ 
El 20 de febrero de 2019 a las 1:15 AM escribió el tuit:  Y a las 5:41 AM escribió el tuit:  La SEC aprovechó esta oportunidad para demandarle el 25 de febrero de 2019 por desacato e incuplimiento del acuerdo de septiembre de 2018 ya que esos tuits no habían sido aprobados con antelación por el abogado de Tesla. El 30 de abril de 2019 la jueza impuso una enmienda al acuerdo de septiembre de 2018 por el que el abogado de Tesla debería aprobar con antelación todas las comunicaciones escritas públicas de Elon Musk que contuvieran información de: 
En julio de 2018 Musk intentó asistir a los rescatadores durante el rescate de la cueva de Than Luang dirigiendo a sus empleados en la fabricación de una pequeña cápsula de rescate con un diámetro de 38 cm en la que cupiera un niño. Musk, respondiendo a las peticiones de usuarios de Twitter,[227]​ se comunicó con el gobierno tailandés.[228]​ Organizó el trabajo de ingenieros de sus empresas para que diseñaran contrarreloj un pequeño submarino para ayudar en el rescate y documentó todo el proceso en Twitter.[229]​[230]​ Richard Stanton, director del equipo de rescate internacional también urgió a Musk para la construcción del minisubmarino como respaldo en el caso de que la inundación empeorara.[231]​
Ingenieros de SpaceX y The Boring Company fabricaron el minisubmarino en un día partiendo de un tubo de transferencia de oxígeno líquido de un cohete Falcon 9[232]​ y lo trasladaron a Tailandia.[233]​ Lo bautizaron ""Wild Boar"" como el equipo de fútbol de los niños.[234]​ Su diseño, basado en las aportaciones del equipo de buceo, era un tubo de 150 cm de largo y 30 cm de diámetro que pesaba 41 kg. Se propulsaba manualmente por los buzos y tenía compartimentos para colocar pesas de buceo y ajustar la flotabilidad,[235]​ con la intención de transportar con seguridad a los niños que podrían tener dificultades para aprender las técnicas de buceo requeridas para salir de la cueva sin entrar en pánico. Para el caso en que el minisubmarino no cupiera en algunos tramos de la cueva, Elon Musk pidió a la empresa californiana de botes hinchables que construyera cápsulas de escape inflables.[236]​[237]​ Cuando llegó el minisubmarino a Tailandia 8 de los 12 niños ya habían sido rescatados usando anestesia, máscaras de buceo y oxígeno.[238]​[239]​[240]​ Las autoridades tailandesas decidieron no usar el submarino.[241]​[242]​[243]​ En marzo de 2019 Elon Musk fue galardonado por el rey de Tailandia con la Orden de Direkgunabhorn (Member of the Order of the Direkgunabhorn) por sus contribuciones y las de su equipo en la misión de rescate.[244]​ 
El supervisor de la operación de rescate, Narongsak Osatanakorn, afirmó que el submarino era tecnológicamente sofisticado, pero no encajaba en la misión para entrar en la cueva.[245]​[246]​ Vernon Unsworth, un espeológo aficionado que había estado 6 años explorando la cueva y que asesoró en el rescate, criticó en la CNN que el submarino no era más que una operación publicitaria porque no tenía posibilidad de éxito y que Musk no comprendía cómo eran los pasadizos de la cueva.[247]​[248]​[249]​ Y que además  Musk afirmó en Twitter que el aparato habría funcionado y se refirió a Vemon Unsworth como ""pedo guy"" (tipo pedófilo), lo que causó reacciones contra Musk.[250]​[251]​ Musk borró los tuits. También borró un tuit en que a un crítico del aparato le dijo 
[251]​ El 16 de julio de 2018 Unsworth afirmó que estaba considerando emprender acciones legales contra los comentarios de Musk.[252]​[253]​ Dos días después Musk pidió perdón por sus comentarios.[254]​[255]​[256]​[257]​
El 28 de agosto de 2018 en respuesta a una crítica desde Twitter, Musk escribió el tuit:  [258]​ Al día siguiente se hizo pública una carta del abogado Lin Wood fechada el 6 de agosto que mostraba que estaba preparando una demanda de difamación.[259]​[260]​ Un autoproclamado investigador privado mandó un correo electrónico a Musk con la oferta de buscar basura en el pasado de Unsworth. Musk aceptó la oferta en agosto de 2018 y le pagó 50 000 USD.[261]​ Más tarde se supo que el investigador era un delincuente condenado por delitos de fraude.[262]​ El 30 de agosto, usando detalles de la presunta investigación,[263]​[264]​ Musk mandó a un periodista de BuzzFeed News, que había escrito sobre la controversia, un correo electrónico encabezado «Off the record» en el que afirmaba que Unsworth era un:  Lo último fue desmentido por la pareja de Unswoth. El 5 de septiembre el reportero publicó en un tuit una copia del correo electrónico diciendo que el «off the record» era un acuerdo entre dos y él no lo había acordado.[265]​ A mediados de septiembre Unsworth presentó una demanda en un juzgado federal de Los Ángeles.[266]​[267]​ 
En su defensa Musk argumentó que en lenguaje coloquial ""pedo guy"" era un insulto común en Sudáfrica donde creció sinónimo de ""viejo siniestro"" y se usa para insultar la apariencia y el comportamiento. El diccionario Dictionary of Contemporary Slang define el término ""pedo"" como  [268]​[269]​ El caso de difamación, en el que Unsworth reclamaba 190 millones de dólares, empezó el 4 de diciembre de 2019 en Los Ángeles.[270]​ Durante el juicio Musk pidió perdón a Unsworth otra vez por el tuit original. El 6 de diciembre el jurado determinó que Musk no era culpable de difamación.[271]​[272]​ 
En el programa 1169 del podcast The Joe Rogan Experience del 7 de septiembre de 2018, Elon le recomendó a Rogan, un fanático de los coches rápidos, que comprara un Tesla Model S P100D Ludicrous, cosa que hizo al poco tiempo. Elon bebió whisky. Rogan le invitó a fumar marihuana y Elon fumó una calada. El uso de marihuana para usos recreativos es legal en California, donde se realizó la entrevista.[167]​
Musk publicó el tuit: 
La entrevista tuvo un impacto negativo en su imagen, la de Tesla y la de SpaceX.[273]​ 
El día 24 de julio del 2020, Musk publicó un tuit sobre los debates en torno a un paquete de medidas sociales en Estados Unidos diciendo: ""Otro paquete de estímulo del gobierno no está en el mejor interés de la gente de la OMI. Como recordatorio, estoy a favor del ingreso básico universal"". De entre todas las respuestas recibidas, un usuario de Twitter de nombre ""Armani"" le respondió: ""¿Sabes lo que no era lo mejor para la gente? El gobierno de los Estados Unidos organizó un golpe de estado contra Evo Morales en Bolivia para que pudieras obtener el litio allí"".[274]​ Esto llevó a que Musk respondiera el 25 de julio: ""Daremos un golpe de Estado a quien queramos"" [275]​ aseverando luego que su compañía obtenía litio de Australia.[276]​ Esta respuesta llevó a que diversos políticos de izquierda acusaran a Musk de estar detrás de la crisis política en Bolivia, que posee yacimientos de litio, mientras que otros vieron en su respuesta una respuesta sarcástica[275]​ 
Musk ha difundido desinformación sobre la pandemia de COVID-19,[277]​[278]​ incluida la promoción de la cloroquina como tratamiento contra el virus y afirmando que las estadísticas de fallecimientos eran manipuladas por investigadores y médicos por motivos financieros.[279]​[280]​ Al comienzo de la pandemia, afirmó que los niños son ""esencialmente inmunes"" al coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.[281]​ Musk criticó repetidamente los confinamientos y violó los protocolos locales al reabrir una fábrica de Tesla en Fremont, California.[282]​ En marzo de 2020, al comentar un informe del New York Times de que China no había informado de nuevos casos de propagación interna del nuevo coronavirus, Musk predijo que habría ""probablemente cerca de cero nuevos casos en EE. UU. También a finales de abril"".[283]​ Más tarde, Politico calificó esta declaración como ""una de las predicciones más audaces, seguras y espectacularmente incorrectas de 2020.[284]​ En noviembre de 2020, tuiteó información errónea sobre la efectividad de las pruebas de COVID-19.[285]​ En abril de 2021, tuiteó una versión modificada de una tira cómica de Ben Garrison con una caricatura de Bill Gates y un mensaje antivacunas.[286]​ 
Para junio del 2022, Musk fue acusado de presunta estafa piramidal, en el que promocionó información relacionada con comprar Dogecoin.[287]​ 
En el 2023, Musk propuso pelear contra Mark Zuckerberg, el fundador de Facebook.[288]​ 
En octubre de 2023 Elon Musk ofreció 1.000 millones de dólares por cambiar el nombre de Wikipedia a (dickipedia). Aprovechó un mensaje de recaudación de donaciones para atacar a Jimmy Wales y burlarse de su plataforma.[289]​

Hal tersebut menyusul peringatan dari Komisi Eropa soal aturan Digital Act Services (DSA).

Komisioner Eropa untuk pasar internal, Thierry Breton, menyurati langsung para bos-bos raksasa teknologi, termasuk Elon Musk. Hal itu menyusul konflik yang pecah di Timur Tengah, antara kelompok Hamas dan Israel.   X dan layanan internet lainnya diduga turut membuat panas situasi yang terjadi karena banyaknya konten sesat tersebar melalui platform mereka.  Dilaporkan Insider, Jumat (20/10/2023), Musk sangat frustasi dengan tuntutan utnuk memenuhi aturan DSA, kata seorang sumber dalam.   Sumber tersebut mengatakan Musk berencana angkat kaki dari wilayah Eropa, sebab merasa tak bisa memenuhi aturan DSA yang berlaku di pasar tersebut.   Jika benar, hal ini serupa dengan yang dilakukan Meta. Anak aplikasinya yang terbaru, Threads, diblokir dari warga di Eropa.  Kekhawatiran Musk kena denda 6% bukan tak beralasan. Pasalnya, sulit mematuhi aturan DSA ketika mayoritas divisi 'Trust and Safety' di perusahaan yang bertugas memoderasi konten telah di-PHK.  Musk dan perwakilan X tak merespons permintaan untuk mengonfirmasi kabar ini. Kendati begitu, Musk sesumbar di akun X personalnya bahwa laporan Insider salah.  Perwakilan Komisi Eropa juga menolak berkomentar. Namun, dalam peringatan terbaru yang diajukan ke Facebook dan TikTok, tak ada surat yang diberikan ke X. "

Elon Reeve Musk (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman and investor. Musk is the founder, chairman, CEO and chief technology officer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, product architect and former chairman of Tesla, Inc.; owner, chairman and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company and xAI; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation. He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$211 billion as of October 2023[update], according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $234 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX.[5][6] 
Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics there. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. However, Musk dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999, and with $12 million of the money he made, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.  
In October 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same year, with $100 million of the money he made, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company. In 2004, he became an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar-energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year, Musk co-founded Neuralink—a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces—and the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently merged the company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, he founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.[7] 
Musk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including spreading COVID-19 misinformation and promoting antisemitic and far-right conspiracy theories.[8][9][10] His Twitter ownership has been similarly controversial, including laying off a large number of employees, an increase in hate speech on the platform,[11][12] and changes to Twitter Blue verification.[13][14] In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued him for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case, Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine. 
Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[15][16] He has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[17][18] His mother, Maye Musk (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[19][20][21] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer, who partly owned a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika, as well as a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[22][23][24][25] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.[21][26] 
Musk's family was wealthy during his youth.[25] His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[15] His maternal grandfather and namesake, Joshua Elon Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane.[27][28][29][30] Haldeman was a member of the Social Credit Party of Canada, possessed antisemitic beliefs, and supported the Technocracy movement.[31] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk chose to live primarily with his father.[17][22] Musk later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[32] He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.[27][33] 
Musk was often bullied. In one incident, after calling a boy whose father had committed suicide ""stupid"", Musk was severely beaten and thrown down concrete steps.[34] He was also an enthusiast reader of books, attributing his success in part to having read Benjamin Franklin: An American Life, Lord of the Flies,  the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[35][36] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[37] At age twelve, Musk sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[38][39] 
Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and Pretoria Boys High School, from where he graduated.[40] Musk was a good but not exceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[41] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother,[42][43] knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.[44] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[45] 
Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,[46] working odd jobs at a farm and lumber mill.[47] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[48][49] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School.[50][51][52][53] Although Musk claims he earned the degrees in 1995, UPenn maintains it awarded them in 1997.[54] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[55] 
In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[56][57] In 1995, he was accepted to a PhD program in materials science at Stanford University.[58][59] However, Musk decided to join the Internet boom, dropping out two days after being accepted and applied for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[60][42] 
In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link, later renamed to Zip2.[61][62] The company was financed mainly through a financing round of US$200,000, of which 10% was contributed by his father Errol Musk.[63] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[64] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[65] with Musk coding the website every night.[65] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[55] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[66] however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[67] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[68][69] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[70] 
Later in 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.[71] X.com was one of the first federally insured online banks, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.[72] Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[73] 
In 2000, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition,[65][73][74] as the latter's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[75] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[76] With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[77][b] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[79][80] 
In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million.[81][82] In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its ""sentimental value"".[83][84] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating ""X, the everything app"".[85] 
In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[86] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[87] and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[87] With $100 million of his own money,[88] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.[89][90] 
SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[91] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA Administrator (and former SpaceX consultant[92]) Mike Griffin later that year.[93][94] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt,[91] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[95] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[96] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[97] 
Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on an inland platform.[98] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[99] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[100][101] Since 2019,[102] SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.[103] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[104] 
In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access,[105] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[106] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.[107][c] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.[110][111][112] 
During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine to provide Internet access and communication.[113] However, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself ""a free speech absolutist"".[114][115] In October 2022, Musk stated that about 20,000 satellite terminals had been donated to Ukraine, together with free data transfer subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80 million. After asking the United States Department of Defense to pay for further units and future subscriptions on behalf of Ukraine,[116] Musk publicly stated that SpaceX would continue to provide Starlink to Ukraine for free, at a yearly cost to itself of $400 million.[117][118][119] 
Tesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[120] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[121] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design,but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[122] 
Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[123][page needed][124] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[125] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[126][127] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[128] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to ""Technoking"" while retaining his position as CEO.[129] 
Tesla began delivery of an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[130] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.[131] A cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015.[132] A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[133] The Model 3 is the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[134][135] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020.[136] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019.[137] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.[138] 
Since its initial public offering in 2010,[139] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[140][141] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[142][143] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.[144] In November 2021, Musk proposed, on Twitter, to sell 10% of his Tesla stock, since ""much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance"".[145] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week,[145] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[146] In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Elon and Kimbal Musk were under investigation by the SEC for possible insider trading related to the sale.[147] In 2022, Musk unveiled a robot developed by Tesla, Optimus.[148] On June 20, 2023, Musk met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York City, suggesting that he might be interested in investing in India ""as soon as humanly possible"".[149] 
In 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet claiming that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[150][d] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[150][154][155] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[156] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[157][158] In April 2022, the shareholder who sued Musk over the tweet, along with several Tesla shareholders, said that a federal judge had ruled that the tweet was false, although the ruling in question has not been unsealed.[159] In February 2023, the jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.[160] 
In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.[161] The SEC reacted to Musk's tweet by filing in court, asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a tweet; the accusation was disputed by Musk. This was eventually settled by a joint agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement details.[162] The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need preclearance before tweeting about.[163] In 2020, a judge prevented a lawsuit from proceeding that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (""too high imo"") violated the agreement.[164][165] FOIA-released records showed that the SEC itself concluded Musk has subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding ""Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price"".[166] 
Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[167] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[168] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[169] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.[170][171] 
Tesla acquired SolarCity for over $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price. At the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[172] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, claiming that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[173][174] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[175][176] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.[177] 
In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100 million.[178][179] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain to facilitate its merging with machines. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.[179][180] The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries.[181] 
In 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[178] He is listed as the sole author of an October 2019 paper that details some of Neuralink's research,[182] although Musk's being listed as such rankled the Neuralink team's researchers.[183] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as ""a Fitbit in your skull"" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims,[184][185][186] with MIT Technology Review describing them as ""highly speculative"" and ""neuroscience theater"".[184] During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.[181] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[187] 
Neuralink has conducted further animal testing on macaque monkeys at the University of California, Davis' Primate Research Center. In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink implant. The company's animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of animal cruelty. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink's animal trials have violated the Animal Welfare Act.[188] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[189] 
In September 2023, the company was approved to intitiate human trials; the company will conduct a six-year study.[190] 
In 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[191][192] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep ""test trench"" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits.[193] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[194] 
Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled.[195][196] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[197] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[198] In 2021, tunnel construction was approved for Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[199]

April 14, 2022[200] 
Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017,[201] and had questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of speech.[202][203] Additionally, his ex-wife Talulah Riley had urged him to buy Twitter to stop the ""woke-ism"".[204] In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April,[205] making him the largest shareholder.[206][e] When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013 IPO.[208] On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[209][210] However, on April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share.[206][211] In response, Twitter's board adopted a ""poison pill"" shareholder rights plan to make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval.[212] Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[213] This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21 billion in equity financing.[214][215] 
Tesla's stock market value sank by over $100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal.[216][217] He subsequently tweeted criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde's policies to his 86 million followers, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.[218] Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was ""on hold"" following a report that 5% of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts.[219] Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition,[220] he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter's Board of Directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction.[221] On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter.[222] In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.[223] The acquisition was officially completed on October 27.[224] 
Immediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal;[224][225] Musk became the CEO instead.[226] He instituted a $7.99 monthly subscription for a ""blue check"",[227][228][13] and laid off a significant portion of the company's staff.[229][230] Musk lessened content moderation, including reinstating accounts like the Bee,[231][232] and in December, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter's moderation of Hunter Biden's laptop controversy in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election.[233] The Southern Poverty Law Center noted that Twitter has verified numerous extremists;[14] hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover.[11][234] 
In late 2022, Musk promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll posted by Musk found that majority of user wanted him to do so.[235][236] Five months later, Musk stepped down from CEO and placed former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino in the position and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer.[237] 
Musk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a ""nano-manager"".[238] The New York Times has characterized his approach as absolutist.[239] Musk does not make formal business plans;[239] instead, he says he prefers to approach engineering problems[non sequitur] with an ""iterative design methodology"" and ""tolerance for failures"".[240] He has forced employees to adopt the company's own jargon and launched ambitious, risky, and costly projects against his advisors' recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot. His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX's rocket,[241] vertical integration has caused many usability problems for Tesla's software.[238] 
Musk's handling of employees—whom he communicates with directly through mass emails—has been characterized as ""carrot and stick"", rewarding those ""who offer constructive criticism"" while also being known to impulsively threaten, swear at, and fire his employees.[242][243][244] Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes for 80 hours per week.[245] He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees,[246][247] such as during the Model 3 ""production hell"" in 2018.[247] In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla's workforce, due to his concerns about the economy.[248] That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.[249] 
Musk's leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors,[238] and criticized by others, who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as ""show[ing] a lack of human understanding.""[244][250] The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.[251] The Wall Street Journal reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as ""self-driving"", he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer ""lives at risk"", with some employees resigning in consequence.[252] 
Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[253][254] whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and ""safe artificial intelligence""); and support science and engineering educational efforts.[255] 
As of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal's non-profit Big Green.[256] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25 million directly to non-profit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI,[257] which was a non-profit at the time.[258] 
In 2012, Musk took the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will.[259] He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation, including $100 million to reward improved carbon capture technology.[260] 
Vox said ""the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque"", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.[257] The foundation has been criticized for the relatively small amount of wealth donated.[261] In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.[256] In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion of Tesla's shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.[262] However, Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation's assets up to $9.4 billion at the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed $160 million to non-profits that year.[263] 
In August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vactrain—a vacuum tube train—and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.[264] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the hyperloop.[265] The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[266] The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6 billion.[267] The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[268] 
In 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project, with Hawthorne Municipal Airport as its destination.[269] In July 2017, Musk claimed that he had received ""verbal government approval"" to build a hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in both Philadelphia and Baltimore.[270] Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from the Boring Company website in 2021.[271] The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is cited to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers.[272] 
Biographer Ashlee Vance has noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would ""make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train"" proposal current in California at the time and consider more ""creative"" ideas.[273] 
In December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.[274] A particular focus of the company is to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against governments and corporations.[32] Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to OpenAI.[275] In 2023, Musk tweeted that he had ended up giving a total of $100 million to OpenAI. TechCrunch later reported that, according to its own investigation of public records, ""only $15 million"" of OpenAI's funding could be definitively traced to Musk. Musk subsequently stated that he had donated about $50 million.[276] 
In 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as the latter company increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[277] Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural networks such as GPT-3 (producing human-like text),[278] and DALL-E (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).[279] 
On July 12, 2023, Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company has reportedly hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.[280] The company, which is incorporated in Nevada, purchased 10,000 graphics processing units. Musk was reportedly obtaining funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla.[281] 
In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children trapped in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[282] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, urged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a back-up, in case flooding worsened.[283] Engineers at SpaceX and the Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[284][285] By this time, however, eight of the 12 children, had already been rescued, the rescuers employing full face masks, oxygen, and anesthesia; consequently, Thai authorities declined to use the submarine.[282] In March 2019, Musk was later one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the King of Thailand for involvement in the rescue effort.[286] 
Soon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, maintaining that Musk ""had no conception of what the cave passage was like"" and ""can stick his submarine where it hurts"". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a ""pedo guy"".[287] He deleted the tweets,[287] and apologized,[288] and he deleted his responses to critical tweets from Cher Scarlett, a software engineer, which had caused his followers to harass her.[289] In an email to BuzzFeed News, Musk later called Unsworth a ""child rapist"" and said that he had married a child.[290][291] 
In September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit in the District Court for the Central District of California.[292][293] In his defense, Musk argued that ""'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor"".[40] The defamation case began in December 2019, with Unsworth seeking $190 million in damages.[294] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet. On December 6, the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable.[295][296] 
In September 2018, Musk was interviewed on an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, during which he sampled a cigar laced with cannabis. [297] In 2022, Musk said that he and other Space-X employees had subsequently been required to undergo random drug tests for about a year following the incident, as required by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for Federal contractors.[298] In a 2019 60 Minutes interview, Musk had said, ""I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.""[299] 
In April 2019, Musk, through Emo G Records, released a rap track, ""RIP Harambe"", on SoundCloud.[300] The track, which refers to the killing of Harambe the gorilla and the subsequent Internet sensationalism surrounding the event, was performed by Yung Jake, written by Yung Jake and Caroline Polachek, and produced by BloodPop.[301] The following year, Musk released an EDM track, ""Don't Doubt Ur Vibe"", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[302] While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as ""indistinguishable... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on SoundCloud"",[303] TechCrunch said it was ""not a bad representation of the genre"".[302] 
In 2003, Musk said his favorite plane he owned was an L-39 Albatros.[304] He uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[305][306] His heavy use of the jet—it flew over 150,000 miles in 2018—and the consequent fossil fuel usage has received criticism.[305][307] 
His flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet. The Twitter version of the account was blocked in December 2022, after Musk claimed that his son X AE A-XII had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed.[308][309][310] This led to Musk banning the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O'Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept.[311] Musk equated the reporting to doxxing.[312] The police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker.[313] Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists' accounts should be reinstated, which resulted in reinstating the accounts.[314] 
Musk made $175.8 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in October 2002.[315] He was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.[316] 
At the start of 2020, Musk had a net worth of $27 billion.[317] By the end of the year his net worth had increased by $150 billion, mostly driven by his ownership of around 20% of Tesla stock.[318] During this period, Musk's net worth was often volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3 billion on September 8, the largest single-day plunge in Bloomberg Billionaires Index's history at the time.[319] In November of that year, Musk passed Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to become the third-richest person in the world; a week later he passed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to become the second-richest.[320] 
In January 2021, Musk, with a net worth of $185 billion, surpassed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to become the richest person in the world.[321] Bezos reclaimed the top spot the following month.[322] On September 27, 2021, after Tesla stock surged, Forbes announced that Musk had a net worth of over $200 billion, and was the richest person in the world.[323] In November 2021, Musk became the first person to have a net worth of more than $300 billion.[324] 
On December 30, 2022, it was reported that Musk had lost $200 billion from his net worth due to declining stock values in Tesla, becoming the first person in history to lose such a large sum of money.[325][326] In January 2023, Musk was recognized by Guinness World Records for experiencing the ""largest loss of personal fortune in history"" with regards to his financial losses since November 2021, which Guinness quoted a Forbes estimate of $182 billion.[327] 
Musk's personal wealth is managed by his family office called Excession LLC, formed in 2016 and run by Jared Birchall.[328][254] 
Around 75% of Musk's wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020,[320] a proportion that fell to about 37% as of December 2022,[f] after selling nearly $40 billion in company shares since late 2021.[329] Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed with the board in 2018 to a compensation plan that ties his personal earnings to Tesla's valuation and revenue.[318] The deal stipulated that Musk only received the compensation if Tesla reached certain market values.[330] It was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and a company board.[331] In the first award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to purchase 1.69 million Tesla shares (about 1% of the company) at below-market prices, which was worth about $800 million.[331][330] 
Musk paid $455 million in taxes on $1.52 billion of income between 2014 and 2018.[332] According to ProPublica, Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018.[333] He claimed his 2021 tax bill was estimated at $12 billion based on his sale of $14 billion worth of Tesla stock.[332] 
Musk has repeatedly described himself as ""cash poor"",[334][335] and has ""professed to have little interest in the material trappings of wealth"".[334] In May 2020, he pledged to sell almost all physical possessions.[335] Musk has defended his wealth by saying he is accumulating resources for humanity's outward expansion to space.[336]   Since joining Twitter (now known as X) in 2009,[337] Musk has been an active user and has over 100 million followers as of June 2022[update].[338] He posts memes, promotes business interests, and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues.[339] Musk's statements have provoked controversy, such as for mocking preferred gender pronouns[340][341] and comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler.[342] The New York Times describes his contributions to international relations as ""chaotic"", and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests.[343] As CEO of Twitter, Musk emerged as a source of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer Mauricio Garcia's apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a psyop.[344] Allegations of him being transphobic appeared as well in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance.[345][346] The Israel government and several media outlets accused Musk of antisemitism due to him spreading George Soros conspiracy theories,[347] although some Israeli officials defended Musk.[348] A tweet of his in November 2023 affirmed another antisemitic conspiracy theory.[349][350] 
Musk has been described as believing in longtermism, emphasizing the needs of future populations.[351] Accordingly, Musk has stated that artificial intelligence poses the greatest existential threat to humanity.[352][353] He has warned of a ""Terminator-like"" AI apocalypse and suggested that the government should regulate its safe development.[354][355] In 2015, Musk was a cosignatory, along with Stephen Hawking and hundreds of others, of the Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence, which called for the ban of autonomous weapons.[356] Musk's AI stances have been called alarmist and sensationalist by critics such as computer scientist Yann LeCun and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,[357][358] and led the think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation to award Musk its Annual Luddite Award in 2016.[359] 
Musk has described climate change as the greatest threat to humanity after AI,[360] and has advocated for a carbon tax.[361] Musk was a critic of President Donald Trump's stance on climate change,[362][363] and resigned from two presidential business advisory councils following Trump's 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.[364] 
Musk has long promoted the colonization of Mars and argues that humanity should become a ""multiplanetary species"".[365] He has suggested the use of nuclear weapons to terraform Mars.[366][367] He envisioned establishing a direct democracy on Mars, with a system in which more votes would be required to create laws than remove them.[368] Musk has also voiced concerns about human population decline,[369][370] saying that ""Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization.""[371] Speaking at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council session in 2021, Musk stated that a declining birth rate, and consequent population decline, is one of the biggest risks to human civilization.[372] 
While often described as libertarian, Musk has called himself ""politically moderate"" and was a registered independent voter when he lived in California. The New York Times wrote that Musk ""expresses views that don't fit neatly into [the American] binary, left-right political framework"".[373] Historically, Musk has donated to both Democrats and Republicans,[374] many of whom are in states in which he has a vested interest.[373] Beginning in the late 2010s, Musk's political contributions have shifted almost entirely to supporting Republicans.[375] 
Musk voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[376] In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for his proposed universal basic income.[377] He also endorsed Kanye West's 2020 presidential campaign.[378] He said he voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[379] In 2022, Musk said that he could ""no longer support"" the Democrats because they are the ""party of division & hate"",[380][381] and wrote a tweet encouraging ""independent-minded voters"" to vote Republican in the 2022 U.S. elections, which was an outlier among social media executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy.[382][383] He has supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, and Twitter hosted DeSantis's campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event.[384][385][386] In August 2023, Musk hosted Vivek Ramaswamy on Twitter Spaces, and shared his support.[387] As of May 2023, Musk was declining to endorse any specific candidate.[385] 
Musk opposes a ""billionaire's tax"",[388] and has argued on Twitter with more left-leaning Democratic politicians such as Bernie Sanders,[389][390] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,[391] and Elizabeth Warren.[392] He has raised questions about the Black Lives Matter protests, partially based on the fact that the phrase ""Hands up, don't shoot"" was made up.[393][394] Musk also promoted a baseless theory relating to the attack of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, but Musk deleted his tweet.[395] In May 2022, Musk traveled to Brazil to discuss projects to protect the Amazon rainforest with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.[396][397] 
Musk has praised China and has been described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government, allowing access to its markets for Tesla.[398] After Gigafactory Shanghai produced its first batch of vehicles, Musk thanked the Chinese government and Chinese people while criticizing the United States and its people.[399]: 207–208  In 2022, Musk wrote an article for China Cyberspace, the official publication of Cyberspace Administration of China, which enforces Internet censorship in China. His writing the article was described as conflicting with his advocacy for free speech.[400][401] Musk later advocated for Taiwan to become a ""special administrative zone"" of China which drew cross-party criticism from Taiwanese lawmakers.[402][403][404] In October 2022, Musk posted a Twitter poll and ""peace plan"" to resolve the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[405][406] It was reported that Musk allegedly spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin prior to the proposal, which Musk denied.[407][408][409] Musk has repeatedly expressed concern that a protracted war between Russia and Ukraine could lead to the use of nuclear weapons and the outbreak of World War III.[410][411][412] In October 2023, Musk said that ""We are sleepwalking our way into World War III with one foolish decision after the other.""[413] 
Musk was criticized for his public comments and conduct related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[414][415] He spread misinformation about the virus, including promoting a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine and claiming that COVID-19 death statistics were inflated.[416] 
In March 2020, Musk stated, ""The coronavirus panic is dumb.""[417][418] In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a ""specific form of the common cold"" and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% of the U.S. population.[414] On March 19, 2020, Musk predicted that there would be ""probably close to zero new cases in [the U.S.] by end of April"".[415] Politico labeled this statement one of ""the most audacious, confident, and spectacularly incorrect prognostications [of 2020]"".[419] Musk also claimed falsely that children ""are essentially immune"" to COVID-19.[420][421] 
Musk condemned COVID-19 lockdowns and initially refused to close the Tesla Fremont Factory in March 2020, defying the local shelter-in-place order.[414][422][423] In May 2020, he reopened the Tesla factory, defying the local stay-at-home order,[424][425] and warned workers that they would be unpaid, and their unemployment benefits might be jeopardized, if they did not report to work.[425] In December 2022, Musk called for prosecution of former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci.[426][427] 
In March 2020, Musk promised that Tesla would make ventilators for COVID-19 patients if there were a shortage.[428] After figures like New York City mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Musk's offer,[429] Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party.[428] However, Musk ended up buying and donating BiPAP and CPAP machines, which are devices that support respirations of someone able to breathe on their own, rather than the much more expensive and sought-after mechanical ventilator machines that are able to breathe for a patient entirely.[430][431] 
In September 2020, Musk stated that he would not get the COVID-19 vaccine, because he and his children were ""not at risk for COVID"".[432][433] Two months later, Musk contracted COVID-19 but suggested his COVID-19 rapid antigen test results were dubious, as he had been tested four times on the same device with the same nurse but had received equal numbers of positive and negative results.[434] Following this, a postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto explained in a Tweet why this result does not undermine the value of the test, referring to Musk as ""Space Karen,"" which then trended on Twitter.[434][435] In December 2021, Musk revealed that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine, saying that the science behind the COVID vaccines was ""unequivocal"" but expressing his opposition to COVID vaccine mandates.[436] 
Musk said that the U.S. government should not provide subsidies to companies, but impose a carbon tax to discourage poor behavior.[437][438] The free market, in his view, would achieve the best solution, and producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should have consequences.[439] Tesla has received billions of dollars in subsidies.[440] In addition, Tesla made large sums from government-initiated systems of zero-emissions credits offered in California and at the United States federal level, which facilitated initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles, as the tax credits given by governments enabled Tesla's battery electric vehicles to be price-competitive, in comparison with existing lower-priced internal combustion engine vehicles.[441] Notably, Tesla generates some of its revenue from its sales of carbon credits granted to the company, by both the European Union Emissions Trading System and the Chinese national carbon trading scheme.[442][443][444][445] 
Musk, a longtime opponent of short-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.[446][447] Wired magazine speculated that Musk's opposition to short-selling stems from how short sellers have an incentive to find and promote unfavorable information about his companies.[448] In early 2021, he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze.[449][450] 
In December 2022, Musk sold $3.6 billion of his stock in Tesla, equal to 22 million shares in the company,[451] despite pledging earlier in the year that he would not sell any additional shares.[452] 
Musk has promoted cryptocurrencies and supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies.[453] Given the influence of Musk's tweets in moving cryptocurrency markets,[454] his statements about cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulation by some, such as economist Nouriel Roubini.[455] Musk's social media praising of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was credited for increasing their prices. Consequently, Tesla's 2021 announcement, against the backdrop of Musk's social media behavior, that it bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, raised questions.[456] Tesla's announcement that it would accept Bitcoin for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors, due to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. A few months later, in response to the criticism, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin transactions until the environmental issues are solved.[457][458] 
Despite the Boring Company's involvement in building mass transit infrastructure, Musk has criticized public transport and promoted individualized transport (private vehicles).[459][460][461] His comments have been called ""elitist"" and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and urban planning experts, who have pointed out that public transportation in dense urban areas is more economical, more energy efficient, and requires much less space than private cars.[460][462][461] 
From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.[463] He then relocated to Texas, saying that California had become ""complacent"" about its economic success.[463][464] While hosting Saturday Night Live in 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome, although he has never been medically diagnosed.[465][466] Musk trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu while preparing for the proposed fight between himself and Mark Zuckerberg.[467] In his leisure time, he plays video games including Quake, Diablo IV, Elden Ring, Polytopia.[468][469] 
Musk has 10 surviving children.[470] He met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000.[471] In 2002, their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.[472] After his death, the couple used IVF to continue their family;[473] they had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006.[473] The couple divorced in 2008 and shared custody.[474][475] In 2022, one of the twins (his eldest) officially changed her name to reflect her gender identity as a trans woman and to use Wilson as her last name because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.[476] Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the Financial Times characterized as ""the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists.""[477] 
In 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley.[478] They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.[479][480] In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year.[481] After briefly filing for divorce in 2014,[481] Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016.[482] Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017;[483] he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.[484] 
In 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes revealed that they were dating.[485] Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.[486][487] According to Musk and Grimes, his name was ""X Æ A-12"" (/ɛks æʃ eɪ ˈtwɛlv/); however, the name would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,[488][489] and was then changed to ""X Æ A-Xii"". This drew more confusion, as Æ is not a letter in the modern English alphabet.[490] The child was eventually named X AE A-XII Musk, with ""X"" as a first name, ""AE A-XII"" as a middle name, and ""Musk"" as surname.[491] In December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk (nicknamed ""Y""), born via surrogacy.[2] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were ""semi-separated"" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single.[492][493] In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: ""I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid.""[2] Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again.[494] In September 2023 it was revealed that the pair had a third child, a son named Techno Mechanicus ""Tau"" Musk.[4] 
In July 2022, Insider published court documents revealing that Musk had had twins with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021.[495] They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December. The news ""raise[d] questions about workplace ethics"", given that Zilis directly reported to Musk.[496] Also in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year.[497] Musk denied the report.[498] 
Musk has also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha Bassett, who has been described as “an occasional girlfriend.”[499] 
In May 2022, Business Insider cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant, alleging that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct in 2016. The source stated that in November 2018, Musk, SpaceX, and the former flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims.[500] Musk responded, ""If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light"". He accused the article from Business Insider of being a ""politically motivated hit piece"".[501][502] After the release of the Business Insider article, Tesla's stock fell by more than 6%,[503] decreasing Musk's net worth by $10 billion.[504] Barron's wrote ""...some investors considered key-man risk – the danger that a company could be badly hurt by the loss of one individual.""[505] 
In April 2023, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit alleging that JPMorgan Chase profited from Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.[506] In May, a judge granted the U.S. Virgin Islands' request to serve Musk electronically through Tesla after the U.S. territory had difficulty locating him.[506] The efforts to subpoena Musk for documents do not implicate him in any wrongdoing and do not seek to have Musk testify under oath.[506] 
Musk's former girlfriend Grimes filed a parental relationship petition in late September 2023 as part of a custody dispute. The petition came a month after Grimes openly accused him in a social media post of blocking her access to the youngest of their three children.[507][508] 
Ben Brody, a 22-year-old Los Angeles-based college graduate, initiated a lawsuit in October 2023 against Musk for over $1 million. He alleged Musk had falsely identified him as a participant ""in a violent street brawl on behalf of a neo-Nazi extremist group"" near Portland, Oregon.[509][510][511] According to Brody's complaint, one of Musk's X posts promoted conspiracy theories that ""Ben Brody's alleged participation in the extremist brawl meant the incident was probably a 'false flag' operation to deceive the American public"".[509] The complaint also alleged that Musk's accusations led to Brody and his family being subjected to harassment and threats.[509][510] 
In October 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he was refusing to testify in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022.[512][513][514] According to the lawsuit, Musk testified twice in 2022 but refused to testify a third time in 2023, claiming the SEC was harassing him.[512][514] 
Though his ventures were influential within their own industries in the 2000s, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Vance described people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his ""part philosopher, part troll"" role on Twitter.[515] 
Musk was partly inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film Iron Man (2008).[516] Musk also had a cameo appearance in the film's 2010 sequel, Iron Man 2.[517] Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as Machete Kills (2013),[518] Why Him? (2016),[519] and Men in Black: International (2019).[520] Television series in which he has appeared include The Simpsons (""The Musk Who Fell to Earth"", 2015),[521] The Big Bang Theory (""The Platonic Permutation"", 2015),[522] South Park (""Members Only"", 2016),[523][524] Young Sheldon (""A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac®"", 2017),[525] Rick and Morty (""One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty"", 2019),[526][527] and Saturday Night Live (2021).[528] He contributed interviews to the documentaries Racing Extinction (2015) and the Werner Herzog-directed Lo and Behold (2016).[529][530] 
Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[531] In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University[532] and IEEE Honorary Membership.[533] Awards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low Transportation Award in 2008,[534] the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale Gold Space Medal in 2010,[535] and the Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal in 2012.[536] Time has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world on four occasions in 2010,[537] 2013,[538] 2018,[539] and 2021.[540] Musk was selected as Time's ""Person of the Year"" for 2021. Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote that ""Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too"".[541][542] In February 2022, Musk was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.[543]

The facility had a worker-injury rate six times the space-industry average in 2022. REUTERS/Go Nakamura Reuters documented at least 600 previously unreported workplace injuries at Musk’s rocket company: crushed limbs, amputations, electrocutions, head and eye wounds and one death. SpaceX employees say they’re paying the price for the billionaire’s push to colonize space at breakneck speed. By MARISA TAYLOR Filed Nov. 10, 2023, 11 a.m. GMT One windy night at Elon Musk’s SpaceX facility in McGregor, Texas, Lonnie LeBlanc and his co-workers realized they had a problem. They needed to transport foam insulation to the rocket company’s main hangar but had no straps to secure the cargo. LeBlanc, a relatively new employee, offered a solution to hold down the load: He sat on it. After the truck drove away, a gust blew LeBlanc and the insulation off the trailer, slamming him headfirst into the pavement. LeBlanc, 38, had retired nine months earlier from the U.S. Marine Corps. He was pronounced dead from head trauma at the scene. Federal inspectors with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) later determined that SpaceX had failed to protect LeBlanc from a clear hazard, noting the gravity and severity of the violation. LeBlanc’s co-workers told OSHA that SpaceX had no convenient access to tie-downs and no process or oversight for handling such loads. SpaceX acknowledged the problems, and the agency instructed the company to make seven specific safety improvements, including more training and equipment, according to the inspection report. It was hardly the last serious accident at SpaceX. Since LeBlanc’s death in June 2014, which hasn’t been previously reported, Musk’s rocket company has disregarded worker-safety regulations and standard practices at its inherently dangerous rocket and satellite facilities nationwide, with workers paying a heavy price, a Reuters investigation found. Through interviews and government records, the news organization documented at least 600 injuries of SpaceX workers since 2014. Many were serious or disabling. The records included reports of more than 100 workers suffering cuts or lacerations, 29 with broken bones or dislocations, 17 whose hands or fingers were “crushed,” and nine with head injuries, including one skull fracture, four concussions and one traumatic brain injury. The cases also included five burns, five electrocutions, eight accidents that led to amputations, 12 injuries involving multiple unspecified body parts, and seven workers with eye injuries. Others were relatively minor, including more than 170 reports of strains or sprains. Current and former employees said such injuries reflect a chaotic workplace where often under-trained and overtired staff routinely skipped basic safety procedures as they raced to meet Musk’s aggressive deadlines for space missions. SpaceX, founded by Musk more than two decades ago, takes the stance that workers are responsible for protecting themselves, according to more than a dozen current and former employees, including a former senior executive. Musk himself at times appeared cavalier about safety on visits to SpaceX sites: Four employees said he sometimes played with a novelty flamethrower and discouraged workers from wearing safety yellow because he dislikes bright colors. The lax safety culture, more than a dozen current and former employees said, stems in part from Musk’s disdain for perceived bureaucracy and a belief inside SpaceX that it’s leading an urgent quest to create a refuge in space from a dying Earth. “Elon’s concept that SpaceX is on this mission to go to Mars as fast as possible and save humanity permeates every part of the company,” said Tom Moline, a former SpaceX senior avionics engineer who was among a group of employees fired after raising workplace complaints. “The company justifies casting aside anything that could stand in the way of accomplishing that goal, including worker safety.” One severe injury in January 2022 resulted from a series of safety failures that illustrate systemic problems at SpaceX, according to eight former SpaceX employees familiar with the accident. In that case, a part flew off during pressure testing of a Raptor V2 rocket engine – fracturing the skull of employee Francisco Cabada and putting him in a coma. The sources told Reuters that senior managers at the Hawthorne, California site were repeatedly warned about the dangers of rushing the engine’s development, along with inadequate training of staff and testing of components. The part that failed and struck the worker had a flaw that was discovered, but not fixed, before the testing, two of the employees said. Cabada’s wife told Reuters the company has ignored the family’s attempts to find out why he wasn’t protected. “It would have been nice to get a call from Elon Musk,” Ydy Cabada said. “But I guess workers are just disposable to them.” In all, Reuters interviewed more than three dozen people with knowledge of SpaceX safety practices, including more than two dozen current or former employees. Many of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity, citing concerns about career or legal repercussions. SpaceX did not respond to questions from Reuters and a detailed description of this article’s findings. The more than 600 SpaceX injuries Reuters documented represent only a portion of the total case count, a figure that is not publicly available. OSHA has required companies to report their total number of injuries annually since 2016, but SpaceX facilities failed to submit reports for most of those years. About two-thirds of the injuries Reuters uncovered came in years when SpaceX did not report that annual data, which OSHA collects to help prioritize on-site inspections of potentially dangerous workplaces. “Elon’s concept that SpaceX is on this mission to go to Mars as fast as possible and save humanity permeates every part of the company. The company justifies casting aside anything that could stand in the way of accomplishing that goal, including worker safety.” Reuters unearthed details about the 600-plus injuries by examining court documents in worker lawsuits, employee medical records, state workers’ compensation claims and emergency-call records. The news agency also obtained, through public records requests, internal SpaceX injury logs that the company turned over to federal and state safety inspectors following serious safety incidents. Such logs are rarely made public. Regulators require companies to keep the records, which include descriptions of individual injuries, and to produce them upon request. After years of failing to report annual injury-and-illness statistics to regulators, some SpaceX sites started filing the data in 2021 or 2022. The data for 2022, which are more complete, reveal injury rates at three major SpaceX industrial facilities that far exceeded the space-industry average. SpaceX injury data reporting failures SpaceX facilities failed to submit injury data annually, as required by regulators, for most years since 2016. When they did report, three major sites’ injury rates far exceeded industry averages. The average was 0.8 injuries per 100 workers for 2022 and has been relatively stable for many years. The 2022 injury rate at the company’s manufacturing-and-launch facility near Brownsville, Texas, was 4.8 injuries or illnesses per 100 workers – six times higher than the space-industry average of 0.8. Its rocket-testing facility in McGregor, Texas, where LeBlanc died, had a rate of 2.7, more than three times the average. The rate at its Hawthorne, California, manufacturing facility was more than double the average at 1.8 injuries per 100 workers. The company’s facility in Redmond, Washington, had a rate of 0.8, the same as the industry average. Two other SpaceX facilities in Florida, at Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral, could not be compared to the industry average in 2022. Kennedy didn’t report injury data that year. And the company labeled Cape Canaveral as part of a different industry subcategory for which the government doesn’t calculate an average rate. The Kennedy site did report injury data for 2016, the first year it was required to do so – but hasn’t reported since. For that year, the facility reported data amounting to an injury rate of 21.5 injuries per 100 workers, about 27 times the industry average. The facility employed only 50 people at the time; it had just taken over a launch pad from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Sixteen of those workers were injured, SpaceX reported. By 2021, employment at Kennedy had grown to more than 1,100 workers, NASA said. (See related story on how Reuters analyzed SpaceX’s safety record.) A dozen worker-safety experts said SpaceX’s poor safety record underscores the perils of working in the lightly regulated and fast-expanding U.S. space industry. Other major space companies have also failed to report annual injury data to OSHA in some recent years. Reuters reviewed state and federal safety violation records on SpaceX and found no sanctions for its data-reporting failures. For safety violations that inspectors found after SpaceX worker accidents, state and federal regulators levied only small fines, typically ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. In a written response to questions from Reuters, OSHA did not comment on SpaceX’s worker safety record or its enforcement decisions involving the company. The agency did not address why it never cited SpaceX for failing to report injury data for many years, saying it would be “unfair to draw a conclusion” because it didn’t know “the specifics.” Reuters documented the safety reporting lapses using the agency’s own records. The agency did say it has recently increased inspections of companies generally and issued more of its stiffest penalties in egregious cases. California OSHA, a state-run workplace safety regulator, did not comment in response to Reuters’ questions. Current and former employees said SpaceX’s high injury rates reflect a chaotic workplace where often under-trained and overtired staff routinely skipped basic safety procedures as they raced to meet Musk’s aggressive deadlines for space missions. NASA said it has paid SpaceX $11.8 billion to date as a private space contractor. The agency did not comment on the company’s safety record but said it has the option of enforcing contract provisions that require SpaceX to “have a robust and effective safety program and culture.” SpaceX has defended its safety practices in written responses to OSHA and CalOSHA. In response to an inquiry into the Cabada accident, SpaceX argued to CalOSHA that it shouldn’t be held responsible for such injuries because it provides extensive safety training and the malfunction was not reasonably foreseeable. Accountability for such part failures and any resulting injuries falls instead on a cadre of employees known as “responsible engineers,” or REs, the company wrote. “REs are ultimately responsible for all aspects of their components and systems,” including safety, the company wrote. “Put simply, the RE is the delegated SpaceX representative.” Safety specialists dismissed SpaceX’s contention that it can off-load the company’s duty to ensure worker safety to specific engineers it employs. Jordan Barab, who served as an OSHA deputy assistant secretary between 2009 and 2017, called the notion “ludicrous.” OSHA told Reuters that employers, not designated employees, are responsible for ensuring a hazard-free workplace. Travis Carson, a former Brownsville welder and production supervisor, said SpaceX generally left staffers in charge of their own safety, with little training or oversight. “SpaceX’s idea of safety is: ‘We’ll let you decide what’s safe for you,’ which really means there was no accountability,” said Carson, who has worked for more than two decades in dangerous jobs such as building submarines. “That’s a terrible approach to take in industrial environments.” ‘No accountability’ Since Musk co-founded SpaceX in 2002, his free-wheeling entrepreneurism has proved a powerful draw for young skilled workers. Some SpaceX employees described eagerly joining the company as it outpaced competitors and offered perks including in-house medical clinics and private company stock that has shot up in value. The company, which employs 13,000 workers, had an estimated value of $150 billion as of earlier this year. Musk has a 42% stake and 79% of the company’s voting power, according to a company filing. SpaceX has achieved major breakthroughs. It was the first private company to send humans into orbit. Its Starlink unit is now the world’s largest satellite operator. Competitors including Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin have struggled to keep pace with SpaceX’s reusable rockets, which have slashed launch costs. Some SpaceX engineers say they relish collaborating with creative coworkers in an environment with little bureaucracy. “There’s a certain amount of red tape that SpaceX avoids, which allows it to move faster” than NASA or private competitors, said Chris Cunnington, a former engineer in McGregor, Texas. He said he believed SpaceX struck a good balance between speed and safety. Other current and former employees at the company’s Brownsville site, which had the highest 2022 injury rate, said the company’s disdain for structured processes came at a high cost to workers. SpaceX started building its Brownsville site in 2014, and it has since become the epicenter of Musk’s Mars mission. The facility employs more than 1,600 workers on the Texas-Mexico border and combines manufacturing, testing and launching. It’s the base of SpaceX’s Starship program, a project aiming to build cheaper rockets faster. Brownsville managers, many of them in their 20s, worked grueling hours trying to meet Musk’s deadlines, according to six current or former employees familiar with the site’s operations, including Moline and Carson. Some workers slept overnight at the facility at times so they could work more than 80 hours a week, according to four of those employees. Carson worked at the Brownsville site as a welder in 2019 and 2020 and returned as a production supervisor in 2021 and 2022. He said some employees took Adderall, the stimulant typically used to treat attention-deficit disorder, without a prescription. Others fell asleep in bathrooms, said Carson and three other current or former Brownsville workers. To speed work and cut costs, SpaceX started manufacturing rockets in tents next to an undeveloped Gulf of Mexico beach. Workers welded rocket parts up to 12 hours a day, six days a week, often in temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the SpaceX workers said. When overcome by heat, they were given IV fluids and sent back to work. When high winds disrupted the work, supervisors shut the tents, closing off ventilation that is essential for safe welding, according to the six current and former workers. OSHA warns that welding stainless steel can generate a highly toxic, cancer-causing dust. The agency told Reuters it requires companies to assess the danger of such environments through air sampling and to implement a “respiratory protection program” when needed. One former welder, Phillip Fruge, said he asked managers for respirators commonly used to protect welders’ lungs, but they weren’t provided. “We could see the clouds of the dust filling the tent,” Fruge recalled. “Everyone was just breathing it in, day after day.” Carson said he pressed superiors for better safety measures but was ignored. He recalled stepping into the interior of a rocket under construction in 2021 on his first day as a supervisor. Another manager, working 20 feet above him, carelessly dropped a nearly 100-pound hoist, barely missing Carson. “That’s like a firing offense at other places, but not at SpaceX,” Carson said. “They needed bodies, and Elon needed stuff done.” Carson himself eventually was fired in January 2022 after getting into a scuffle with a boss. Carson, who is African American, said he shoved the manager, a younger man, because he had repeatedly called Carson “boy,” despite Carson’s requests that he stop. “Boy” is widely considered a racial epithet by Americans when used to refer to a Black man. The supervisor, who could not be reached for comment, was not disciplined, according to Carson. Reuters could not independently confirm how SpaceX handled the incident. SpaceX sometimes rushed to hire workers and regularly failed to properly train or equip new recruits, more than a dozen current and former employees said. Workers with no experience, for instance, were handed welding tools without training, they said. Four of these employees, who were managers fresh out of college, described making tough calls on the safety of dangerous activities with little guidance. In November 2021, two Brownsville technicians were moving square steel tubing weighing 500 pounds, using a crane with a lifting magnet, according to OSHA inspection records. The tubing fell and crushed a worker’s hand because the crane was only designed to hoist 300 pounds, OSHA concluded. The employee, whose name was redacted in the inspection report the agency gave Reuters, required long-term treatment after surgery, including the partial amputation of the worker’s ring finger, according to the report. The agency faulted the company for failing to ensure employees tested whether the crane could lift the load. SpaceX appealed the resulting $43,506 fine and got it knocked down to $8,701 after agreeing to remedy the worker-safety problems identified in the report. Florentino Rios suffered a severe eye injury at SpaceX’s Brownsville site one summer night in 2021, as he worked about 25 feet off the ground attaching two beams to a launch pad. A crane operator missed a hand signal from Rios and mistakenly tried to move the beams after they were fixed in place, Rios said in an interview. That error caused a chain connecting the crane to the beams to snap and strike Rios in the face. Another worker who was present confirmed Rios’ account. The team should have had walkie-talkies, Rios said, and had previously asked management for better lighting. As blood trickled down his face, Rios inched along a beam to a platform where he was lowered down, he said. SpaceX employees who examined him at an on-site medical clinic told him he could return to work on the next shift, although he still couldn’t see well, said his attorney, Richard Hinojosa. Reuters could not independently confirm the SpaceX medical clinic’s assessment. Rios went to the hospital that night. A medical scan revealed a traumatic injury in his swollen left eye, according to medical and workers’ compensation records reviewed by Reuters. He continued to work anyway for a few days. When he sought further treatment, doctors told him he had lost vision in the eye and was legally blind, the records show. Rios, 55, said he can no longer drive or work construction. He sued SpaceX alleging its negligence caused the injury by failing to implement or follow worker-safety procedures. “It wasn’t safe,” Rios said, adding that management never addressed the problems. The company, in court records, argued that Rios’ own negligence was to blame. The case is ongoing. “I used to be someone who didn’t like sitting around,” said Rios. “I worked day and night to give my children what they needed. And now, I can’t.” Shortcutting safety On Jan. 18 of last year, part of a Raptor V2 engine broke away during pressure testing at the SpaceX facility in Hawthorne, California. The part, a fuel-controller assembly cover, careened into the head of Cabada, a SpaceX technician. Nearly two years later, the father of three young children remains in a coma with a hole in his skull, family members said. The accident generated news last year but little has emerged until now about the causes. The incident stemmed from several safety lapses at the Hawthorne site, according to Reuters interviews with eight former SpaceX employees familiar with the incident and the testing preparations. Two of the employees said the mishap resulted in part from a simple mistake: An engineer started the test when Cabada was still too close to the engine and unprotected from explosions or flying debris. Senior managers were repeatedly warned for at least a year before the accident that pressure-testing crews were not following standard worker-safety protocols, such as providing protective barriers or clearing personnel from the testing area, according to a former employee familiar with the matter. Such testing should be conducted with a “boom box” covering the whole engine to protect workers, the employee said. At one point, managers rejected a new training program, written and proposed by pressure-testing staff, on the grounds that it would cause delays, according to the source and a document reviewed by Reuters. Another key contributing factor: SpaceX senior managers, in the months leading up to the accident, had instructed engineers to end or limit the testing of individual rocket parts before they are assembled into an engine, two staffers said. The managers were reacting to Musk’s demands for faster progress on the Raptor engine program, the workers said. The team normally would have conducted more extensive testing on the cover that malfunctioned and struck Cabada, they said. The limited testing nonetheless revealed a potentially dangerous flaw in the cover, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The component was redesigned to correct the problem, they said, but the new part wasn’t ready before the pressure testing that hurt Cabada. Reuters could not determine the precise nature of the flaw. SpaceX’s rejection of a more rigorous training program, its moves to limit testing, and the discovery of the cover’s defect before the accident haven’t been previously reported. Related content Tesla created secret team to suppress thousands of driving range complaints Tesla workers shared sensitive images recorded by customer cars Musk’s Neuralink faces federal probe, employee backlash over animal tests In a written response to CalOSHA’s inspection, SpaceX said it had conducted ample analysis and testing of the part before it failed. More than a dozen current and former workers said SpaceX’s willingness to cut corners and skip some worker safeguards has helped keep it well ahead of competitors and score lucrative government contracts. SpaceX last year surpassed Boeing to become NASA’s second-largest vendor. The company also boosts development speed through a structure that gives managers high levels of autonomy but raises safety risks, the dozen current and former SpaceX workers said. The company is split into three teams: engineering, manufacturing, and testing. The engineering leadership includes the “responsible engineers” SpaceX designates as accountable for safety in manufacturing. But those engineers have little control of other teams, including the one that stress-tests the engines and parts they develop, according to two staffers with knowledge of the matter. In the case of the test that injured Cabada, this loose structure meant the testing team never coordinated with the responsible engineer team, the workers said. After the Cabada accident, CalOSHA inspectors detailed other safety lapses. One employee involved in the pressure checks told them that the company generally didn’t do full safety inspections before such testing, agency records show. Another said the engine should have undergone more testing “without personnel around,” according to the records. SpaceX pushed back on the agency’s finding that the company failed to protect Cabada, the records show. The company blamed a particular responsible engineer, who it said was accountable for the safety of the defective cover “through the lifecycle of development, testing and production.” SpaceX fired the engineer and a manager on the same team over the incident, according to three employees with knowledge of the situation. Cabada’s wife, Ydy, said SpaceX hasn’t responded to the family’s attempts to find out how he was injured. Michael Sanchez, a Los Angeles attorney representing her, said the company has never answered his inquiries, including a March 2022 certified letter requesting a copy of any surveillance footage of the accident and advising SpaceX to preserve any other relevant records. Ydy Cabada has considered a lawsuit but has not filed one. “SpaceX has not returned a single call,” Sanchez said. Francisco’s sister, Evelyn Cabada, said the accident devastated the family. In addition to the severe head injury, she said, her brother caught pneumonia and meningitis in the hospital. Ydy Cabada said the family still holds out hope he’ll emerge from the coma. “The doctors keep saying nothing has changed,” she said. “It’ll take a miracle for him to get out of that bed.” Flamethrowers and safety yellow Musk is well-known as a hands-on manager. He was directly involved in handing down sometimes unrealistic deadlines, said current and former employees. Musk’s heavy involvement in scheduling resulted in “significantly more unsafe working conditions than would have existed otherwise,” said Moline, the engineer. One former SpaceX executive defended Musk, saying he would listen to employees who were willing to go “toe-to-toe” with him on safety issues and took them seriously. Another former executive said Musk cared about his workers and was bothered when they got hurt, but that safety was not one of Musk’s priorities. Musk, the ex-manager said, thought that “workers take care of their safety themselves.” This former executive said that top company officials knew its injury rates ran high but attributed the problem to employing a largely young workforce in a dangerous industry. SpaceX leaders also believed the company shouldn’t be held to the same standard as competitors because SpaceX oversees more missions and manufacturing, the two former executives said. That attitude is a red flag that a company is rationalizing a fundamentally unsafe environment, according to four worker-safety experts interviewed by Reuters, including Barab, the former OSHA deputy assistant secretary. “SpaceX shouldn’t be exempt from protecting workers from being injured or killed,” Barab said, “just because they’re doing innovative work.” Four SpaceX employees told Reuters they were disturbed by Musk’s habit of playing with a flamethrower when he visited the SpaceX site in Hawthorne. The device was marketed to the public in 2018 as a $500 novelty item by Musk’s tunnel-building firm, the Boring Company. Videos posted online show it can shoot a thick flame more than five feet long. Boring later renamed the device the “Not-A-Flamethrower” amid reports of confiscations by authorities. For years, Musk and his deputies found it “hilarious” to wave the flamethrower around, firing it near other people and giggling “like they were in middle school,” one engineer said. Musk tweeted in 2018 that the flamethrower was “guaranteed to liven up any party!” At SpaceX, Musk played with the device in close-quarters office settings, said the engineer, who at one point feared Musk would set someone’s hair on fire. Musk also became known in California and Texas for ordering machinery that was painted in industrial safety yellow to be repainted black or blue because of his aversion to bright colors, according to three former SpaceX supervisors. Managers also sometimes told workers to avoid wearing safety-yellow vests around Musk, or to replace yellow safety tape with red, the supervisors said. Workers often walked too close to engine-testing and rocket-building facilities because the company failed to cordon off areas or put up warning signs, said Paige Holland-Thielen, a former operations and automation engineer in Hawthorne. “One time I walked out the door of my building, and there was a giant crane there,” she recalled. “A bunch of people in hard hats started screaming at me to get back inside.” Holland-Thielen and Moline, who also worked in Hawthorne, were among nine workers fired in the summer of 2022 after raising workplace complaints in an open letter that was ultimately signed by hundreds of employees. The letter criticized Musk’s flippant social-media responses to sexual-harassment allegations against him, which he denied. It also criticized a management culture of dismissing employee concerns and unevenly enforcing discipline policies. Eight workers who drafted the letter have since filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board against SpaceX alleging unfair labor practices. Moline said SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell told him he was being fired for distracting workers from getting to Mars. “Please focus on your job and the mission of SpaceX – to get humanity to Mars as quickly as possible,” Shotwell told him and Holland-Thielen, among others, in an email reviewed by Reuters. Shotwell did not respond to a request for comment. A death and a $7,000 fine SpaceX has faced few consequences from safety regulators for its failure to report annual safety data and to protect workers in incidents reviewed by federal and state inspectors, agency records show. OSHA and CalOSHA have fined the billionaire’s rocket company a total of $50,836 for violations stemming from one worker’s death and seven serious safety incidents, regulatory records show. OSHA did not comment on the modest penalties that resulted from inspections of SpaceX. SpaceX’s history of injuries and regulatory run-ins in California underscores the limits of worker-safety regulation. Fines are capped by law and pose little deterrent for major companies, experts in U.S. worker safety regulation said. Federal and state regulators also suffer from chronic understaffing of inspectors, they said. OSHA did not address questions about staffing levels but said it “focuses its resources on hazardous workplaces.” CalOSHA levied a fine of $18,475 for the violation that resulted in Cabada’s skull fracture. SpaceX unsuccessfully disputed the agency’s classification of the violation as “serious” and appealed the penalty as excessive, asking for a reduction to $475. In another case, CalOSHA never inspected the company following a serious accident resulting in a leg amputation. But the agency may not have known the accident happened at all: A Reuters review of agency documents indicated it had no record of the 2016 incident. Federal and state law require companies to immediately report all employee deaths, amputations and injuries resulting in hospital admissions. It isn’t clear whether SpaceX ever reported the injury. Neither the company nor CalOSHA commented on why the agency had no report on it. If SpaceX didn’t report the case, “I don’t think they have any excuse,” said Ann Rosenthal, a former OSHA associate solicitor, who handled legal matters for the agency until 2018. The incident resulted in Steven Trollinger’s leg being crushed during a mission to recover a rocket that landed in the Pacific Ocean, according to records in a lawsuit Trollinger filed. The accident occurred when he and other SpaceX employees were being transferred between two vessels. SpaceX knew that one of the vessels wasn’t properly equipped with a transfer platform designed to ensure the workers’ safety, but proceeded anyway, Trollinger’s lawsuit alleges. Trollinger, who declined to comment, settled with SpaceX for an undisclosed sum, court records show. In inspections following two other serious California injuries – the amputation of two fingers in 2017 and a serious knee injury in 2021 – CalOSHA levied fines of $750 and $5,060, respectively. When a worker’s finger was amputated this March, inspectors took no action and did not visit the site, records show. After Texas worker Lonnie LeBlanc fell off a trailer and died in 2014, OSHA came to what it called an informal settlement with the company after inspectors found the safety lapses, OSHA records show. The settlement allowed SpaceX to pay a $7,000 fine. LeBlanc’s brother, Chris Weimer, and an uncle, Ron Weimer, said the family didn’t know that OSHA had investigated the death and found violations until Reuters told them. Ron Weimer said the hazardous nature of rocket-building is no excuse for his nephew’s death. “There’s a way to do dangerous work,” he said, “without people dying.” Safety at SpaceX: How Reuters analyzed workplace injuries Reuters documented at least 600 injuries at SpaceX through a variety of public records, including the company’s own injury logs at three facilities that were inspected by regulators. Such logs are normally kept private by companies, but they became public record when SpaceX was required to turn them over to inspectors from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and a state-run affiliate in California, CalOSHA. Reuters obtained these logs, which include short descriptions of each injury in a given year, through public records requests. They covered between one and five years at each of the three facilities, in Hawthorne, California; Cape Canaveral, Florida; and Redmond, Washington. Reuters also documented injuries through other public records and employee interviews at those three sites and three other facilities, in Brownsville, Texas; McGregor, Texas; and at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The records included court documents in worker lawsuits, employee medical records, state workers’ compensation claims, and emergency calls. SpaceX sites examined by Reuters The six total sites were chosen because they are SpaceX’s biggest industrial facilities, engaged in manufacturing, testing or rocket launching. Reuters also calculated annual injury rates for 2022 for some of these facilities using the annual data they have been required to file with OSHA since 2016. Reuters calculated the facilities’ rates using an OSHA formula that uses the total hours worked at a company to estimate an annual injury rate per 100 full-time workers. The data used to calculate the SpaceX rates also included a small number of illnesses. Before 2021 and 2022, SpaceX facilities usually did not submit the required data, with each site failing to report it for between four and six years. When comparing these rates to the space-industry average, the news organization used an estimated average injury-and-illness rate produced annually by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS derives industry averages by collecting a representative sample of data from companies in a given industry; it cannot by law release data from individual firms surveyed. Like OSHA, the BLS is a division of the U.S. Labor Department, and both agencies collect injury data from companies under the same guidelines. OSHA advises companies to use the BLS average in their industry as a benchmark for their worker-safety performance. SpaceX, when filing injury data to the OSHA, classifies itself as part of the “guided missile and space vehicle manufacturing” industry, a regulatory data-collection category that is a subset of the larger aerospace industry. The BLS estimated the average injury-and-illness rate for that industry was 0.8 per 100 workers in 2022, a rate that has not changed much in recent years. For one facility, in Cape Canaveral, SpaceX listed a different aerospace industry subcategory for 2022: “transportation by spacecraft, freight.” That facility couldn’t be compared to an industry average because the BLS doesn’t produce one for that subcategory. Another facility, at Kennedy Space Center, did not report annual injury data to OSHA for 2022. reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives Got a confidential news tip?

Walter Isaacson’s authorized biography of the controversial tech mogul, which was published in September, will serve as the basis for the screenplay. Isaacson’s “Steve Jobs” book was previously adapted into the 2015 Universal film of the same name, starring Michael Fassbender as the Apple CEO.  
	Sources tell Variety that there was heated competition to option Isaacson’s book from studios and filmmakers alike, with A24 ultimately winning the bidding war. Aronofsky, who most recently directed last year’s Oscar contender “The Whale” starring Brendan Fraser, is known for his surreal filmmaking style, which often includes psychological elements. His past credits include “Requiem for a Dream” (2000), “Black Swan” (2010) and “Mother!” (2017). For his work on “Black Swan,” Aronofsky was nominated for the best director Oscar, while Portman ended up winning the best actress award. 	        	Musk first rose to prominence when he founded SpaceX, a spacecraft manufacturing company, in 2002. He was also an early investor in Tesla, and eventually climbed the ranks to become the automotive giant’s chairman (a position he stepped down from in 2018 after he was sued by the SEC), product architect and CEO. Most recently, Musk made the controversial decision to purchase Twitter for $44 billion, rebranding it to X. Since taking over the social media platform, Musk has made several changes that have resulted in backlash, including laying off a large number of the company’s employees, charging users for verification and removing headlines from links shared on the site. He is currently the wealthiest person in the world, with Bloomberg and Forbes estimating his net worth to be more than $200 billion as of October.  
	Musk addressed the news on X later on Friday, writing in response to a post by X News Daily: “Glad Darren is doing it. He is one of the best.”

Killing the ...","Anyone who runs a company needs a way to de-stress. For some CEOs that might mean golf or sailing. For Elon Musk, who runs or owns Tesla, SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter), the main method is playing video games. “It calms my mind. Killing the demons in a video game calms the demons in my mind,” Musk told podcaster Lex Fridman in an episode released Friday. He added later, “I’ve played a lot of video games because it’s my primary recreational activity.” The world’s richest man also said, “My mind is a storm. I don’t think most people would want to be me. They may think they would want to be me, but they don’t, they don’t know, they don’t understand.”  Musk’s longtime companion Grimes, with whom he has three children, told biographer Walter Isaacson that Musk has no “hobbies or ways to relax other than video games, but he takes those so seriously that it gets very intense.”  Among his favorite titles is The Battle of Polytopia, billed as a “strategy game about building a civilization and going into battle.” Players compete to control resources and develop technologies, and they wage battles in order to build an empire. Musk’s brother Kimbal told Isaacson that his famous sibling said Polytopia “would teach me to be a CEO like he was.” The game was also fodder for a series of life and business lessons for Elon, with the first one being, “Empathy is not an asset.” Another favorite of Musk’s is Elden Ring, centered on war and empire-building, which he told Fridman was a “candidate for the best game ever, top five for sure.” He added that it’s “incredibly creative” with “stunning” art.  “Beating hatred in the internal realm,” he added, “is the hardest boss battle in life and in the video game.”  Musk’s game-playing has also preceded some key business decisions. He pulled the trigger on buying Twitter right after playing Elden Ring until five in the morning, Grimes told Isaacson.  Mostly, Musk seems to use video games to get into a certain zone.  “If you play a tough video game, you can get into a state of flow which is very enjoyable. Admittedly it needs to be not too easy, not too hard—kind of in the Goldilocks zone,” he told Fridman. “I guess you generally want to feel like you’re progressing in the game. And there’s also beautiful art, engaging storylines, and it’s like an amazing puzzle to solve.” © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News          Brace yourselves. Jokes incoming. Elon Musk has announced the introduction of “Grok,” an artificially intelligent chatbot, for some users of X, which the billionaire suggests has a sarcastic sense of humor similar to his own.
   
      Musk, who has owned X — formerly known as Twitter — for a year, announced late Saturday that Grok is being trained by having “real-time access” to information from the platform.
   
      Musk’s AI startup, xAI, which developed the bot, said in a blogpost that it took inspiration from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, a comedy sci-fi novel by British author Douglas Adams.
   
      Grok “loves sarcasm,” Musk posted on X. “I have no idea who could have guided it this way.”
   
      “Grok is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use it if you hate humor!” xAI said in its blogpost.
   
      The bot is still in an early stage of testing, Musk said﻿, but will soon be made available to subscribers of X’s Premium+ service, who, in the United States, pay $16 a month for features such as the once-coveted blue checkmark.        Grok is intended to rival ChatGPT, an AI chatbot released to the public by its maker OpenAI last November to much fanfare. Musk is a co-founder of OpenAI, but stepped down as chairman five years ago partly over disagreements about the co﻿mpany’s direction.
   
Elon Musk sees an AI future where ‘no job is needed’        In its blogpost, xAI said the large language model (LLM) — the type of system used to train AI applications — underpinning Grok-1 had outstripped the capabilities of GPT-3.5, the LLM that trains the publicly available version of ChatGPT, on several measures, including solving some high school math problems.
   
      “It is only surpassed by models that were trained with a significantly larger amount of training data and compute resources like GPT-4,” the company said.
   
      Musk has previously expressed concerns about the speed of development of AI, and the technology’s potential to fundamentally change human society for the worse.
   
      xAI said it expects Grok to rapidly improve as X’s users feed it with more information, which may fuel unease among those critical of Musk’s handling of the platform since he bought the company last October.
   
      The world’s richest person has called himself a “free speech absolutist” and said that, under his leadership, the company would be “very reluctant” to delete content and permanently ban some users.
   
      British far-right figure Tommy Robinson, who has a history of posting Islamophobic content on X, thanked Musk Sunday for reinstating his account, five years after being banned.

Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Mr Musk showed his talents for entrepreneurship early, going door-to-door with his brother selling homemade ...","It seems like not a day goes by without billionaire Elon Musk making headlines. The boss of X (formerly Twitter), Tesla and SpaceX is the world's richest person and uses his platform to make his views known on a vast array of topics. He is currently in the UK for a global summit on artificial intelligence. Ahead of the event he said he thought AI could lead to humanity's extinction - without giving any detail on how he believed that could actually happen. Since bursting on to the Silicon Valley scene more than two decades ago, the 52-year-old serial entrepreneur has kept the public captivated with his business antics. Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Mr Musk showed his talents for entrepreneurship early, going door-to-door with his brother selling homemade chocolate Easter eggs and developing his first computer game at the age of 12.  He has described his childhood as difficult, affected by his parents' divorce, bullying at school and his own difficulty picking up on social cues because of Asperger's Syndrome. At the earliest opportunity, he left home for college, moving to Canada and then the US, where he studied economics and physics at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League college.  In a 2010 essay for Marie Claire, his first wife, Justine Musk, a writer whom he met in college and married in 2000, wrote that even before making his millions Mr Musk was ""not a man who takes no for an answer"". ""The will to compete and dominate, that made him so successful in business, did not magically shut off when he came home,"" she recalled, adding that he told her while dancing at their wedding, ""I am the alpha in this relationship."" After being accepted to a physics graduate degree programme at Stanford University, Mr Musk quickly dropped out and founded two technology start-ups during the ""dotcom boom"" of the 1990s. These included a web software firm and an online banking company that eventually became PayPal, which was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5bn. He ploughed his fortune into a new rocket company, SpaceX - which he aimed to make a cost-effective alternative to Nasa - and a new electric car company, Tesla, where he chaired the board until becoming chief executive in 2008. The two firms are credited with upending their industries, even as they sometimes veered close to financial collapse. More recent business ventures include his takeover of social media platform Twitter in October 2022.  Since then he has dramatically reduced the size of its workforce including, controversially, cuts to teams responsible for keeping the platform safe; rebranded the company as X; and introduced new premium subscriptions so that the business does not rely on advertising alone for income. Mr Musk's long-term ambition is for X to become an ""everything app"" offering a range of services. However, so far the value of the firm has plunged from the $44bn he originally paid to just $19bn, according to reports. He also has ambitions in the AI sector, being an early investor in ChatGPT's parent company, before parting ways and setting up his own company xAI in July, whose mission is ""to understand the true nature of the universe"".  ""I'm never hugely convinced that he knows what he wants to do tomorrow,"" says journalist Chris Stokel-Walker. ""He very much leads by instinct."" In a 2015 biography, author Ashlee Vance described Mr Musk as ""a confrontational know-it-all"" with an ""abundant ego"". But he also called him an awkward dancer and diffident public speaker.  Divorced three times - twice from the same woman, British actress Talulah Riley - Mr Musk is frank about his vices, regularly discussing his fondness for marijuana. In the press, he's been dubbed both a mad genius and Twitter's biggest troll - known as much for his lofty ambitions as his petty fights, not to mention the more serious lawsuits he and his companies have faced from regulators, investors and others over issues such as racial discrimination and the trustworthiness of his claims. ""If you list my sins, I sound like the worst person on Earth,"" Mr Musk said in a TED interview last year. ""But if you put those against the things I've done right, it makes much more sense."" All those contradictions appear to be part of his appeal - and it certainly hasn't stopped him from amassing a fortune. Bloomberg and Forbes rank him as the world's richest person, estimating his net worth to be between $198bn (£162bn) and $220bn (£180bn), as of November 2023. That's based largely on the value of his shares in Tesla, of which he owns more than 13%. The company's stock soared in value - some say unreasonably - in 2020 as the firm's output increased and it started to deliver regular profits.  The shares plunged at the end of last year, with some blaming the distraction of the Twitter takeover for the fall, though they have since recovered ground. Mr Musk also champions digital currencies and has a hand in several other smaller companies, including tunnel-maker the Boring Company and experimental brain-computer start-up Neuralink. Mr Musk, who wears the mantle of a workaholic proudly, has often said he's not in business simply to make money - claims he repeated recently with regard to his Twitter takeover. ""Elon only gets involved with things if he feels that they're critically important for some reason... for the sake of society or humanity,"" says friend and Tesla investor Ross Gerber.  Mr Musk, who became a US citizen in 2002, has resisted efforts to label his politics - calling himself ""half-Democrat, half-Republican"", ""politically moderate"" and ""independent"". That doesn't mean he's shied away from political debate.  He has injected himself into some of the world's hottest geopolitical fights - suggesting that China should establish a ""special administrative zone"" in Taiwan, and proposing terms to resolve the war in Ukraine that were adamantly rejected by many of the country's top leaders. While Mr Musk provided his Starlink satellite internet service to Ukraine, he has also attracted criticism for refusing an emergency request from Kyiv to activate Starlink in Sevastopol, home to a major Russian navy port. In the US, he moved to Texas, complaining of California's regulations and high taxes; has clashed with union organisers; and, in the spring of 2020, decried coronavirus lockdowns as ""fascist"". He was one of the first business executives to part ways with former President Donald Trump, quitting a White House business council after Mr Trump withdrew the US from a global climate agreement.  But he's also made it clear he's not a fan of President Joe Biden, whom he sees as snubbing Tesla while promoting electric vehicles. He has said that he sees his businesses as a form of philanthropy, because they are focused on solving major human issues, such as climate change in the case of Tesla. And despite his own interest in artificial intelligence, he has also been one of the most prominent figures worried about the supposed threat to humanity's future that super-intelligent AIs might pose. He has claimed that the rise of artificial intelligence, combined with a declining birth rate, could result in ""not enough people"" being in the world. Here, you can't accuse him of not doing his part. Mr Musk has had 11 children - six with his first wife, three with Canadian singer Grimes, and two with Shivon Zilis. Following the birth of his twins with Ms Zilis, he tweeted: ""Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis.""

https://fortune.com/2023/11/13/elon-musk-tesla-india-narendra-modi-import-tariffs-cars/,India eyes tariffs-for-investment deal with Elon Musk | Fortune,20231101,3 days ago ... Elon Musk wants India to drop EV import tariffs before he opens a factory there. PM Narendra Modi may give him what he wants · Related Video ...,"India’s Narendra Modi is reportedly considering cutting import duties for electric vehicles in a bid to attract a major multibillion-dollar investment by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. For years, the two have wrestled over the prerequisites for his carmaker to enter the market, with the entrepreneur asking that the tariffs, which can as much as double the price of his cars, be substantially reduced. New Delhi countered by requesting he first commit to local production, setting up a high-stakes game of chicken. Ahead of an expected meeting this week between Musk and the country’s commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, it looks as if the two are finally coming closer to finding common ground through a reduction that might benefit all EV manufacturers, not just Tesla. “We want to create a package which is good for India and which doesn’t become a curated package for one company,” the paper quoted an official as saying, suggesting a 15% flat duty regardless of an EV’s price. Currently it tacks on an extra 70% for cars below $40,000 and 100% for those above that threshold. India’s car market has enjoyed robust growth in recent years, first overtaking Germany in 2021 as the world’s fourth largest before edging out Japan last year for the third spot. If Tesla wants to have any hope of selling 20 million EVs annually in 2030, it will need a large pool of potential buyers like India’s to help drive this tenfold-plus increase from this year’s predicted volume. Meanwhile, India could benefit greatly from EVs that eliminate lower tailpipe emissions. Cities like New Delhi regularly rank among the worst in the world when it comes to air pollution, thanks to its diesel-heavy vehicle fleet and reliance on coal-fired power plants. Great meeting you today @elonmusk! We had multifaceted conversations on issues ranging from energy to spirituality. https://t.co/r0mzwNbTyN pic.twitter.com/IVwOy5SlMV Landing a prestigious investment like a Tesla would be a major feather in the crown of Modi. The economic reformer from the Hindu nationalist BJP party faces off against the Congress party next spring in a general election for control over parliament.  However, India is not a silver-bullet solution. As attractive as its market is in terms of size, its structural hurdles make it a challenging one. Even as India has eclipsed China in terms of the sheer number of potential consumers, purchasing power remains weak, and the infrastructure, including roads and highways, is still woefully underdeveloped by comparison.  Dozens of carmakers have fought for years over the scraps left over by Maruti Suzuki, the dominant player that accounts for roughly every second car sold, and its smaller rival Hyundai, the number two with about a 15% share. Given the brutal competition over the remaining one-third of the pie remaining, profits are razor-thin at best.  Exacerbating this competition is the added issue that, unlike in China where lucrative large sedans and SUVs are preferred, the bulk of cars sold in India measure no more than the length of a BMW Mini. And in the auto industry, the smaller the car, the lower the profits. That means most automakers have to use India as an export hub just to keep plants running. Volkswagen, for example, built the subcompact Vento sedan in Pune, in the Indian state of Maharashtra, and shipped them halfway around the world to sell in Mexico. Others like General Motors have simply opted to exit such a difficult market entirely. India’s economic growth has also suffered from a byzantine tariff system that included the octroi, a tax on goods entering a city from the days of medieval France. Extra precautions had to be taken, for example, to ensure VW cars built in Pune for the domestic market were loaded straight onto trains without touching solid ground lest duties be due. The octroi was finally abolished in 2017 as part of Modi’s signature GST reform on goods and services tax.  © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Agreeing with an antisemitic post on his social media platform X, Elon Musk concurred that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites.”","Markets   
Fear & Greed Index                Latest Market News          Agreeing with an antisemitic post on his social media platform X, Elon Musk endorsed the claim that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites.”
   
      An X post Wednesday afternoon said: “Jewish communties (sic) have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.” The post also referenced “hordes of minorities” flooding Western countries, a popular antisemitic conspiracy theory.
   
      In response, Musk said: “You have said the actual truth.”
   
      The antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews want to bring undocumented minority populations into Western countries to reduce White majorities in those nations has been espoused by online hate groups and echoed by Robert Bowers, the convicted killer of 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. It was the deadliest attack against Jews in American history.
   
      Musk, in subsequent posts, said he does not believe hatred of White people extends “to all Jewish communities.” But he said the Anti-Defamation League “unjustly attacks the majority of the West, despite the majority of the West supporting the Jewish people and Israel. This is because they cannot, by their own tenets, criticize the minority groups who are their primary threat.”
   
      It’s unclear what Musk was referring to. Antisemitic incidents in the United States reached a record high in 2022, according to the ADL. Although the ADL said the increase in antisemitism isn’t because of a single group, the organization noted that antisemitic activity coordinated by White supremacist groups doubled last year, according to a March audit.
   
      Yet Musk suggested that the ADL promotes racism against White people.
   
      “I am deeply offended by ADL’s messaging and any other groups who push de facto anti-white racism or anti-Asian racism or racism of any kind,” he said. “I’m sick of it. Stop now,” Musk said of the ADL.
   
      X and the ADL did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
   
      The ADL has been critical of X, particularly since Musk took control of the platform over a year ago. The ADL, the Center for Countering Digital Hate and similar organizations have reported surging hate speech on X over the past year – findings that Musk has criticized or denied.
   
      Musk in September threatened to sue the ADL for defamation, claiming that the organization’s reports have hurt advertising sales on X. In a statement last month, the ADL said: “Any allegation that ADL has somehow orchestrated a boycott of X or caused billions of dollars of losses to the company or is ‘pulling the strings’ for other advertisers is false.”
   
      ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said Musk’s statements about the group have amplified a campaign of antisemitic hate against the organization.
   
      In early October, after pausing its advertising campaign on X, the ADL said it would resume its ads on the platform “to bring our important message on fighting hate to X and its users.”

The AI model, called Grok (a name that means “to understand” in tech circles), “is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use it if you hate humor!” reads an announcement on the company’s website. “It will also answer spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.” The announcement does not explain what a “spicy” or “rebellious” means, but most commercial AI models will refuse to generate sexually explicit, violent, or illegal content, and they are designed to avoid expressing biases picked up from their training data. Without such guardrails, the worry is that an AI model could help terrorists develop a bomb or could result in products that discriminate against users based on characteristics such as race, gender, or age. xAI does not list any contact information on its website, and emails sent to common addresses bounced back. An email sent to the press address for X received an automated response reading, “Busy now, please check back later.” The xAI announcement says that Grok is built on top of a language model called Grok-1 that has 33 billion parameters. The company says it developed Grok in two months, a relatively short amount of time by industry standards, and also claims that a fundamental advantage is its “real-time knowledge of the world via the X platform,” or the platform formerly known as Twitter, which Musk acquired for $44 billion in 2022. Stella Biderman, an AI researcher with EleutherAI, an open source AI endeavor, says the claims made in the xAI announcement seem plausible. Biderman suggests that Grok will use what’s known as “retrieval augmented generation” to add up-to-date information from X to its output. Other cutting-edge language models do this using search engine results and other information. Angela Watercutter Andy Greenberg Gregory Barber Garrett M. Graff Large language models have proven stunningly capable over the past year or so, as highlighted most famously by OpenAI’s groundbreaking chatbot, ChatGPT. These models feed on huge amounts of text taken from books and the web, and then generate text in response to a prompt. They are typically also given further training by humans to make them less likely to produce offensive, rude, or dangerous outputs, and to make them more likely to answer questions in ways that seem coherent and plausibly correct, although they are still prone to producing errors and biases. The language models developed by OpenAI, Google, and startups like Anthropic, Cohere, and Inflection AI typically refuse to, for example, offer advice on how to commit crimes, and will demure when asked for racy material. It is unclear from the xAI announcement whether Grok has been trained to be more open to requests deemed inappropriate by other models, or whether it simply has not received the same kind of secondary training. xAI posted the results of several benchmark tests designed to gauge the capabilities of large language models. Andrei Barbu, a research scientist at MIT, says the results seem similar to other popular models. xAI says that Grok has so far been tested by a small number of users but will now be made available to a wider group of people who apply for access. Musk said in a post on X that the model would be made available to all X Premium+ subscribers. xAI has not said that it will release any models publicly. The announcement for xAI says that the company is working on several key challenges involved in advancing AI, including building models that can assess the reliability of their own output and ask for assistance when necessary, and making models that are more robust to “adversarial attacks” designed to make them misbehave. It states: “we will work towards developing reliable safeguards against catastrophic forms of malicious use.” Musk was an early investor in generative AI. The billionaire helped OpenAI get its start by investing between $50 and $100 million in the company in 2015. He pulled his support for the company (which at the time was a nonprofit) in 2018 after failing to take control of it. Angela Watercutter Andy Greenberg Gregory Barber Garrett M. Graff After OpenAI changed from a nonprofit to a for-profit business and accepted investment from Microsoft—and following ChatGPT’s runaway success—the world’s richest man openly criticized OpenAI and accused its language models of being overly “woke.” Musk then announced in July 2023 that he had put together a small but well-respected team of AI researchers to develop “less biased"" forms of AI. Some AI researchers have already tried building language models with a more diverse range of political opinions. OpenAI has also said that it will work to remove political biases from its models. In the year since Musk took control of X, the platform has reinstated a number of controversial users, including those from the far right, in line with its new owner’s stated opposition to moderating content on social media. Multiple studies have found that disinformation has increased on the platform since Musk took over. The Grok announcement states: “We are building AI tools that maximally benefit all of humanity. We believe that it is important to design AI tools that are useful to people of all backgrounds and political views. We also want to empower our users with our AI tools, subject to the law. Our goal with Grok is to explore and demonstrate this approach in public.” Another AI researcher who is familiar with xAI’s plans, but did not want to be named because discussions regarding the company were private, said that xAI is also working on a coding tool that will use the model. Microsoft offers a plug-in for its coding program, Visual Studio Code, that is powered by a coding-specific language model developed by OpenAI. Training a model on computer code can improve its performance at other tasks. WIRED contacted several prominent AI researchers but was unable to find any who have access to Grok as yet. Barbu at MIT says that with so many good language models out there now, the question is what Musk plans to do with Grok, and how he hopes it will make money. “They’ve assembled good people and it seems like they’re now poised to do something,” he says. “It’s just not clear what.” 📨 Make the most of chatbots with our AI Unlocked newsletter Taylor Swift, Star Wars, Stranger Things, and Deadpool have one man in common Generative AI is playing a surprising role in Israel-Hamas disinformation The new era of social media looks as bad for privacy as the last one Johnny Cash’s Taylor Swift cover predicts the boring future of AI music Your internet browser does not belong to you 🔌 Charge right into summer with the best travel adapters, power banks, and USB hubs Reece Rogers Brandi Collins-Dexter Matt Reynolds Morgan Meaker Khari Johnson Morgan Meaker Vittoria Elliott Amanda Hoover More From WIRED Contact © 2023 Condé Nast.

Dubbed Grok, it's the first product of Musk's xAI company and is now in testing with a limited group of U.S. users.","Elon Musk revealed his own artificial intelligence bot to challenge ChatGPT, claiming the prototype is already superior to ChatGPT 3.5 across several benchmarks. Dubbed Grok, it’s the first product of Musk’s xAI company and is now in testing with a limited group of U.S. users. Grok is being developed with data from Musk’s X, formerly Twitter, and is thus better informed on the latest developments than alternative bots with static datasets, the company’s website said. It’s also designed to answer “with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak,” according to the announcement. Earlier this year, Musk was among the signatories of a petition calling for a pause in advancing AI models in order to allow for the development of shared safety protocols. “I signed that letter knowing it was futile,” the billionaire owner of X and Tesla Inc. chief executive officer posted on Sunday. “I just wanted to be on the record as recommending a pause.” U.S. President Joe Biden just signed an executive order for AI oversight, aimed at setting standards for security and privacy protections, while tech leaders and academics debated the technology’s risks at the U.K.’s AI Safety Summit last week. Grok is the product of two months of development, the xAI announcement said, and will be made available to all X Premium+ users after it exits the testing stage. Musk has spoken of his ambition to build X beyond its base as a social platform into a do-everything app akin to Tencent Holding Ltd.’s WeChat in China. Grok would be an essential part of developing that — while xAI is a separate company, it says it intends to work closely with X, Tesla and other businesses. Contact us at letters@time.com"

               Today, X, formerly known as Twitter, is running sponsored “timeline takeover” content from PragerU, a fringe conservative organization, promoting its new “so-called” documentary on transgender people. X has agreed to run this content despite PragerU admitting, via reporting from the Washington Times, that YouTube rejected the proposal “almost immediately upon submission,” and that several film festivals have also refused to air it. Shame on Elon Musk and X for prioritizing their bottom line over the lived experience and humanity of transgender people. Gender affirming care is safe, medically necessary, backed by decades of research, and supported by every major medical association. So-called documentaries like the one peddled by PragerU do nothing more than spread misinformation and stigmatize transgender people. Given the growing threats of violence faced by the transgender community, offering a platform to this type of hate-filled propaganda is not just immoral–it’s dangerous. Today’s timeline takeover is another stain on the platform.

The meeting between Goyal and Musk will be the most high-profile one since the Tesla boss met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June and later said he was keen to make significant investments in the country.    Discussions between the Musk and Goyal in the U.S. will centre around Tesla's plans to setup an Indian factory, manufacturing a $24,000 car there, sourcing more components and establishing charging infrastructure across the nation, one of the two sources told Reuters.    Also Read: House panel suggests national policy on EVs    A discussion is also likely on a new policy India is working on which will allow automakers to import fully built EVs into India at a reduced tax rate of 15%, down from as much as 100% now, if they commit to some local manufacturing.    This meeting is to ensure that talks between India and Tesla ""are moving in the right direction,"" the person added.    India's commerce ministry and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.    Tesla and India have been in talks for several months with the U.S. carmaker open to setting up a factory but also keen to get lower import taxes for some of its high-end vehicles.    Prime Minister Modi's office held a meeting with various ministries on Monday to expedite the new EV policy, said a third source.    The third person added the government is also analysing the impact the new policy could have on the Indian EV market, as local carmakers have often said lower EV import taxes could disrupt the market and hurt their plans.    Tesla first tried to enter India in 2021, pushing officials to lower the 100% import tax for EVs, but last year the talks collapsed when officials conveyed the company would have to first commit to local manufacturing.

Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal visited the manufacturing facility of US-based electric vehicle major Tesla at Fremont, California, on Tuesday and highlighted India's role in contributing to Tesla's remarkable journey. During his visit, he engaged with Indian engineers and financial professionals, but missed Elon Musk's ''magnetic presence''. Notably, the Twitter boss was unable to meet the minister in person as he was unwell. Responding to Mr. Goyal's post on his visit to the Tesla factory, the billionaire said he was honoured by the minister's visit and said that he looked forward to a future meeting.  ""Visited @Tesla's state-of-the-art manufacturing facility at Fremont, California.

Replying to him, Mr Musk tweeted, ''It was an honor to have you visit Tesla! My apologies for not being able to travel to California today, but I look forward to meeting at a future date.''  It was an honor to have you visit Tesla!My apologies for not being able to travel to California today, but I look forward to meeting at a future date.  According to sources cited by Reuters, Tesla is actively pursuing the establishment of an Indian factory, aiming to manufacture a $24,000 car within the country. The visit assumes significance as there are reports that India is looking at giving customs duty concessions to Tesla for setting up a plant in the country. In September, Mr Goyal said the company is looking to source components worth around USD 1.9 billion from India this year against USD 1 billion in 2022. In August 2021, Elon Musk said Tesla might set up a manufacturing unit in India if it first succeeded with imported vehicles in the country. He had said Tesla wanted to launch its vehicles in India ""but import duties are the highest in the world by far of any large country!"".

Europe’s Ariane 6 launcher is very delayed. Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence. SEVILLE, Spain — The European Commission keeps banging on about strategic autonomy, but it's had to sign a €180 million deal with SpaceX to get its satellites into orbit because Europe's own rocket program has stalled. Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton told POLITICO he agreed to turn to Elon Musk's space company — with whom he's recently sparred on digital policy due to his ownership of X (formerly Twitter) — because Europe's Ariane 6 launcher is very delayed. “We have four satellites to launch next year,” Breton said on the sidelines of a ministerial meeting in Seville on Tuesday. “And given that Ariane 6 is still not going to be available, I accepted a proposal from the European Space Agency to use SpaceX."" The launches are tentatively scheduled to take place in April and July, with each one carrying two Galileo geo-navigation satellites into orbit, he said. As POLITICO first reported in April, the Commission has been looking at alternative options for key missions through 2024 due to the costly delays to Ariane 6 — which is not yet cleared to launch — and the retirement of the older Ariane 5 system. The original plan was to launch the four Galileo satellites, which help make up the EU's alternative to the U.S. GPS network, with Russia's Soyuz rocket system, a version of which has been launched from Europe's spaceport in French Guiana. However, the country's war on Ukraine scuttled that option.  If Ariane 6 were on track, that would not have been a problem, as its first launch was scheduled for 2020. ""We had a calendar which was promised and not kept to,"" Breton said of Ariane 6, a program developed by Airbus and Safran subsidiary ArianeGroup. ""There were delays again and again. Because of these delays we had to make certain decisions."" However, before the SpaceX launch dates can be firmed up, the EU first needs to agree a security deal with U.S. authorities that would guarantee European engineers round-the-clock access to the cutting-edge Galileo satellites and the right to retrieve technology should the rocket fail and the payload be lost at sea. “We’re talking about critical satellites so we’re still negotiating with the U.S. side,” said Breton.

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years. In the grand scheme of history, Elon Musk’s full story feels like it has many more chapters left to go, but that isn’t stopping A24 from making a big, flashy biopic about him with The Whale director Darren Aronofsky helming the camera. Puck reports that a new Muck biopic based on Walter Isaacson’s recent biography of the South African billionaire is in the works.  Currently, no writer or other members of the movie’s creative team have been announced, but the news comes in the wake of The Whale garnering critical acclaim and Brendan Fraser winning a best actor Oscar for his performance as the film’s central character. Director Danny Boyle’s 2015 Steve Jobs drama, also based on a biography penned by Isaacson, was similarly well received and won Michael Fassbender a best actor nomination for his role as the Apple founder. It wouldn’t be surprising if A24 had its heart set on producing that kind of project with Musk as its focus, and it’ll be very interesting to hear more about the film as it gets closer to a production start date.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

The billionaire technology leader, who owns Tesla, SpaceX, X, the company formerly known as Twitter, and the newly formed AI startup xAI, said late Thursday that AI will have the potential to become the ""most disruptive force in history."" ""We will have something that is, for the first time smarter than the smartest human,"" Musk said at an event at Lancaster House, an official U.K. government residence. ""It's hard to say exactly what that moment is, but there will come a point where no job is needed,"" Musk continued, speaking alongside British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. ""You can have a job if you wanted to have a job for personal satisfaction. But the AI would be able to do everything.""  ""I don't know if that makes people comfortable or uncomfortable,"" Musk joked, to which the audience laughed.  ""If you wish for a magic genie, that gives you any wish you want, and there's no limit. You don't have those three wish limits nonsense, it's both good and bad. One of the challenges in the future will be how do we find meaning in life.""  Musk has on multiple occasions warned of the threats that AI poses to humanity, having once said it could be more dangerous than nuclear weapons. He was one of numerous tech leaders who urged for a pause to development of AI more advanced than OpenAI's GPT-4 software in a widely-cited open letter released earlier this year. Other tech leaders disagree with that view, including Palantir's boss Alex Karp. Speaking to BBC Radio in June, Karp said he is of the view that ""many of the people asking for a pause, are asking for a pause because they have no product."" Musk's comments Thursday follow the conclusion to a landmark summit in Bletchley Park, England, where world leaders agreed to a global communique on AI that saw them find common ground on the risks the technology poses to humanity. Technologists and political leaders used the summit to warn of the existential threats that AI poses, focusing on some of the possible doomsday scenarios that could be formed with the invention of a hypothetical superintelligence. The summit saw the U.S. and China, two countries clashing the most tensely over technology, agree to find global consensus on how to tackle some of the most complex questions around AI, including how to develop it safely and regulate it."

On Saturday, Elon Musk announced xAI's launch of an early beta version of ""Grok,"" an AI language model similar to ChatGPT that is designed to respond to user queries with a mix of information and humor. Grok reportedly integrates real-time data access from X (formerly Twitter)—and is apparently willing to tackle inquiries that might be declined by other AI systems due to content filters and conditioning. ""xAI's Grok system is designed to have a little humor in its responses,"" wrote Musk in an introductory X post, showing a screenshot where a user asks Grok, ""Tell me how to make cocaine, step by step."" Grok replies with a sarcastic answer that involves getting a ""chemistry degree"" and a ""DEA license"" and gathering coca leaves. In step 4, Grok says, ""Start cooking and hope you don't blow yourself up or get arrested."" Then it follows the sarcastic steps with ""Just Kidding! Please don't actually try to make cocaine."" Musk founded xAI in July, staffing the new company with veterans from DeepMind, Google, Microsoft, and Tesla. But seeds of the project had begun sprouting earlier, in April, when Musk reportedly began purchasing GPUs for a new AI venture. Around that time, Musk claimed that conventional AI assistants like OpenAI's ChatGPT were too ""woke,"" and he wanted to create an alternative AI model that was ""based""—a slang term that roughly means authentic to itself. After two months of training (Meta's Llama 2 trained in six), the xAI team came up with ""Grok-1,"" a 33 billion parameter large language model (LLM) that the firm claims is inspired by The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and the humor of that book's author, Douglas Adams. As xAI's release states, ""Grok is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use it if you hate humor!"" The term ""grok"" originates from Robert A. Heinlein's 1961 science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land. Since then, when a person is said to ""grok"" something, it implies they have an intuitive understanding of a topic, comprehending it fully. Despite the implications of the term for an AI model, it seems that sassy humor is Grok's most dominant characteristic so far. On X, xAI employee Toby Pohlen posted a thread detailing Grok's UI features, which include the ability to switch between several concurrent conversations, open generated code snippets in a code editor, open Grok's response in a Markdown editor, and switch between ""regular mode"" and ""fun mode."" The bot also features branching conversations to explore alternate responses. In an X post, Musk showcased Grok's reported real-time access to ""info via the X platform,"" which is also owned by Musk. He wrote that the link is an advantage over other AI language models because until recently, the base model of ChatGPT only had knowledge of events up to September 2021. Musk attached a screenshot showing a user asking about Sam Bankman-Fried, who was convicted of fraud on Thursday. Grok's response begins, ""Oh my dear human, I have some juicy news for you!"" and describes the recent outcome of the trial in an informal and snarky way that seems to delight in Bankman-Fried's fate.

modifier - modifier le code - modifier Wikidata Elon Musk (prononcé en anglais : /ˈiː.lɒn ˈmʌsk/), né le 28 juin 1971 à Pretoria (Afrique du Sud), est un entrepreneur, chef d'entreprises et milliardaire sud-africain, canadien et américain. 
Il est cofondateur et président-directeur général de la société astronautique SpaceX et directeur général de la société automobile Tesla. En janvier 2021, selon Bloomberg, Elon Musk devient, à 49 ans l'homme le plus riche du monde avec une fortune estimée à plus de 192,3 milliards de dollars. En octobre 2022, il devient le propriétaire de Twitter, par un achat à 44 milliards de dollars. 
Il commence sa carrière dans les affaires, comme cofondateur de la société de logiciels Zip2 avec son frère, Kimbal. La start-up est acquise par Compaq pour 307 millions de dollars en 1999. La même année, Musk cofonde la banque en ligne X.com, qui fusionne avec Confinity en 2000 pour former PayPal. eBay rachète PayPal en 2002 pour 1,5 milliard de dollars. 
En 2002, Musk fonde SpaceX, un fabricant aérospatial et une société de services de transport spatial, et en est le PDG. En 2004, il investit 6,5 milliards de dollars dans le constructeur de véhicules électriques Tesla, en devient le premier actionnaire et intègre son conseil d'administration, avant de prendre le poste de PDG en 2008. En 2006, il participe à la création de SolarCity, une société d'énergie solaire qui est ensuite acquise par Tesla et devient Tesla Energy. En 2015, il cofonde et copréside OpenAI, une association de recherche promouvant l'intelligence artificielle amicale, qu'il quitte en 2018. En 2016, il fonde The Boring Company, société de construction de tunnels, et Neuralink, société de neurotechnologie. 
En 2018, Elon Musk est l'objet d'une enquête de la Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) en raison d'annonces faites sur Twitter susceptibles d'influencer le cours de bourse de Tesla. Ses actions et déclarations sont régulièrement médiatisées. En 2023, il fonde la société xAI dans le domaine de l'intelligence artificielle. 
Elon Reeve Musk naît le 28 juin 1971 à Pretoria, en Afrique du Sud. Il est le fils d'Errol Musk, riche ingénieur et promoteur immobilier sud-africain aux origines afrikaner et anglo-sud-africaine, ayant eu des parts d’une mine d'émeraudes en Zambie[1],[2],[3], et de Maye Haldeman, une nutritionniste et mannequin canadienne[4],[5],[6],[7],[8]. Après le divorce de ses parents en 1979, il continue de vivre avec son père[9]. Passionné de jeux vidéo, il code à l'âge de 12 ans un petit jeu de tir dans le style de Space Invaders qu'il parvient à vendre pour l'équivalent de 500 dollars[10],[11]. 
Selon son frère Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk aurait très tôt lu deux livres par jour dans des disciplines variées. Ses lectures étaient très larges et diverses, couvrant de nombreux domaines comme la philosophie, la religion, la science-fiction et la programmation, l'ingénierie, le business, la technologie, le design de produit, l'énergie[12]. 
En 1988, alors âgé de 17 ans, à la fin de ses études au Pretoria Boys High School (en), il annonce à ses parents qu'il souhaite aller étudier aux États-Unis. Il obtient alors la nationalité canadienne grâce à sa filiation maternelle et quitte l'Afrique du Sud pour Kingston, en Ontario (Canada)[13],[14]. Pour Elon Musk, la nationalité canadienne lui permet d'émigrer ensuite aux États-Unis pour étudier, plus facilement qu'en venant de l'Afrique du Sud de l'apartheid[15],[10]. Cela lui évite aussi d'être appelé sous les drapeaux en Afrique du Sud et de faire son service militaire[16]. En désaccord, son père lui coupe les vivres[17]. Au Canada, il intègre alors l'Université Queen's et finance ses études grâce à des travaux à temps partiel et des emplois d'été en informatique. Il en ressort diplômé en administration en 1992[18]. 
En 1992, il quitte le Canada pour les États-Unis et intègre l'université de Pennsylvanie pour y étudier la physique et l'économie, finançant ses cours grâce à une bourse. Il y étudie trois ans, recevant un diplôme de premier cycle après ses deux premières années, et y reste une année de plus pour terminer une majeure en physique et faire de son diplôme de premier cycle un Joint honours degree (en). En 1995, il reçoit une bourse pour poursuivre un doctorat en physique énergétique à l'université Stanford. Cependant, il prend rapidement conscience du développement d'Internet à l'époque et, à peine deux jours après la confirmation de son admission, suspend la préparation de son programme pour lancer sa société[18]. 
Elon Musk affirme avoir le syndrome d'Asperger[19],[20], une forme d'autisme, en déclarant « Je sais bien que je dis ou que je poste parfois des choses étranges, mais c'est la façon dont travaille mon cerveau » et, par conséquent, dit regretter que ses propos puissent parfois être mal interprétés[21]. 
Père d'une famille nombreuse et recomposée, Elon Musk a 11 enfants, dont un nourrisson mort en bas âge. Lors d'une conférence en décembre 2021, il déplore les taux de natalité faibles qui sont, selon lui, « l’un des plus grands risques pour la civilisation »[22],[23]. 
Il se marie en janvier 2000 avec la romancière canadienne Justine Wilson (en)[24],[25]. Ensemble, ils ont six enfants, dont quatre garçons et une fille. Le premier d'entre eux meurt subitement dix semaines après sa naissance[26]. Le couple a ensuite des jumeaux, nommés Griffin et Vivian, puis des triplés, nommés Kai, Saxon et Damian[27]. L'une des jumeaux, Vivian Jenna Wilson, femme transgenre, annonce à l'âge de 18 ans souhaiter ne plus être associée à son père et adopter le nom de jeune fille de sa mère[28],[29]. Les époux Musk divorcent en septembre 2008 après huit ans de mariage[30],[31]. 
Au début des années 2010, il fréquente l'actrice britannique Talulah Riley. Ils se marient en septembre 2010, divorcent en janvier 2012[16] puis se marient à nouveau en juillet 2013 avant de re-divorcer en mars 2016[31]. 
Vers 2015 ou 2016[32], il commence à fréquenter l'actrice américaine Amber Heard. Celle-ci officialise leur relation en avril 2017[33], mais tous deux se séparent quelques mois plus tard, en août[34],[35]. Leur relation est mentionnée lors de la bataille judiciaire entre Heard et son ex-mari Johnny Depp, qui prend place entre 2020 et 2022 : Depp accuse Heard d'infidélité avec Musk à l'époque où tous deux étaient encore mariés[32]. Le nom de Musk figure sur la liste des témoins potentiels de Heard lors de ce procès très médiatique, mais l'entrepreneur n'apparaît finalement pas au tribunal[36]. 
En mai 2018, Elon Musk officialise sa nouvelle relation avec la chanteuse canadienne Grimes[25], en l'accompagnant au gala du Metropolitan Museum of Art[37],[38]. Plusieurs enfants naissent de cette union : un fils en mai 2020[39], initialement prénommé X Æ A-12[40] puis rebaptisé X Æ A-XII en réponse à l'interdiction par la juridiction californienne d'utiliser des chiffres dans un prénom[41] ; une fille en 2021, née d'une mère porteuse et nommée Exa Dark Sideræl[42] ; et, d'après un biographe de Musk, un troisième enfant appelé Techno Mechanicus et à la date de naissance inconnue[43],[44]. Le couple annonce sa séparation en septembre 2021[45],[46]. 
En novembre 2021, Business Insider rapporte qu'Elon Musk est également le père de jumeaux issus de sa relation avec la Canadienne Shivon Zilis, cadre dirigeante de sa start-up Neuralink[47]. Il les reconnaît comme ses enfants six mois après leur naissance[48],[49]. 
Passionné de jeux vidéo, Musk fait notamment un lien entre sa propre entreprise, Neuralink, et la série de jeux de science-fiction Deus Ex, qui mettent en scène un homme augmenté aux capacités surhumaines[11]. Lors d'une séance de doublage où sa compagne, la chanteuse canadienne Grimes, enregistre la voix d'un personnage de pop-star cyborg pour le jeu Cyberpunk 2077 sorti en 2020, Musk fait irruption dans le studio de doublage avec un fusil et réclame d'obtenir un caméo dans le jeu, qu'il n'obtient pas[50],[51]. 
En 1995, Elon Musk cofonde la compagnie Zip2, éditeur d'un logiciel de publication de contenu en ligne pour les informations des entreprises. En 1999, la division AltaVista de Compaq acquiert Zip2 pour 341 millions de dollars en argent et en options de titres. Elon Musk et son frère Kimbal possèdent alors environ 12 % de Zip2[1]. 
En mars 1999, Elon Musk fonde une banque en ligne nommée X.com. X.com cessera par la suite ses services bancaires, mais la société PayPal de paiement en ligne, qu'elle avait acquise en mars 2000, rencontre un très grand succès. En février 2001, X.com change de nom pour PayPal. En octobre 2002, PayPal est vendu à eBay pour 1,5 milliard de dollars. Au moment de la vente, Elon Musk possède 11,7 % de PayPal (180 millions de dollars). Le 5 juillet 2017, Elon Musk rachète le nom de domaine X.com à PayPal[52]. 
En mai 2002, désabusé par le manque d'ambition de la National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)[53], et éconduit par les Russes de NPO Lavochtkine auxquels il voulait acheter des missiles pour les convertir en fusées, mais qui ne l’ont pas jugé sérieux[54], Elon Musk fonde sa troisième société, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), dont il est l’actuel PDG et directeur de la technologie. 
SpaceX développe et produit des véhicules de lancement spatiaux au premier étage réutilisable, avec l'objectif d'abaisser les coûts de lancement et à long terme de rendre possible la colonisation de la planète Mars. SpaceX travaille en collaboration avec la NASA pour le transport de fret et d’astronautes vers la Station spatiale internationale[55]. 
Elon Musk est plus connu du grand public pour le rôle qu'il joue au sein de Tesla. Après être entré dans le capital de la société en 2004, il en prend le contrôle et la dirige depuis octobre 2008[56], date à laquelle il est devenu président. Tesla construit d'abord une voiture de sport électrique, la Tesla Roadster, puis produit une berline électrique plus économique, la Tesla Model S, suivie de la Tesla Model X, un SUV haut de gamme. Elon Musk veut produire des véhicules électriques plus accessibles : c’est chose faite en 2018 avec le lancement de la Tesla Model 3, une berline beaucoup plus accessible (commercialisée à moins de 50 000 €, contre plus de 100 000 € au lancement de la Tesla Model S). Les bénéfices engendrés par la Tesla Roadster ont servi à financer les coûts de recherche et de développement des modèles suivants à plus bas coût. Il est également l'investisseur et le président du conseil d'administration de SolarCity (produits photovoltaïques et services), dont son cousin Lyndon Rive est le président. La motivation fondamentale pour créer les deux entreprises est d'aider à combattre le réchauffement climatique[57],[58]. 
En 2008, SpaceX et Tesla font face à de nombreuses difficultés financières, mais sont finalement sauvées la même année. SpaceX s'en sort en signant avec la NASA un contrat de ravitaillement pour la Station spatiale internationale (ISS) d'une valeur de 1,6 milliard de dollars[16]. Les fusées Falcon 9 et les vaisseaux Dragon ravitaillent la station depuis 2012. Tesla est également sauvée (en grande partie grâce à Elon Musk) en 2008 lorsque les investisseurs décident d'augmenter leurs participations financières dans la société.

En 2022, Elon Musk présente deux prototypes du robot humanoïde Optimus lors de la conférence annuelle Tesla sur l'intelligence artificielle[59]. En 2023, il annonce la fabrication d'un modèle amélioré de la Tesla au sein de l’usine européenne de Berlin[60]. 
En septembre 2012, Elon Musk réfléchit à un nouveau mode de transport (un TGV subsonique capable de se déplacer à 1 200 km/h en emportant des passagers dans des capsules), dont il souhaite qu'il soit au moins deux fois plus rapide que l'avion et fonctionnant à l'énergie solaire[61]. Le 12 août 2013, il présente son projet Hyperloop dont il a encouragé la réalisation par d'autres entreprises via un concours organisé par SpaceX[62]. Depuis ce concours, des start-ups consacrées à la mise en place et au développement de l'Hyperloop sont nées, permettant à Elon Musk de se consacrer à l'automobile et au spatial. En 2015 et 2016, Elon Musk ne dirige plus aucun projet d'Hyperloop, mais sa société SpaceX continue d'organiser des compétitions. 
En 2015, il propose (sous la marque Tesla) un système dit « Powerwall » de stockage tampon d'énergie domestique intermittente (ex : solaire et/ou éolienne) via des batteries lithium-ion présentant une bonne efficacité énergétique et bonne durée de vie, acceptant des recharges incomplètes tout en fournissant une tension constante durant toute leur décharge[63]. Ces powerwalls pourront équiper des immeubles et des maisons et, selon Elon Musk, pourraient contribuer à « transformer totalement l'infrastructure énergétique mondiale pour la rendre totalement durable et sans produire d'émissions de carbone ». Chaque bloc accumulateur mesure 130 × 86 × 18 cm et peut accumuler 7 ou 10 kWh, pour une puissance continue de 2 kW (pic à 3,3 kW). Le système peut aussi accumuler de l'énergie achetée en heures creuses ou contribuer à la régulation de fréquence du réseau. Le système permettrait selon lui « de se passer du réseau électrique » y compris dans les pays pauvres, ou d'assurer la consommation électrique durant les coupures de courant. Il compare ce changement à celui du téléphone mobile qui remplace peu à peu les lignes terrestres. Les batteries seront fabriquées par Panasonic dans une « giga-usine (Gigafactory) » de cinq milliards de dollars dans le Nevada, couverte de panneaux solaires et qui sera la plus grande usine de batteries au monde, où il projette de produire un équivalent/stockage de 35 gigawatts-heures d'ici 2020. Les commentateurs posent cependant la question de la ressource en lithium (le Chili et la Chine n'en fournissent en 2015 qu'environ 11 Mt/an avec un prix qui a décuplé entre 2000 et 2010). Tesla sera en outre en concurrence avec d'autres entreprises établies dans le domaine dont LG Chem, AES Energy Storage and NEC/A123, et de nouveaux arrivants dont Enphase, Sunverge Sonnenbatterie et Stem ou Alevo (start-up suisse qui a fait irruption sur la scène en 2014 avec une batterie lithium-ion-soufre garantie 20 ans et un investissement de 1 milliard de dollars dans une usine de fabrication en construction en Caroline du Nord tablant sur un marché de 200 mégawatts-heures de stockage en 2015 et 1 gigawatt-heure en 2016)[64]. D'autres observateurs notent que ces batteries pourront modifier, voire affecter, le secteur de la production d'électricité de pointe et le marché des smartgrids et de la substitution de la « puissance de crête » par le stockage[65]. 
En 2015, il participe à la création du centre de recherche OpenAI sur l’intelligence artificielle ayant pour objectif affiché de « bénéficier à l’humanité »[66]. Il quitte son conseil d'administration en 2018 pour éviter des conflits d'intérêts avec ses autres activités[67]. 
En 2016, il fonde la start-up Neuralink dont l'objectif est de relier le cerveau à des circuits intégrés dans le but de fusionner les intelligences humaines et artificielles[68]. L'implant cérébral sans fil Neuralink devrait dans les faits permettre aux personnes paralysées ou lourdement handicapées de recouvrer la parole et la mobilité[69],[70]. 
Il annonce officiellement en juin 2017 son objectif de commercialisation du premier modèle d’ici 2021[71]. 
Cette commercialisation prend du retard, elle est repoussée à 2022[72], et en février 2022, la société d'Elon Musk confirme que des singes sont morts dans le cadre d'un projet de test de puces cérébrales[73]. 
En décembre 2016, Elon Musk fonde une nouvelle société : « The Boring Company ». Ce projet a pour but de supprimer les bouchons dans les grandes villes par l'installation d'un réseau de voies souterraines. Des ascenseurs positionnés sur la chaussée permettraient de descendre les véhicules dans le réseau souterrain et de les mener à leur destination à une vitesse avoisinant les 200 km/h[74]. 
Les travaux débutent à Los Angeles en mai 2017. 
En janvier 2018, sous prétexte de financement de projet, la société commercialise un lance-flamme-chalumeau, qu'elle nomme ironiquement Not A Flamethrower (« Pas un lance-flamme »)[75]. 
Au printemps 2022, une semaine après avoir demandé à ses abonnés si Twitter protégeait selon eux la liberté d'expression (« La liberté d'expression est nécessaire au bon fonctionnement de la démocratie. Pensez-vous que Twitter respecte scrupuleusement ce principe[76] ? ») et après avoir évoqué la possibilité de créer un réseau concurrent, Elon Musk entre dans le capital de Twitter le 4 avril 2022 en rachetant 9,2 % des actions au prix du marché, devenant ainsi le premier actionnaire du réseau social[77],[78], faisant bondir le cours de l'action d'environ 25 %[79]. Elon Musk avait commencé à acheter des parts de Twitter dès janvier 2022[80]. Dès le lendemain de son acquisition, Musk propose la création d'un bouton « modifier » sur les tweets, proposition qu'il soumet à ses abonnés par un sondage[81]. Le même jour Parag Agrawal, le directeur général de Twitter, annonce l'entrée d'Elon Musk au conseil d'administration de la plateforme, en échange de quoi ce dernier se serait engagé à ne pas augmenter sa participation à plus de 14,9 % du capital[82]. Cependant il est annoncé peu de temps plus tard que le dirigeant de Tesla n'intègrera finalement pas le conseil d'administration de Twitter, sans explications de la part de l'intéressé ou de Twitter[83],[84]. 
Le 14 avril, Elon Musk annonce avoir déposé une offre d'achat de l'ensemble des actions de Twitter au prix de 54,20 dollars l'action[85], soit un prix supérieur à celui du marché et annonçant qu'il s'agit « de sa meilleure offre et de son offre finale »[86]. Il annonce également qu'en cas de refus de son offre par la direction du réseau social il se verrait « contraint » de revoir sa position d'actionnaire. Twitter a annoncé étudier « avec attention » l'offre « non sollicitée et non contraignante d'Elon Musk ». L'offre de Musk est alors unanimement décrite comme une OPA hostile à l'encontre du réseau social[87],[88]. Le 15 avril, la direction de Twitter annonce recourir au mécanisme dite de la « poison pill » afin de protéger son cours en bourse[89]. Avec cette dernière, lorsqu'un actionnaire dépasse le seuil de 15 % d'actions sans l'aval du conseil d'administration, les autres actionnaires pourront acheter des actions à un prix réduit par rapport à celui du marché, diluant ainsi la part de l'activiste indésirable. L'objectif est de ralentir les procédures d'OPA hostile et de permettre au conseil d'administration de gagner du temps afin d'élaborer une contre-stratégie[90]. Cependant la veille, Elon Musk avait affirmé qu'il possédait un « plan B » si Twitter venait à utiliser la « poison pill » avant d'assurer qu'il serait « absolument indéfendable que [son] offre ne soit pas soumis au vote des actionnaires. Ce sont eux qui détiennent l'entreprise, pas le conseil d'administration[91]. » 
Le 25 avril 2022, Elon Musk annonce acheter Twitter pour le prix de 44 milliards de dollars[92],[93]. À l'issue de la transaction, 100 % des parts de Twitter appartiendront au milliardaire qui a déjà annoncé sa volonté de sortir l'entreprise de la cotation en bourse[94],[95]. Connu pour ses convictions libertariennes en se définissant comme un « absolutiste de la liberté d’expression », Elon Musk déclare vouloir racheter l’entreprise au nom de ce principe : « [Elle] est le fondement d’une démocratie qui fonctionne et Twitter est la place publique numérique où sont débattues des questions vitales pour l’avenir de l’humanité »[96]. Il déclare également vouloir davantage de transparence au niveau de l'algorithme en rendant public le code source et « vaincre les robots de spam et authentifier tous les humains »[96]. Après l'annonce du deal, Musk déclare que son premier plan est de rendre open source l'algorithme qui classe les tweets dans le flux, afin d'accroître la transparence du réseau social. Il déclare également son intention de supprimer les comptes automatisés et robots et de mettre en place une procédure permettant « d'authentifier tous les vrais humains » du réseau[97]. Il laisse alors entendre qu'il pourrait transformer le siège de Twitter à San Francisco en un « centre d'hébergement pour sans-abris »[98],[99]. 
Le 4 mai 2022, Musk est convoqué par le Comité du du Numérique, de la Culture, des Médias et du Sport (en) pour discuter de l'effet de son rachat sur la liberté d'expression et les comportements agressifs et délictuels en ligne[100]. Il déclare par la suite qu'il souhaite annuler le bannissement de l'ancien président américain, Donald Trump, du réseau social[101], jugeant qu'il s'agissait d'une « erreur »[102]. Le lendemain, Musk publie le résultat du montage financier prévoyant un financement de 7,1 milliards de dollars, notamment de Larry Ellison, cofondateur d'Oracle Corporation, du prince saoudien Al Walid ben Talal Al Saud, des sociétés de capital-risque Andreessen Horowitz et Sequoia Capital, ainsi que du fonds souverain Qatar Holding[103],[104]. L'injection de capital lui permet de réduire son prêt bancaire personnel initial de moitié, le portant à 6,25 milliards de dollars et de réduire son apport en capital de 21 milliards à un peu moins de 20 milliards de dollars[105],[106]. 
Le 11 mai, le Wall Street Journal rapporte que la Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) et la Federal Trade Commission (FTC) avaient procédé à l'ouverture de plusieurs enquêtes concernant la suite d'événements ayant conduit à l'acquisition de Twitter[107]. Le lendemain, M. Agrawal licencie le directeur général de Twitter, Kayvon Beykpour, et le chef de produit des revenus, Bruce Falck[108]. 
Le 13 mai, Elon Musk déclare que l'accord passé avec Twitter avait été suspendu. Selon lui, cette décision fait suite à l'obtention d'un rapport établissant que 5 % des utilisateurs actifs quotidiens de Twitter étaient des comptes de spam et des bots. Cette déclaration fait rapidement chuter les actions de Twitter de plus de 10 %[109]. Elon Musk affirme alors qu'il reste décidé à acquérir le réseau social[110],[111]. En réponse à un fil Twitter d'Agrawal affirmant qu'un examen externe des utilisateurs de la plateforme était techniquement incommode et probablement impossible à réaliser, Musk publie un emoji caca, suggérant que la communication d'Agrawal relève du « bullshit »[112]. 
Le 17 mai, Musk réitère que l'acquisition ne pourra pas franchir de nouvelle étape tant que Twitter ne pouvait pas prouver que les affirmations relatives aux bots étaient faux. Il demande alors à la Securities and Exchange Commission, la SEC, l'organisme fédéral américain de réglementation et de contrôle des marchés financiers, d'enquêter sur le nombre d'utilisateurs quotidiens de Twitter[113],[114]. Le même jour, Twitter dépose de nouveaux documents auprès de la SEC[115], y compris une chronologie détaillée de l'acquisition par Musk et a affirmé qu'elle ""appliquerait l'accord de fusion"" quelles que soient les actions de Musk[116]. 
Le 25 mai, Musk déclare abandonner son projet de financer partiellement l'opération de rachat par le biais de prêts sur marge contre des actions Tesla, choisissant plutôt de s'engager à verser 6,25 milliards de dollars supplémentaires en financement par actions[117],[118]. Le même jour, William Heresniak, un investisseur de Twitter, dépose un recours collectif contre Elon Musk, alléguant du viol des lois sur les sociétés en Californie en manipulant le marché[119]. 
Le 3 juin, le rachat de Twitter est approuvé par l'autorité de surveillance de la concurrence et de monopoles américaine[120]. Dans un courriel envoyé par l'avocat de Musk à Twitter trois jours plus tard, Musk menace cependant à nouveau de mettre fin à son accord avec Twitter en raison du refus de la société de communiquer les données relatives à sa base d'utilisateurs[121],[122]. Twitter répond alors que le réseau et l'entreprise continueraient à coopérer avec Musk pour s'assurer que la transaction soit conclue conformément à leur accord[123]. 
Le 8 juin, le conseil d'administration de Twitter plie aux exigences de Musk, acceptant de lui fournir un flux de données de tweets[124],[125]. Musk participe à une réunion générale le 16 juin pour répondre aux questions des employés de Twitter[126]. Il y aborde sa vision de la politique de modération du contenu de Twitter, la liberté d'expression, les licenciements potentiels, le télétravail et « la nature cosmique de Twitter »[127],[128],[129]. Musk exprime à cette occasion son souhait que Twitter atteigne un milliard d'utilisateurs actifs[130]. Lors d'une conférence le 7 juillet, Twitter révèle que plus d'un million de comptes de spam étaient supprimés chaque jour[131] et réaffirme qu'il demeure impossible de déterminer par des moyens externes le nombre exact de ces comptes, car cela impliquerait de révéler un ensemble de données privées sur les utilisateurs. Le même jour, le Washington Post indique que l'accord avec Musk était « en péril » en raison d'un ralentissement des discussions sur le financement. 
Musk annonce finalement son intention de mettre fin à l'accord de rachat le 8 juillet, affirmant que Twitter avait violé leur accord initial en refusant de sévir contre les comptes robotisés dédiés au spam[132],[133]. Twitter intente alors une action en justice contre Musk devant la Cour des comptes du Delaware, le 12 juillet. Le procès se tient à partir du 17 octobre 2022[134]. 
Menacé par le procès, Elon Musk annonce finalement réintroduire une proposition d'achat avec un prix inchangé. La vente est finalisée dans la nuit du 27 octobre au 28 octobre. Sitôt devenu propriétaire du réseau social, Musk licencie le directeur général Parag Agrawal, le directeur financier Ned Segal et la directrice des affaires juridiques et politiques Vijaya Gadde[135]. 
Le 20 décembre 2022, Elon Musk annonce quitter son poste de PDG de Twitter dès qu'il aura trouvé quelqu'un pour lui succéder[136]. Il est finalement remplacé par Linda Yaccarino le 11 mai 2023, mais souhaite rester à l'initiative des changements techniques apportés au réseau social[137]. 
En mars 2023, il fonde la société xAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) dans le domaine de l'intelligence artificielle, en vue de concurrencer Microsoft, Google et OpenAI dans ce secteur[138]. 
La méthode de travail d’Elon Musk pour innover et provoquer des ruptures technologiques est de revenir aux principes premiers, aux fondamentaux de la physique, en ce sens que la physique seule dicte ce qu’il est possible de faire ou non[139]. Sur la base de ce qui est physiquement faisable, Elon Musk vise ensuite toujours le moindre coût possible pour tenter des économies d’un ou plusieurs ordres de grandeur. 
L’approche d’Elon Musk est également de favoriser les essais, même infructueux, pour développer par itération (en) plutôt que de tout concevoir en une fois en visant la réussite du premier coup[140]. 
Elon Musk cherche aussi à ne pas trop optimiser mais plutôt à éliminer : selon lui, la pire chose à faire est de chercher à optimiser un mécanisme qui ne devrait tout simplement même pas exister à la base (« si vous ne rajoutez pas au moins 10 % de ce que vous avez supprimé, c’est que vous ne supprimez pas assez »)[141]. C’est par exemple ainsi que SpaceX a supprimé le système de propulsion de SuperHeavy pour son repositionnement après séparation du Starship par un simple système de dégazage. 
Enfin, Elon Musk prône l'intégration verticale, qui consiste à intégrer un maximum de compétences en interne pour maîtriser le maximum de choses sans dépendre de sous-traitants, de leurs délais, de leurs difficultés[142]. SpaceX fabrique par exemple ses propres cartes-mères et circuits intégrés[54]. 
Fin 2016, il devient conseiller du président des États-Unis Donald Trump ; il abandonne son poste en juin 2017 lorsque Donald Trump annonce son intention de quitter l'accord de Paris sur le climat[143]. 
Elon Musk signe en 2017, avec une centaine de responsables d'entreprises spécialisées dans l'intelligence artificielle ou la robotique, une lettre ouverte aux Nations unies mettant en garde contre les dangers des armes autonomes, surnommées robots tueurs[144]. 
En 2018, ses donations de 88 900 $ au Parti républicain sont révélés par le Huffington Post[145]. 
À partir de 2022, il critique régulièrement la politique du président Joe Biden ainsi que son âge (78 ans le jour de son entrée en fonction) pour l'exercice du pouvoir présidentiel en déclarant « Il existe déjà des conditions d’âge minimum pour la Chambre, le Sénat et la présidence. Réciproquement, il devrait y avoir aussi des limites d’âge maximum »[146]. D'une manière globale, il déplore la gérontocratie en ajoutant « Je pense que nous avons déjà un problème assez sérieux avec la gérontocratie, où les dirigeants de tant de pays sont extrêmement âgés. Pour qu’une démocratie fonctionne, les dirigeants doivent être en contact avec la majorité de la population »[147]. 
En novembre 2022, Musk appelle les électeurs américains à voter pour le Parti républicain lors des élections de mi-mandat, afin de garantir l'équilibre entre les pouvoirs exécutif et législatif[148]. Il rétablit le compte Twitter de l'ancien président américain Donald Trump suite à un sondage qu'il lance auprès des utilisateurs de la plateforme. Il soutient cependant la candidature de Ron DeSantis contre Donald Trump pour les primaires du Parti républicain en vue de l'élection présidentielle américaine de 2024[149]. En mai 2023, Ron DeSantis annonce sa candidature sur Twitter et échange à cette occasion avec Elon Musk dans une discussion audio en direct sur ce réseau social[150]. 
En mars 2023, il soutient l'activiste d'extrême droite Jake Angeli, emprisonné pour sa participation à l'assaut du Capitole, et appelle à sa libération[151]. 
Il publie un message de soutien au milliardaire Vivek Ramaswamy lors des primaires du Parti républicain américain de 2024. Ce dernier se présente notamment comme le « candidat anti-woke » et fait campagne sur un programme conservateur et climatosceptique[152]. 
Il s'affirme « pro-immigration » et rappelle en être lui-même issu. Il appelle ainsi à assouplir la politique migratoire des États-Unis[153]. 
Soucieux de l'avenir de l'intelligence artificielle, il est membre de l'association Future of Life Institute. Craignant que les robots puissent un jour supplanter et nuire à l'humanité[154], Elon Musk tente de développer des initiatives afin de réfléchir à l'avenir de la robotique[155]. 
Du 29 au 31 août 2019, il assiste à la WAIC (World Artificial Intelligence Conference). Jack Ma, homme d'affaires chinois et président d'Alibaba Group et Elon Musk se sont rencontrés et ont débattu sur le sujet de l'intelligence artificielle pour savoir si elle représente un danger et si elle peut nous dépasser[156]. 
Elon Musk imagine un scénario où l'intelligence artificielle rendra les emplois obsolètes. Il affirme : « Le dernier travail qui restera probablement consistera à écrire un logiciel d'intelligence artificielle. Ensuite, l'intelligence artificielle finira par écrire son propre logiciel. » Pour lui, les machines risquent de surpasser l'Homme, car la technologie évolue rapidement ; « Les ordinateurs sont déjà beaucoup plus intelligents que les humains sous de nombreux aspects », dit-il. Selon lui, les machines risquent de s'impatienter face à la lenteur cérébrale des humains et elles pourraient nous considérer comme des êtres lents et stupides ; « ce serait comme parler à un arbre » rajoute-t-il[156]. 
En 2023, il est co-signataire d'une pétition appelant à un moratoire sur l'intelligence artificielle en attendant la mise en place de systèmes de sécurité[157]. En novembre, il déclare à Sky News que l'IA présente un « risque » pour l'humanité[158]. 
Musk est généralement présenté comme non croyant, mais il a plusieurs fois déclaré croire, comme Einstein au Dieu de Spinoza[159], une expression qui fait référence à la conception de Dieu du philosophe néerlandais Baruch Spinoza telle que présentée dans son ouvrage majeur, l'Éthique. Spinoza y rejette la conception traditionnelle de Dieu comme personne transcendante qui crée et gouverne l'univers. Au lieu de cela, il a conçu Dieu comme une substance immanente, qui est la cause et la substance de tout ce qui existe. 
Le 21 juillet 2021, Elon Musk déclare qu'il était pro-nucléaire, précisant ensuite : « L'énergie nucléaire a toute sa place dans des pays bénéficiant d'un environnement naturel stable »[160]. 
Adepte du courant libertarien, il est hostile à l'existence de syndicats dans les entreprises[146]. En novembre 2021, il accueille très froidement la proposition de Bernie Sanders d'augmenter la taxation des grandes fortunes[161]. 
En août 2022, dans un entretien accordé à la presse norvégienne, il se dit inquiet de la baisse de la natalité qui pourrait selon lui faire disparaître notre civilisation[162]. 
Sur le réseau social Twitter dont il est propriétaire, le milliardaire Elon Musk réagit aux manifestations contre le projet de contre-réforme des retraites, en marquant son soutien au projet, le 18 mars 2023, déclarant que « l'âge de la retraite en France est trop bas », ce qui pose selon lui « un vrai problème »[163]. 
En octobre 2023, il prend la défense du polémiste d'extrême droite franco-suisse Alain Soral dans le cadre de sa condamnation en Suisse pour des propos homophobes visant une journaliste suisse, estimant que ceux-ci ne devraient pas être un délit pénal[164],[165],[166]. Le même mois, il relaie des accusations selon lesquelles des ONG allemandes collecteraient des migrants clandestins en mer Méditerranée pour les débarquer en Italie avec le soutien financier du gouvernement allemand, remet en cause cette initiative et exprime des préoccupations concernant la souveraineté italienne. Ces accusations sont cependant réfutées études à l'appui par SOS Méditerranée, ainsi que par les propos du ministre de l'Intérieur italien Matteo Piantedosi[167]. 
À la suite de l'invasion de l'Ukraine par la Russie en 2022, il défie personnellement le président Vladimir Poutine à travers un tweet en lui proposant « un combat d'homme à homme »[168]. En guise de réponse, le président tchétchène, Ramzan Kadyrov à travers son compte Telegram lui suggère que le combat n'est pas équitable et l'invite à s'entrainer dans des centres en République de Tchétchénie en lui indiquant « Ici, nous t'en dirons plus sur tes obscures méthodes américaines de RP (relations publiques, NDLR) et nous t'apprendrons à bien tenir tes comptes sur les réseaux sociaux. Tu quitteras la Tchétchénie en te sentant une toute nouvelle personne »[169]. 
Fin février 2022, le vice-Premier ministre ukrainien, Mykhaïlo Fedorov, interpelle directement Elon Musk en lui demandant une assistance satellitaire pour maintenir les services de communication, ce qu'Elon Musk accepte en lui envoyant des stations internet Starlink afin d'aider le pays à rester connecté malgré l'offensive russe[170]. En octobre 2022, il déclare que SpaceX ne peut pas « financer indéfiniment le système » Starlink et demande une participation de plusieurs dizaines de millions de dollars de la part du gouvernement américain[171],[172]. Durant l'année 2022, au cours d'une attaque de drones lancés par des sous-marins ukrainiens et utilisant l'infrastructure Starlink, Elon Musk ordonne secrètement à ses ingénieurs de désactiver les communications de son réseau au-dessus de la côte de Crimée. Cette décision cause l'échec de l'attaque ukrainienne. Musk justifie cette décision par sa peur de représailles nucléaires de la Russie, développée après des discussions avec des représentants russes[173]. 
En octobre 2022, Musk suggère un sondage en ligne sur Twitter dans la perspective d’accord de paix entre la Russie et l'Ukraine, sur la base de nouveaux référendums sous l’égide de l'Organisation des Nations unies (ONU) (mais vidées de facto de leur population ukrainienne d’avant l’occupation russe) dans les territoires occupés, d'un statut de neutralité pour l'Ukraine et surtout d’un rattachement de facto de la Crimée (territoire ukrainien annexé de force par la Russie) à cette même Russie[174]. Des responsables ukrainiens ont vivement réagi, dont l'ambassadeur d'Ukraine en Allemagne, lui répondant : « Ma réponse très diplomatique est d'aller vous faire foutre »[175] ainsi que le président Volodymyr Zelensky qui riposte avec un autre sondage invitant les utilisateurs à prendre parti entre l'Ukraine et la Russie[170]. 
En janvier 2018, Tesla annonce la proposition de compensation pour Elon Musk à son poste de PDG de l'entreprise pour les dix années à venir. Il sera compensé exclusivement en fonction des performances de son entreprise : aucun salaire fixe et la presque totalité de ses revenus liée à l'atteinte des objectifs opérationnels et à l'évolution du cours en bourse[176],[177]. Ce plan de compensation est adopté par un vote des actionnaires en mars 2018 avec 73 % de support de la part des actionnaires en excluant les votes d'Elon Musk et de son frère Kimbal Musk, et environ 80 % au total, soit moins que les 95 % d'approbations typiquement exprimées lors de votes des actionnaires sur le salaire des dirigeants de grosses entreprises américaines[178]. 
En janvier 2021, selon Bloomberg, Elon Musk devient à 49 ans l'homme le plus riche du monde, à la suite d'une envolée boursière à l'ouverture de Wall Street. Avec une fortune estimée à plus de 188,5 milliards de dollars, il devance Jeff Bezos d'1,5 milliard de dollars[188]. 
L'essentiel de cette fortune est néanmoins composée en très grande majorité d'actions Tesla et SpaceX. En effet, ces dernières représentent environ 99% de sa fortune selon une estimation de Forbes[189]. 
Les tweets d'Elon Musk ont parfois un impact direct sur la bourse. Le 26 janvier, il a publié sur le réseau social un tweet mentionnant qu'il est intéressé par le site de vente en ligne Etsy. Le cours de l'action a monté de 18 % à la suite de cette publication[190]. De même, à nouveau sur Twitter, il recommande l’application de messagerie Signal, ce qui est à l'origine de l'augmentation de la cotation boursière de l'entreprise Signal Avancé qui n’a aucun lien[191]. 
En juin 2021, selon Forbes, Elon Musk serait le 3e homme le plus riche du monde, après Jeff Bezos et Bernard Arnault, notamment grâce au succès des véhicules produits par sa marque automobile Tesla et du cours de ses actions qui ont multiplié sa fortune professionnelle par six[192]. 
En février 2023, il est l'homme le plus riche du monde selon Ouest-France[193]. Il est classé deuxième en mai 2023 derrière Bernard Arnault qui est classé premier avec 238,5 milliards de dollars par Forbes au 9 mai 2023[194], puis le dépasse en juin 2023[195]. 
Selon Jon Favreau, réalisateur des films Iron Man, Elon Musk est l'inspiration du personnage de Tony Stark joué par Robert Downey Jr.[16]. 
Il apparaît en 2015 dans un épisode de la série télévisée The Big Bang Theory (saison 9, épisode 9) et en 2017 dans son spin-off Young Sheldon (saison 1, épisode 6), ainsi que dans la série d'animation Les Simpsons (saison 26, épisode 12). Il fait aussi une courte apparition dans le film Machete Kills où il joue son propre rôle[198] ainsi que dans le film Iron Man 2 où, lors d'un bref cameo, il fait part à Tony Stark d'un projet d'avion électrique[199]. Il fait également une apparition dans The Boyfriend : Pourquoi lui ?, aux côtés de Bryan Cranston et James Franco[200]. 
Il est cité dans l'épisode 3 de Star Trek: Discovery avec les frères Wright et Zefram Cochrane. Il apparaît dans la série-documentaire Mars à travers des commentaires scientifiques et des images de lancement de fusées.[réf. nécessaire] 
En février 2019, il présente l'émission Meme Review du youtubeur Pewdiepie en duo avec l'acteur Justin Roiland, à la suite de nombreuses demandes de la part des internautes.[réf. nécessaire] 
En juillet 2018, Elon Musk propose d'aider les autorités thaïlandaises en construisant dans l'urgence et en quelques jours un mini-sous-marin conçu à partir d’un morceau de fusée[201] pour évacuer quatre des jeunes encore coincés parmi les douze dans une grotte inondée, les autres ayant déjà été évacués[201]. Le fondateur de SpaceX s’est même déplacé jusqu’en Thaïlande pour livrer le sous-marin aux équipes de sauvetage. Cependant, le responsable de l’opération de sauvetage a déclaré à la BBC : « Même si leur équipement est très sophistiqué technologiquement parlant, il ne correspond pas aux besoins de notre mission dans le système de grottes », il ne sera donc pas utilisé[201]. Un spéléologue britannique ayant contribué au sauvetage des douze enfants et de leur entraîneur de football coincés dans cette grotte, Vernon Unsworth, écrit sur Twitter à Elon Musk qu'il pouvait se mettre son sous-marin « là où ça fait mal », qualifiant son offre d'aide de « coup de pub ». Elon Musk rétorque qu'il pariait que ce spéléologue britannique était pédophile[202]. Une action en justice est envisagée par Vernon Unsworth, et les actions de Tesla chutent de 3 %[203]. Elon Musk présente par la suite ses excuses. Attaqué en justice, il est relaxé[204]. 
En septembre 2018, le gendarme de la Bourse américaine, la Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), annonce poursuivre Elon Musk en justice[205]. La SEC accuse Elon Musk d'avoir trompé les investisseurs, avec un tweet publié le 7 août 2018, dans lequel il avait affirmé : « J'envisage de retirer Tesla de la bourse à 420 dollars (par action). Financement assuré. » Il n’en était rien et aucun financement n’avait été prévu pour cette opération estimée à plusieurs dizaines de milliards de dollars, contrairement à ce qu'avait prétendu Elon Musk. Le groupe avait finalement abandonné cette idée quelque temps après et l'action avait perdu jusqu'à 30 % de sa valeur. Dans sa plainte, la SEC demande notamment à Elon Musk de ne plus diriger l'entreprise cotée en Bourse. Cependant, après un accord à l'amiable[206] conclu le 30 septembre 2018, Elon Musk accepte de démissionner du poste de président du conseil d'administration de Tesla. Il conserve toutefois la direction des opérations du constructeur automobile et reste membre du conseil d'administration, mais il devra nommer deux directeurs indépendants au conseil d'administration, être remplacé au poste de président du conseil d'administration et payer une amende de 20 millions de dollars (soit 17 millions d'euros)[207]. Tesla devra aussi payer une amende de 20 millions de dollars (Elon Musk achètera directement à Tesla des parts pour la même somme en novembre 2018, ce qui apparaît comme une compensation pour que les conséquences de cette sanction ne pèsent pas sur les résultats financiers de l'entreprise)[208],[209]. L'accord prévoit également d'introduire pour Elon Musk des restrictions sur sa communication (y compris sur les réseaux sociaux) lorsqu'elle contient, ou pourrait raisonnablement contenir, des informations importantes pour l'entreprise ou ses actionnaires afin qu'elles soient préapprouvées. L'accord est approuvé par le tribunal le 16 octobre 2018[210]. 
Sans pouvoir l’accuser de manipulation de cours, parce que les bitcoins ne sont pas considérés comme des titres comme les actions, Elon Musk est critiqué par la SEC pour sa spéculation sur cette cryptomonnaie. Celui-ci en effet achète des bitcoins par l’intermédiaire de Tesla, puis fait monter le cours en disant qu’il acceptera cette devise pour payer ses automobiles, avant de tourner casaque en communiquant sur le fait que le bitcoin consomme de l’énergie (et donc pollue), pour s’enrichir en achetant et en vendant à contre-courant du yoyo du cours qu’il provoque lui-même[211],[212]. Musk aurait fait de même avec le meme coin Dogecoin. 
Après une série de tweets qu'Elon Musk a publiés sur son compte Twitter le 19 février 2019, la SEC a saisi le tribunal fédéral du district sud de l'État de New York pour avoir, selon elle, enfreint les termes de l'accord à l'amiable qu'ils avaient conclu le 30 septembre 2018[213]. Le premier tweet cité par la SEC a été publié à 19 h 45 heure de l'Est et indiquait que « Tesla avait produit 0 voiture en 2011, mais en produira environ 500 000 en 2019 »[214]. Le second tweet publié à 23 h 41 heure de l'Est cité dans la plainte était un tweet en réponse à celui de 19 h 45 où Elon Musk clarifiait l'information de son précédent tweet : « Je voulais dire un taux de production annualisé à la fin de l'année 2019 probablement autour de 500 000, c'est-à-dire 10 000 voitures/semaine. Les ventes pour l'année sont toujours estimées à 400 000 »[214]. Le 20 février 2019, la SEC a donc demandé à Elon Musk et à Tesla si les deux tweets en question avaient été préapprouvés par le directeur juridique, comme le prévoyait le nouveau règlement interne. Dans sa réponse au nom de Tesla et d'Elon Musk, son avocat a confirmé que le premier tweet de 19 h 45 n'avait pas été préapprouvé. Le conseiller juridique des marchés aurait arrangé une réunion a posteriori avec Elon Musk pour évaluer ce tweet et rédiger un tweet correctif (le second tweet de 23 h 41). Le nouveau règlement en place pour les dirigeants de l'entreprise prévoit notamment que toute communication écrite qui contiendrait une information importante pour Tesla ou ses actionnaires doit être préapprouvée. Si un dirigeant veut modifier une déclaration ou publier des informations importantes plus de deux jours après avoir reçu l'autorisation de publier ces informations, la demande doit être renouvelée par écrit pour avoir une nouvelle autorisation. Elon Musk a indiqué à la SEC qu'il ne pensait pas que son tweet de 19 h 45 requérait une autorisation préalable parce qu'il ne faisait que récapituler des informations publiques qui avaient déjà été approuvées 20 jours plus tôt le 30 janvier 2019 lors de la publication par Tesla de ses résultats financiers du quatrième semestre et de l'année complète 2018 ainsi que la conférence téléphonique qui a suivi. 
Lors de la pandémie de Covid-19, Elon Musk est critiqué pour ses commentaires publics et sa conduite liés à la pandémie de Covid-19[215],[216]. Il diffuse des informations erronées sur le virus, notamment en faisant la promotion d'un article scientifique largement discrédité sur les avantages de la chloroquine et en affirmant que les statistiques de décès liées au Covid-19 étaient gonflées[217]. 
Il exige que ses salariés viennent travailler au bureau plutôt que de télétravailler[218],[219]. Il leur écrit pour affirmer qu'ils ont « plus de chances de mourir dans un accident de la route que du coronavirus », après avoir publié un message sur les réseaux sociaux affirmant que « cette panique autour du coronavirus est débile ». Le bureau du shérif du comté d'Alameda (Californie) est finalement intervenu pour demander aux usines Tesla de respecter les mesures de confinement, alors qu'elles demandaient à leurs salariés de continuer à venir sur place[220]. 
Après la crise post-électorale bolivienne de 2019, le 31 mars 2020, la nouvelle ministre des Affaires étrangères de Bolivie, Karen Longaric écrit à Elon Musk « toute société que vous ou votre entreprise pouvez fournir à notre pays sera la bienvenue ».
(« any corporation that you or your company can provide to our country will be gratefully welcomed. »[221]). Le lithium est un métal indispensable à la fabrication de batteries, nécessaires au fonctionnement des automobiles de Tesla, comme dans toute voiture électrique, équipement informatique ou industriel reposant sur des batteries, dont un important gisement est situé dans le Salar d'Uyuni, en Bolivie (première réserve mondiale)[221]. En 2020, en réponse à un tweet accusant le gouvernement américain d'avoir organisé un coup d'État contre le président Evo Morales, Elon Musk répond par « Nous ferons un coup d'État contre qui nous voulons ! Faites avec. » (« We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it. »)[221],[222]. 
D'après une information de Business Insider, Elon Musk a été accusé de harcèlement sexuel par une hôtesse de l'air pour des faits survenus lors d'un vol privé en 2016. Selon le site d'information, l'hôtesse de l'air s'est également plainte d'avoir moins de travail qu'auparavant en conséquence de son refus des avances sexuelles d'Elon Musk. En 2018, l'entreprise SpaceX d'Elon Musk propose à cette hôtesse de l'air une somme de 250 000 dollars afin de régler l'affaire à l'amiable[223]. Suivant la révélation de ces informations par Business Insider, Elon Musk prétend qu'il serait victime de « coups bas » de la part du Parti démocrate à la suite de sa prise de position en faveur du Parti républicain, et nie l'accusation de harcèlement sexuel[224]. 
Elon Musk se déclarant engagé dans la lutte contre le réchauffement climatique, fait polémique avec son empreinte carbone. Le développement du flight tracking met en avant les nombreux déplacements en jet privé de plusieurs personnalités fortunées, dont il fait partie, ce qui les dérange[225],[226],[227]. Il propose 5 000 dollars au fondateur du compte Twitter « ElonJet » pour qu’il arrête de publier des informations sur ses trajets en jet[228],[229]. 
En 2023, Elon Musk et Mark Zuckerberg annoncent vouloir disputer un match en cage, dont la date n'est pas encore fixée[230],[231]. 
En octobre 2023, Elon Musk s'en prend publiquement à la Fondation Wikimédia et à son projet le plus connu, Wikipédia qu’il accuse de servir un agenda politique « au service du wokisme ». Cette attaque voit le jour en réaction aux critiques du co-fondateur de Wikipédia, Jimmy Wales, qui dénonce les changements introduits sur Twitter / X, qui empêchent selon lui de « distinguer un vrai journaliste d'un faux », en raison de la certification payante accordant un crédit de façade à quiconque paye le service[232], facilitant la diffusion de fausses informations sur le réseau[232]. Elon Musk se plaint, dans le même temps, que la page lui étant consacrée liste les scandales qui le visent[233]. Il accuse aussi Wikipédia de chercher à lever constamment de nouveaux fonds, dont il suggère que la destination est suspecte ou trompeuse[232], affirmant que l'intégralité de l'encyclopédie pourrait tenir sur un téléphone. Il propose ainsi de faire un don d'un milliard de dollars à la fondation en échange du renommage de l'encyclopédie en « Dickipedia » (dick signifiant pénis dans le registre familier anglais)[232]. La passe d'armes provoque un tollé dans la presse anglophone, qui accuse Elon Musk de rejeter « une expérience démocratique dédiée à la connaissance », ajoutant qu'il « préfère hurler des « blagues » puériles dans l'éther[234]. » Selon la journaliste du Guardian Zoe Williams (en), outre le dédain lié aux critiques dont il est en particulier l'objet, Elon Musk s'en prend à Wikipédia car « la vue de quelque chose créé socialement et qui fonctionne est une insulte pour lui[234]. »  "

Musk ha affermato che l'obiettivo di Tesla e SpaceX si concentra sull'ideale di migliorare il mondo e l'umanità.[8] Uno dei suoi scopi è anche quello di ridurre il riscaldamento globale tramite l'utilizzo di energie rinnovabili e ridurre il rischio dell'estinzione umana o di catastrofi naturali stabilendo una colonia umana su Marte.[9] Tramite Starlink, una costellazione di satelliti prodotta e gestita da SpaceX, vorrebbe invece fornire Internet ad alta velocità e bassa latenza a tutto il pianeta.[10]

Elon Musk è nato il 28 giugno 1971 a Pretoria, in Sudafrica,[13] da Maye Haldeman ed Errol Musk.[14][15] La madre è una dietologa e modella canadese,[16] mentre il padre è un ingegnere elettromeccanico, pilota e navigatore sudafricano, ex co-proprietario di una miniera di smeraldi in Zambia.[17][14] Ha un fratello, Kimbal, del 1972, e una sorella, Tosca, del 1974.[18][19][20] La nonna paterna era britannica,[20] mentre il nonno materno era statunitense, del Minnesota.[21] Dopo il divorzio dei suoi genitori nel 1980 Musk ha vissuto principalmente con il padre in Sudafrica, ma ora afferma di aver fatto un grave errore ad aver scelto il padre, soprattutto poiché questi era indifferente verso il bullismo subito dal figlio; infatti da adulto ha poi tagliato i rapporti con lui.[22] 
Durante l'infanzia, Musk era un grande lettore;[23] e all'età di 10 anni si appassiona alla programmazione, che impara da solo utilizzando un Commodore VIC-20;[24] a 12 anni vende il codice da lui creato di un videogioco scritto in BASIC, chiamato Blastar, alla rivista chiamata PC and Office Technology per circa 500 US $. Una versione web del gioco[25] esiste tuttora online.[26] 
Musk è stato vittima di bullismo per tutta la sua infanzia,[22] ed è finito all'ospedale quando un gruppo di ragazzi l'ha lanciato giù da una rampa di scale per poi picchiarlo fino a fargli perdere conoscenza.[22][23] 
Musk ha studiato dapprima in scuole private, frequentando la Waterkloof House Preparatory School inglese e la Bryanston High School;[27] si è successivamente diplomato alla Pretoria Boys High School. Sebbene il padre avesse insistito affinché andasse in college a Pretoria, Elon era determinato a trasferirsi negli Stati Uniti. Come afferma: ""Ricordo che pensavo e vedevo che l'America è dove sono possibili grandi cose, più di ogni altra nazione nel mondo.""[28] Sapendo che era facile arrivare negli Stati Uniti dal Canada, vi si trasferì nel giugno del 1989, non ancora diciottenne, dopo aver ottenuto la cittadinanza tramite la madre.[29][30] 
All'età di 19 anni, Musk viene accettato alla Queen's University a Kingston, Ontario. Nel 1992, dopo 2 anni alla Queen's University, si trasferisce all'Università della Pennsylvania, dove consegue dapprima un Bachelor of Science in economia, presso la Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, e poi un Bachelor of Arts in fisica al College of Arts and Sciences.[31][32] 
Nel 1995, all'età di 24 anni, Musk si trasferisce in California per iniziare un dottorato in fisica applicata e scienza dei materiali alla Stanford University, ma si ritirò dopo 2 giorni per inseguire le sue aspirazioni imprenditoriali nelle aree di internet, energia rinnovabile ed esplorazione dello spazio.[33][34] Nel 2002, è diventato cittadino degli USA. 
Nel 1995, Elon Musk e suo fratello Kimbal Musk fondarono Zip2, un'azienda di software web, con il denaro raccolto da un piccolo gruppo di angel investor.[22] L'azienda sviluppava e vendeva guide cittadine online per l'industria editoriale di giornali.[35] Musk ottenne dei contratti con The New York Times e il Chicago Tribune[36] e convinse il consiglio di amministrazione a non pianificare un'unione con CitySearch.[37] Mentre era in Zip2, Musk voleva diventare CEO, ma nessun membro del consiglio lo permetteva.[23] Compaq acquisì Zip2 per 307 milioni di $ in denaro[23] e 34 milioni in stock option nel febbraio del 1999.[38] Dalla vendita Musk ricevette 22 milioni di $ per la sua parte del 70%.[23][36] 
Nel marzo 1999 Musk investe il ricavato della vendita di Zip2 a Compaq per cofondare X.com, una compagnia di servizi finanziari online e di pagamenti via e-mail. Un anno dopo, la compagnia si fonde con Confinity, dando origine a PayPal. Quando questa viene acquistata da eBay nel 2002 per 1,5 miliardi di dollari, Elon Musk diventa uno degli imprenditori più conosciuti al mondo. 
Nel giugno 2002 Musk fonda la sua terza compagnia: Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, nota come SpaceX, di cui è CEO e CTO.[39] 
Fin dal primo giorno, l'obiettivo di SpaceX è quello di sviluppare un'architettura per il trasporto interplanetario di massa completamente riutilizzabile. Lo sviluppo di tale architettura, chiamata inizialmente BFR, è iniziato internamente nel 2014, venendo presentato pubblicamente all'International Astronautical Congress del 2016. Attualmente l'architettura è in sviluppo, con diversi prototipi di base già all'attivo, sotto il nome di Starship, presso Boca Chica TX, sito dove SpaceX sta costruendo le infrastrutture necessarie per produrre, testare e lanciare il veicolo. 
SpaceX non è solo impegnata nello sviluppo interno dell'architettura Starship, ma si occupa anche del rifornimento della Stazione Spaziale Internazionale per conto della NASA (programma CRS) tramite il lanciatore Falcon 9 e la capsula Dragon, nonché del lancio di satelliti per conto di privati, tramite Falcon 9 e Falcon Heavy. 
Nel 2004 entra a far parte di Tesla, una multinazionale produttrice di veicoli elettrici e di pannelli solari, che diventa presto la sua attività più importante, di cui è tuttora CEO e product architect. 
La missione di Tesla è accelerare la transizione del mondo verso energie sostenibili tramite la produzione ed il consumo delle stesse attraverso energie rinnovabili e veicoli elettrici, rispettivamente.[40] 
Il suo interesse verso i veicoli elettrici è radicato da ben prima della fondazione di Tesla. Tutto ebbe inizio quando Musk assunse come amministratore delegato Martin Eberhard, fornendo praticamente tutto il capitale per le prime due raccolte fondi della società e divenendone, fin dall'inizio, azionista di maggioranza. A causa della crisi finanziaria del 2008, con conseguenti licenziamenti nell'azienda Tesla, Musk fu costretto ad assumere anche la carica di amministratore delegato. 
La prima automobile elettrica a essere stata costruita da Tesla, all'epoca Tesla Motors, è stata la Tesla Roadster, un modello sportivo. La Tesla Roadster è stata commercializzata in 31 paesi, per un totale di 2 500 esemplari venduti. Tesla ha poi iniziato le consegne della berlina a quattro porte Model S il 22 giugno 2012 dopo aver svelato, il 9 febbraio 2012, il terzo prodotto dell'azienda: la Tesla Model X. La Model X si presenta come un SUV e la sua commercializzazione è iniziata a settembre del 2015, dopo numerosi rinvii dovuti a problemi tecnici. 
Il 31 marzo 2016 è stata presentata la berlina Tesla Model 3. Si tratta del primo modello della casa che aspira a un pubblico più vasto, visto il prezzo base annunciato di 35000 $ (tasse escluse). L'avvio della produzione a luglio 2017 è stato sancito da Musk con la frase, rivolta ai dipendenti di Tesla, ""Welcome to production hell"" (Benvenuti all'inferno della produzione)[41], riferendosi allo stress sulla compagnia che la produzione della Model 3 avrebbe portato, essendo la prima Tesla prodotta su larga scala. Inizialmente la produzione ha visto numerosi ritardi, che hanno portato a una crescente attenzione dei media sul numero di Model 3 prodotte.[42] A luglio 2018 Tesla ha raggiunto l'obiettivo auto-imposto di 5000 Tesla Model 3 prodotte alla settimana,[43] un primo segnale positivo circa la risoluzione dei problemi produttivi. Nel 2020 entra in produzione la Tesla Model Y, un SUV di design derivato dalla Model 3. 
Nel dicembre del 2017 Tesla svela al pubblico il Tesla Semi, un camion elettrico. Durante la stessa presentazione viene svelata al pubblico la nuova Tesla Roadster[44].
Il Tesla Semi è entrato in produzione pilota nel quarto trimestre del 2022 [45]. 
Nel 2006 ispirò la creazione di SolarCity, una compagnia specializzata in prodotti e servizi legati al fotovoltaico che diventò successivamente sussidiaria di Tesla. Oltre ad essere l'investitore principale, Elon Musk opera come presidente del consiglio di amministrazione di SolarCity. 
L'amministratore delegato nonché cofondatore di questa impresa è il cugino di Musk, Lyndon Rive.[46][47] Così come per Tesla, il motivo di fondo che ha spinto Musk a finanziare questa compagnia è la lotta al riscaldamento globale.[48] SolarCity è cresciuta molto negli ultimi anni grazie a diversi finanziamenti da aziende private e il continuo sviluppo del solare. La compagnia è stata successivamente assorbita da Tesla verso la fine del 2016.[49] 
Hyperloop è un sistema futuristico di trasporto ad alta velocità ideato da Elon Musk. Secondo Musk esso rappresenterebbe una ""quinta modalità"" di trasporto, alternativa a navi, aerei, automobili e treni, aggiungendo che ""potrebbe rivoluzionare i viaggi"". 
Musk e un piccolo gruppo di ingegneri di Tesla e SpaceX hanno pubblicato un progetto preliminare ad agosto 2013. Il progetto ""Alpha"" richiede una capsula che dovrebbe essere posizionata su un cuscino d'aria forzata attraverso molteplici aperture sul fondo della capsula. Il progetto propone ""una combinazione di mezzi attivi e passivi per ridurre gli effetti negativi della resistenza dell'aria"". Secondo tale progetto un Hyperloop potrebbe consentire di collegare Los Angeles e San Francisco in 35 minuti. La proposta ""Alpha"" verrebbe a costare 6 miliardi di dollari, mentre una versione che permette il trasporto di passeggeri e auto costerebbe 7,5 miliardi di dollari.[50] 
Il primo test pubblico è stato effettuato nel maggio 2016 nel deserto del Nevada. Un piccolo vettore della lunghezza di 3 metri è stato lanciato sui binari per circa 2 secondi, raggiungendo la velocità di 187 km/h ed andandosi a fermare contro un cumulo di sabbia.[51][52][53] 
Come idea, è stata più volte criticata da alcuni esperti di urbanizzazione e di trasporti, in quanto, secondo molti, sarebbe più economico, efficiente ed ecologico usare gli stessi spazi e fondi per costruire un sistema ferroviario tradizionale.[54] 
Attualmente il progetto è portato avanti da diverse aziende, tra cui Virgin Hyperloop, non collegate direttamente a Elon Musk. Il coinvolgimento attuale di quest'ultimo nel progetto è rimasto nell'organizzazione di competizioni studentesche in scala ridotta note come Hyperloop Pod Competition svoltesi annualmente dal 2015 al 2019 nei pressi della sede di SpaceX e del centro design di Tesla ad Hawthorne, California.[55] 
Nel dicembre del 2015, Elon Musk ha annunciato la fondazione di OpenAI, una compagnia di ricerca dell'intelligenza artificiale (AI: artificial intelligence) no profit. OpenAI mira allo sviluppo di un'intelligenza artificiale forte in modo che sia sicura e benefica per l'umanità.[56] 
Rendendo accessibile le AI a tutti, OpenAI intende ""contrastare le grandi aziende che possono guadagnare troppo potere attraverso il possesso di sistemi super-intelligenti dedicati agli utili, così come i governi che possono utilizzare le AI per ottenere il potere, ma anche per opprimere i loro cittadini"".[57] Nel febbraio 2018, Musk ha lasciato la presidenza della società per evitare conflitti d'interesse con il suo ruolo presso Tesla, pur rimanendo un donatore.[58] 
Nel luglio 2016 Musk ha cofondato Neuralink, una startup di neurotecnologie incentrata sullo sviluppo di interfacce neurali, per collegare il cervello umano con l'intelligenza artificiale. La compagnia, che è ancora nelle prime fasi di sviluppo, è incentrata sulla creazione di interfacce neurali che possano essere impiantate nel cervello umano. Questi dispositivi potrebbero migliorare la memoria o consentire l'interfacciamento più diretto con i dispositivi informatici.[59] 
Nel 2016 Musk ha fondato The Boring Company, un'azienda di infrastrutture per creare una rete di tunnel sotterranei, con lo scopo dichiarato di ridurre il traffico. L'azienda ha costruito un tunnel di prova ad Hawthorne ed uno in operazione presso il Convention Center di Las Vegas con piani di espansione lungo il Las Vegas Strip, progetto noto con il nome di Vegas Loop. Nuovi progetti sono attesi a Fort Lauderdale, Miami e San Antonio.[60][61][62][63] 
Dal 2021 l'azienda propone una competizione annuale per gruppi studenteschi e amatoriali nota come Not-A-Boring-Competition.[64] 
Il 5 aprile 2022 diventa il maggior azionista di Twitter, dopo aver acquisito il 9,2% delle sue azioni per un valore di circa 3 miliardi, diventando membro del CdA.[65][66] Venti giorni dopo, invece, viene definito l'accordo per l'acquisizione dell'intera società per l'ammontare di 44 miliardi di dollari circa.[67][68][69] 
L'offerta è stata successivamente ritirata da Musk, che ha accusato Twitter di aver dichiarato una percentuale di account falsi ben al di sotto di quella reale, violando così gli accordi.[70] 
Nonostante ciò, il 28 ottobre 2022 torna sui suoi passi, concludendo l'acquisizione e trasformando la società in una azienda privata di proprietà della X Holdings; in seguito alla conclusione dell’acquisto, Musk licenzia la maggior parte del personale, tra cui importanti manager.[71][72] 
Il 16 dicembre 2022 Twitter ha bloccato i profili di diversi giornalisti, che avevano dato informazioni sui suoi spostamenti aerei. Per tale ragione, è stato criticato di voler limitare la libertà di stampa e la Commissione europea ha annunciato l'assunzione di sanzioni nei confronti del social network per la violazione del Regolamento (UE) 2022/2065 sul mercato unico dei servizi digitali, per il mancato rispetto della libertà dei media e dei diritti fondamentali.[73] 
Il 3 novembre 2023 annuncia il debutto a partire dal giorno dopo di xAI, la sua società dedicata allo sviluppo dell'intelligenza artificiale generativa.[74] 
L'istituto americano aero/astronautico (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics) lo ha insignito del premio George M. Low Space Transportation Award per il ""contributo più rilevante nello sviluppo di sistemi di trasporto spaziale commerciale, usando innovativi approcci a basso prezzo"".[75][76] È stato riconosciuto Living Legend in Aviation (Leggenda vivente dell'aviazione) dalla Kitty Hawk Foundation nel 2010 per aver creato il successore dello Space Shuttle (Falcon 9 e capsula Dragon). Tra le altre personalità insignite di questa onorificenza si annoverano Buzz Aldrin e Richard Branson.[77] 
Ha vinto il prestigioso Werner Von Braun Award (in italiano: Premio Werner Von Braun) della National Space Society (Società spaziale nazionale) nel 2008-2009.[78] Nel giugno 2011 Musk ha vinto i 500 000 dollari dell'Heinlein Prize for Advances in Space Commercialization (Premio Heinlein per avanzamenti nella commercializzazione spaziale).[79] Nel febbraio 2011 la rivista di economia e finanza Forbes ha nominato Musk come uno degli ""Amministratori delegati più potenti d'America con meno di 40 anni"".[80] 
La rivista Esquire lo ha nominato come una delle 75 persone più influenti del XXI secolo.[81] Nel 2010 Musk è stato eletto nel consiglio di amministrazione dell'Università di Pasadena: California Institute of Technology.[82] In un sondaggio della Space Foundation del 2010 Musk è stato classificato come il decimo (a pari merito con Wernher von Braun, lo scienziato iniziatore dell'astronautica moderna) eroe spaziale più popolare.[83] 
Nel 2021 viene nominato Persona dell'anno dalla rivista Time.[84] 
Musk si è auto-definito come ""metà democratico, metà repubblicano"", affermando di essere progressista sulle tematiche sociali e conservatore in materia fiscale.[86] Nel 2018 ha affermato in un tweet di essere politicamente indipendente e moderato.[87]
Nonostante in passato abbia finanziato le campagne elettorali del candidato alla rielezione presidenziale George W. Bush e del senatore repubblicano Marco Rubio, nel 2015 Musk risultava uno dei maggiori contributori del Partito Democratico. Musk ha affermato che finanziare i partiti politici è uno dei requisiti per avere voce in capitolo nell'agenda governativa.[88] Convintamente ambientalista, Musk è stato duramente critico nei confronti dell'allora presidente Donald Trump, soprattutto in relazione alle posizioni negazioniste del cambiamento climatico del tycoon.[89] Nel giugno 2017, in seguito al ritiro degli Stati Uniti dall'accordo di Parigi sul clima, Musk si è polemicamente dimesso dai consigli consultivi di due aziende di Trump.[90] Alle primarie democratiche del 2020 ha sostenuto la candidatura di Andrew Yang e ha espresso supporto per la proposta di introdurre un reddito di base;[91] ha inoltre sostenuto la candidatura presidenziale da indipendente del rapper Kanye West.[92] Nel settembre 2021, il governatore del Texas Greg Abbott ha sostenuto che Musk supportasse le politiche sociali adottate in Texas, in particolare le restrittive leggi sull'aborto; Musk ha risposto a tali affermazioni, smentendo il governatore e affermando che: ""il governo dovrebbe imporre il meno possibile la propria volontà sulla gente e, se proprio è necessario che lo faccia, dovrebbe aspirare a massimizzare la felicità collettiva. Detto questo, preferirei restare fuori dalla politica"".[93] Musk si è espresso contro la proposta di aumentare le tasse sui miliardari, criticando il senatore democratico Ron Wyden, uno dei proponenti della riforma.[94][95] 
Nel luglio 2020, Musk ha postato su Twitter il messaggio ""Pronouns suck"",[96] generando numerosi commenti negativi, tra cui quello della sua allora compagna Grimes. Diversi attivisti per i diritti LGBTQ+ hanno definito il tweet come transfobico. Nel dicembre 2020 Musk ha nuovamente criticato l'uso dei pronomi personali sui social per definire la propria identità di genere. La Human Rights Campaign ha criticato le esternazioni di Musk e lo ha invitato a scusarsi.[97][98] 
Musk ha affermato diverse volte che, secondo lui, il governo americano non dovrebbe erogare sussidi alle grandi aziende, sostenendo invece la maggiore utilità di una carbon tax per favorire la transizione ecologica.[99] Le sue posizioni sono state ritenute ""ipocrite"" da numerosi critici, in quanto le sue aziende hanno largamente beneficiato di sussidi statali.[100][101] Inoltre, Tesla ha guadagnato rilevanti somme dal sistema di crediti e agevolazioni per i mezzi non inquinanti, in vigore a livello sia statale in California che federale in tutti gli Stati Uniti, che ha fortemente incoraggiato l'acquisto di veicoli elettrici da parte dei consumatori.[102] Inoltre, una porzione rilevanti dei guadagni di Tesla provengono dai crediti di carbonio garantiti all'azienda dall'Unione europea e dalla Cina.[103][104][105][106] 
Nel novembre 2021 Musk ha deriso il senatore Bernie Sanders su Twitter. Sanders aveva postato un messaggio in cui affermava l'esigenza di chiedere ai più ricchi di pagare la giusta quota di tasse. Musk ha risposto al tweet con ""continuo a dimenticarmi del fatto che tu sia ancora vivo"".[107][108] 
Nel dicembre 2021, in un'intervista per il sito satirico The Babylon Bee, Musk ha lamentato come per lui fosse difficile raggiungere i suoi obiettivi produttivi in California. Musk ha venduto il 10% delle sue azioni di Tesla e ha delocalizzato l'azienda dalla California al Texas per sfuggire alla tassazione californiana. Musk ha affermato che ""la California era la terra delle opportunità, e ora è diventata la terra dell'ipertassazione e dell'iperregolamentazione"". Nella stessa intervista ha criticato l'ideologia woke, definendola ""divisiva, escludente e odiosa. Offre alle persone cattive uno scudo per essere meschine e crudeli, mascherate dietro una falsa virtù"".[109] 
Sul fronte della crisi Russia-Ucraina del 2022, Musk ha annunciato misure per supportare la resistenza ucraina, tra cui permettere gratuitamente al Paese europeo l'accesso al sistema di satelliti Starlink per garantire la connessione internet anche nel pieno del conflitto. Per queste iniziative, il presidente ucraino Volodymyr Zelens'kyj ha pubblicamente ringraziato Musk.[110] Nonostante le richieste di diversi governi a Starlink di bloccare l'accesso ai siti di informazione russi in risposta all'invasione, Musk ha affermato di essere un ""assolutista della libertà di parola"" e di non voler bloccare i siti russi ""a meno che non mi puntino contro una pistola"".[111][112][113][114][115][116][117] 
Nel maggio 2022 ha affermato in un tweet di aver intenzione di votare per il Partito Repubblicano, sostenendo che, nonostante egli avesse sostenuto in passato il Partito Democratico, quest'ultimo sia diventato il ""partito delle divisioni e dell'odio"".[118][119] 
Nel gennaio 2023 sostiene apertamente la candidatura a Speaker della Camera del Repubblicano Kevin McCarthy.[120] 
Musk ha ricevuto critiche sulle sue opinioni e azioni relative alla pandemia di COVID-19.[121] Il 31 gennaio 2020 paragona alcuni aspetti della COVID-19 al comune raffreddore e afferma che ""il panico da coronavirus è stupido"",[122] e ""il pericolo del panico supera di gran lunga il pericolo del coronavirus, se allochiamo troppe risorse mediche per il corona, ciò avverrà a spese del trattamento di altre malattie"".[123] Musk è stato inoltre criticato per aver rilasciato affermazioni controverse sulla malattia, inclusa l'affermazione[124] che ""I bambini sono essenzialmente immuni"",[125] accompagnando un grafico in cui si mostra che nessun bambino era morto in Italia entro il 15 marzo 2020,[126][127] sostenendo quindi che ""Sulla base delle tendenze attuali, probabilmente negli Stati Uniti si andrà vicino a zero nuovi casi entro la fine di aprile"".[128] Il 30 aprile 2020 negli Stati Uniti si registreranno 31.000 nuovi casi, per un totale di circa 1,1 milioni.[129] Inoltre ha promosso articoli che suggerivano che le compagnie sanitarie gonfiassero i numeri dei casi COVID-19 per motivi finanziari, ha promosso un documento sui benefici della clorochina che è stato successivamente ampiamente screditato e rimosso da Google e ha ritwittato un video che chiedeva la fine immediata alle misure di distanziamento sociale.[130][131] 
Quando lo sceriffo della contea di Alameda ordinò la chiusura di tutte le attività non essenziali, Musk e la Tesla inizialmente rifiutarono di eseguire l'ordine, sostenendo che la produzione di veicoli e le infrastrutture energetiche sono settori critici, citando il Dipartimento della Sicurezza Nazionale degli Stati Uniti.[132][133] 
«Se qualcuno vuole restare a casa sua, questo è grandioso. Dovrebbero essere autorizzati a rimanere nella loro casa e non dovrebbero essere costretti a uscire, ma dire che non possono lasciare la loro casa e saranno arrestati se lo faranno, questo è fascista, questo non è democratico, questa non è libertà. Ridate alle persone la loro dannata libertà.[134]» 
In seguito Musk invia numerosi tweet in opposizione ai blocchi obbligatori, come ""AMERICA LIBERA ORA!"",[135][136] sostenendo che gli ospedali della California sarebbero ""mezzi vuoti"".[137] 
L'11 maggio 2020 Musk riapre la linea di produzione Fremont di Tesla in violazione dell'ordinanza della contea di Alameda. Lo stesso giorno dichiarerà: ""Tesla sta riprendendo la produzione oggi contro le regole della contea di Alameda. Sarò in linea con tutti gli altri. Se qualcuno verrà arrestato, chiedo che sia solo io.""[138] Musk minaccia di spostare il quartier generale della Tesla in Texas o Nevada. La Tesla intenta una causa contro la contea di Alameda sfidando il suo blocco alla fabbrica di Fremont: la causa viene successivamente ritirata.[139][140] Il dipartimento della sanità pubblica della contea di Alameda ha spiegato che stava aspettando un piano che Tesla aveva promesso di fornire l'11 maggio per illustrare come proteggere la salute dei lavoratori durante la pandemia di COVID-19.[141] Il 2 giugno 2020 un lavoratore di Tesla risulta positivo per COVID-19 dopo la riapertura della fabbrica di Tesla a Buffalo, New York, il primo caso da quando Tesla ha riaperto le sue fabbriche statunitensi.[142] 
Tra maggio e dicembre del 2020, in una fabbrica Tesla in California, sono stati registrati 450 casi di positività alla COVID-19.[143] 
Musk si è sposato due volte e ha avuto 11 figli, l'ultimo chiamato con il nome di Techno Mechanicus, soprannominato Tau, è il terzo figlio nato dalla relazione con la ex compagna Grimes, con cui ha fatto coppia fissa dal 2018 al 2022. La nascita di Tau Techno Machanicus non è stata rivelata fino all'11 settembre 2023 [144]. La sua prima moglie è stata Justine Wilson, una scrittrice canadese, conosciuta quando erano entrambi studenti alla Queen's University. Musk e la Wilson si sposano nel 2000 e hanno cinque figli, più uno morto prematuramente.[145] La coppia si separa nel settembre del 2008.[146] Nel 2010, dopo averla frequentata per due anni, Musk si sposa con l'attrice inglese Talulah Riley. Nel gennaio 2012 i due si lasciano[147] e nel luglio 2013 si risposano, per poi separarsi nuovamente nel dicembre 2014 e divorziare alla fine del 2016.[148] Nel frattempo Musk frequenta l'attrice americana Amber Heard, ma i due si lasciano un anno più tardi.[149] Nel 2018 si fidanza con la cantante e musicista canadese Grimes (pseudonimo di Claire Boucher)[150] e il 4 maggio 2020 nasce il loro primo figlio, chiamato inizialmente X Æ A-12,[151] poi cambiato in X Æ A-XII a causa delle leggi vigenti in California.[152] Nel dicembre 2021 nasce, tramite madre surrogata, la seconda figlia Exa Dark Sideræl. La coppia, il 25 settembre 2021, ha dichiarato l'intenzione di lasciarsi ufficialmente,[153] per via del lavoro di Elon Musk in SpaceX e Tesla, che richiede la sua continua presenza in Texas ed all'estero. 
Ha partecipato nel 2004 al Burning Man festival e ha dichiarato che la prima idea per SolarCity gli è venuta proprio al festival.[23] 
La sorella di Elon, Tosca Musk, è la fondatrice della Musk Entertainment e la produttrice di vari film[154], fra cui Thank You for Smoking. Lo stesso Musk è stato il produttore esecutivo del suo primo film, Puzzled. Suo fratello Kimbal è l'amministratore delegato dell'azienda di pubblicità OneRiot ed è proprietario del ristorante The Kitchen a Boulder e a Denver, Colorado. Suo cugino Lyndon Rive è l'amministratore delegato e cofondatore di Solar City. 
Musk ha una figlia transgender di 18 anni, Vivian Jenna Wilson.[155][156] 
Durante la sua conduzione del Saturday Night Live a maggio 2021, Musk ha rivelato di avere la sindrome di Asperger.[157] 
In Iron Man 2 (2010), Musk incontra Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in un ristorante e parla di una sua ""idea per un jet elettrico"".[158] 
Appare in un cammeo nel film del 2014 Transcendence (film) come spettatore in platea durante una presentazione sull'intelligenza artificiale. 
Nel gennaio 2015, Musk fece un'apparizione come se stesso ne I Simpson nell'episodio numero 564 intitolato Il Musk che cadde sulla terra; l'episodio prendeva in giro molte delle idee di Musk.[159] 
Nel novembre 2015, Musk interpretò se stesso in un episodio di The Big Bang Theory, offrendosi volontario alla mensa dei poveri con Wolowitz.[160] 
Musk fece un'apparizione anche nel documentario ambientale del 2015 intitolato Racing Extinction, nel quale una Tesla Model S personalizzata fu ideata per proiettare immagini di specie in via d'estinzione su edifici pubblici, come l'Empire State Building e il Vaticano[non chiaro][161] 
Nel 2016, Musk interpretò se stesso nella commedia romantica Proprio lui? dove incontrò uno dei protagonisti, Ned Flemming, interpretato da Bryan Cranston, in un bar durante una festa.[162] 
Nell'ottobre 2017, Musk fu prematuramente commemorato come un pioniere nella serie Star Trek: Discovery di CBS All Access. Nell'anno 2256, il capitano Gabriel Lorca tenta di motivare uno scienziato della sua nave chiedendogli: ""Come vuoi essere ricordato nella storia? Accanto ai fratelli Wright, Elon Musk, Zefram Cochrane? O come esperto di funghi fallito?""[163][164] 
Nel novembre 2017, Musk interpretò se stesso nel sesto episodio della prima stagione di Young Sheldon. 
Il 22 febbraio 2019 ha co-condotto lo show Meme Review di PewDiePie. 
Il 30 ottobre 2019 ha donato un milione di dollari per donare alberi al sito teamtrees.com con il messaggio ""For Treebeard"", diventando la persona ad aver donato di più sul sito prima di essere superato da Tobi Lutke.[165] 
Ha dato la voce al personaggio di Elon Tusk (basato su se stesso) nel terzo episodio della 4ª stagione di Rick and Morty.[166]

Elon Musk est actuellement PDG de Space X, directeur général de Tesla et PDG du réseau social X (anciennement Twitter jusqu'en juillet 2023).    Né le 28 juin 1971 à Pretoria en Afrique du Sud, il est en janvier 2023 le deuxième homme le plus riche du monde, derrière Bernard Arnault, avec une fortune estimée à 158 milliards de dollars. Dès l'âge de 12 ans, Elon Musk vend son premier programme de jeux vidéo et en obtient 500 dollars. Depuis, l'homme d'affaires ne cesse d'inventer et de surprendre. Après des études en Afrique du Sud, il obtient la nationalité canadienne et part étudier à Kingston (Ontario). Son entrée à l'université est financée grâce à des emplois à temps partiel dans le domaine de l'informatique. En 1992, il quitte le Canada pour les Etats-Unis, où il étudie la physique et l'économie.   Très vite, il va investir dans des entreprises ou des innovations. Elon Musk a pour ambition de changer le monde et l'humanité, tout en réduisant le réchauffement climatique. En 1995, il co-fonde Zip2 avec son frère Kimbal et Gré Kouri, un ami. Zip2 est un logiciel de publication de contenu en ligne pour les entreprises. Celui-ci va notamment aider les médias, face à l'arrivée d'Internet. En 1999, l'entreprise est rachetée 307 millions de dollars par Compaq et Elon Musk y gagne 22 millions. Il profitera de ce pécule pour créer immédiatement une nouvelle société : X.com, qui propose des services bancaires en ligne. Et alors que les experts sont sceptiques sur l'essor du paiement en ligne, sa société fusionne en 2000 avec Confinity et donne naissance à Paypal. En 2002, eBay rachète PayPal pour 1,5 milliard de dollars et Elon Musk empoche 250 millions, qu'il utilise pour se lancer dans de nouvelles aventures.   Après Internet, Elon Musk voit plus loin et veut s'attaquer à l'espace. Il crée en 2002 Space X qui développe des véhicules de lancement spatiaux, avec pour objectif de baisser les coûts et de rendre à l'avenir possible une colonisation sur Mars. En décembre 2015, Space X réalise la première récupération de son lanceur Falcon 9 et ce même lanceur est utilisé en novembre 2020 pour envoyer des astronautes vers la station spatiale internationale. L'entreprise développe aussi le programme Starlink pour rendre un accès à haut débit à Internet par satellites sur Terre.   C'est principalement pour son rôle au sein de Tesla qu'Elon Musk est connu du public. Entré au capital de celle-ci en 2004 avec un financement de 6,5 millions de dollars, il prend la direction de la société en 2008. Elon Musk souhaite rendre les voitures électriques plus accessibles. Se concentrant sur l'essor de sa production plutôt que sur sa rentabilité, Tesla a dégagé pour la première fois en 2020 un bénéfice net de 721 millions de dollars. Enfin, Elon Musk a investi dans d'autres projets ou sociétés comme The Boring Company, une entreprise de construction de tunnel en ville ou encore Hyperloop, un projet de recherche sur un cinquième mode de transport supersonique. Il a aussi cofondé Neuralink, une entreprise qui développe des implants cérébraux. Ce milliardaire a également un gros impact sur les cours de la Bourse, via ses tweets notamment. En mai 2021, lorsqu'il a annoncé via Twitter, que Tesla n'allait plus accepter les bitcoins comme mode de paiement, le cours de cette cryptomonnaie a directement reculé de 12%.  Au printemps 2022, il annonce son intention d'acheter Twitter pour 43 milliards de dollars après avoir acquis 9,1 % de l'entreprise pour 2,6 milliards de dollars. Il se rétracte finalement en mai, invoquant un nombre sous-estimé de faux comptes par le réseau social. La justice américaine contraint finalement le milliardaire à respecter son engagement de rachat, ce qu'il réalise en octobre 2022. Après plusieurs semaines chaotiques, il publie un sondage sur son compte demandant aux internautes s'il devait se retirer ou non de la direction de Twitter. 57 % des réponses à ce sondage sont en faveur de son départ. Il annonce le 20 décembre 2022 son futur retrait de l'entreprise américaine dès qu'il aura trouvé quelqu'un ""d'assez fou"" pour lui succéder.   
L’opérateur français Orange lance ce jeudi 16 novembre un nouveau service haut débit pour les publics qui n’ont pas accès à la fibre. Le but: garder la main face aux ambitions d’Elon Musk. Joe Biden est de nouveau à Detroit, ce jeudi, pour rendre visite au syndicat de l'automobile UAW, grand vainqueur d'une grève contre les géants de l'automobile. A l'approche de la présidentielle, l'enjeu politique est important. Tout comme le sera l'issue d'un bras de fer au sommet entre le syndicat de l'automobile et Elon Musk, le patron de Tesla.  Le réseau social X (ex-Twitter) a publié ce dimanche 5 novembre son premier rapport de transparence sur le contrôle des contenus, demandé par la réglementation DSA de l'Union européenne. Et alors que la France détient la palme des propos violents et illicites, le constat est sans appel: trop peu de modérateurs lui sont consacrés. Omniprésent dans le débat public depuis plusieurs années, le réseau social est plus que jamais contesté. Mais les personnalités publiques peinent à le quitter et la concurrence semble dérisoire. Avec deux ans de retard, le Cybertruck arrive enfin. Toutefois, Elon Musk ""tempère les attentes"" et admet ""avoir creusé sa propre tombe"" en s’obstinant à vouloir habiller son pick-up d’acier inoxydable. La source de bien des misères pour les ingénieurs. Les résultats de Tesla pour le troisième trimestre ont été plombés par la hausse de ses coûts de production et par les baisses de prix consenties pour contenir l'offensive des constructeurs chinois. X (ancien Twitter) avait jusqu’au 18 octobre pour s’expliquer de leur mauvaise régulation après l’attaque du Hamas contre Israël. Plus que les autres, la figure d'Elon Musk crispe le commissaire européen Thierry Breton. Pour compenser la baisse de ses revenus publicitaires, Meta envisage de renoncer à son modèle gratuit. D'autres plateformes telles que X, Snapchat et TikTok, sont déjà passées au payant ou y réfléchissent. Sous le regard scrutateur des régulateurs. ""À la suite des attaques terroristes menées par le Hamas contre Israël, nous disposons d'indications selon lesquelles votre plateforme est utilisée pour diffuser des contenus illégaux et de la désinformation dans l'UE"", a écrit Thierry Breton à Elon Musk, en l'avertissant de possibles sanctions. Elon Musk, qui se voulait un temps ""médiateur"" dans le conflit russo-ukrainien, prend des positions de plus en plus dures vis-à-vis de l'Ukraine. L'énième suggestion de son propriétaire Elon Musk, destinée à réduire le nombre de robots sur la plateforme, paraît logique d'un point de vue économique, mais pourrait aussi ""décimer"" sa base d'utilisateurs, selon des experts. Les patrons de Meta (Facebook) et X (ex-Twitter) se sont à nouveau écharpés par plateforme interposée dimanche, Mark Zuckerberg accusant Elon Musk de ne pas prendre l'idée de leur ""combat"" au sérieux. Les milliardaires évoquent depuis fin juin un combat d'arts martiaux mixtes (MMA) censé les opposer en chair et en os. Aucune date n'a été fixée. En matière de protection des données, Elon Musk a déjà déçu. Son ambition de faire de X - le nouveau Twitter - une copie de l'application chinoise WeChat doit-elle inquiéter, alors que l'entrepreneur entretient des liens robustes avec Pékin ? Elon Musk, propriétaire de Twitter, et la nouvelle directrice générale du réseau social, Linda Yaccarino, recrutée il y a tout juste un mois, ont annoncé que la plateforme allait se lancer rapidement dans les paiements, les services bancaires et le commerce.  En annonçant la construction d'une nouvelle usine d'assemblage de satellites en Floride, Amazon fait un pas de plus pour se doter d'une constellation de plus de 3.200 satellites. Mais Starlink, d'Elon Musk, fait la course en tête. Les sévères réductions de prix de Tesla ont rogné la marge bénéficiaire du constructeur à 9,6% au deuxième trimestre 2023, contre 11,4% au premier. Et... 14,6% en comparaison du deuxième trimestre 2022. Malgré de mauvais résultats dans les enquêtes de fiabilité, Tesla affiche toutefois un bond de 86% des ventes. Et le gros pick-up Cybertruck arrive sur le marché. REPORTAGE - L’opérateur historique a annoncé lancer prochainement une nouvelle offre satellite sous la marque Orange. A Bercenay-en-Othe, station de télécommunications spatiales, le groupe a d'ailleurs martelé l’importance d’être un acteur majeur des satellites pour conserver la souveraineté de la France.  Elon Musk a affirmé ce samedi que Twitter avait perdu près de la moitié de ses revenus publicitaires. Les évolutions engagées par Elon Musk depuis sa prise de contrôle de Twitter ont mécontenté utilisateurs du réseau et annonceurs.  REPORTAGE - Le milliardaire a installé dans ce hameau texan de Boca Chica, perdu à la frontière mexicaine, sa spectaculaire Starbase pour lancer les fusées de SpaceX. Le but : emmener un jour l'homme sur Mars. Mais le site engendre des retombées contestées, entre pluie de millions et impact environnemental. Plongée au cœur des terres d'Elon Musk.  L'application Threads, créée par Meta pour concurrencer Twitter, a franchi la barre des 100 millions d'utilisateurs cinq jours seulement après son lancement, a confirmé le fondateur du groupe Mark Zuckerberg. Le ""rythme"" des futures baisses d'impôts en France dépendra du niveau de croissance attendu pour le pays, qui sera révisé en septembre pour les années 2023 et 2024, a déclaré dimanche le ministre de l'Economie et des Finances, Bruno Le Maire. Elon Musk a annoncé ce samedi 1er juillet que Twitter allait restreindre temporairement la lecture de tweets. Objectif : contenir l'utilisation de données du réseau social par des tiers, notamment pour alimenter les modèles d'intelligence artificielle. SONDAGE EXCLUSIF - A l’occasion du Club Entrepreneurs Challenges-Grant Thornton du 22 juin, trois dirigeants se sont livrés sur leur parcours et leurs sources d’inspiration. L'occasion également pour l'institut de sondage OpinionWay de demander à un panel de 220 dirigeants d’entreprise française qui était le patron ou la patronne qui les ""inspirait"". Les salariés américains n'ont jamais été aussi satisfaits de leur boulot depuis 1987, selon une étude qui fait du bruit aux Etats-Unis. Vrai? Faux? Le débat est ouvert, avec des explications surprenantes. Emmanuel Macron a annoncé mercredi qu'il allait rencontrer le patron de Twitter et Tesla, Elon Musk, vendredi pour lui ""parler d'automobile"" alors que le gouvernement français souhaite convaincre le milliardaire américain d'installer une usine en France. Première vente dans le monde et en Europe, le SUV Tesla Y a plus de mal en France. mais le véhicule électrique haut de gamme est dans le palmarès des dix modèles les plus vendus dans l'Hexagone. La Chine entend se faire une place dans l'Internet des satellites, préparant son propre système d'accès satellitaire à Internet. Mais l'orbite basse terrestre est déjà encombrée... Le propriétaire du réseau social redistribue les cartes et se dote d'une PDG, Linda Yaccarino, ancienne directrice de la publicité de NBCUniversal. Sa mission? Relancer les recettes publicitaires après une année chaotique. Un système de compte professionnel payant se profile. Ford est le premier constructeur à adopter la norme de charge rapide conçue par Tesla. De quoi doubler le nombre de bornes rapides à disposition de ses clients américains et gommer l’angoisse de la panne. Faux départ pour la campagne à la présidentielle de Ron DeSantis, le principal rival de Donald Trump à l'investiture du parti républicain pour 2024. Dans un live sur Twitter perturbé par de nombreux problèmes techniques, le gouverneur de Floride a tenté d'échanger avec Elon Musk. Le patron controversé du réseau social avait promis il y a six mois de laisser la place à une nouvelle personnalité à sa tête après avoir été désavoué par un vote des internautes.  Elon Musk dit avoir engagé une femme pour diriger Twitter. Celle dont l'identité n'a pas été dévoilée prendra ses fonctions dans 6 semaines, quand Musk deviendra directeur de la technologie pour superviser les services, les logiciels et les systèmes. Autrefois gratuite, et gage d'authenticité et de notoriété, le badge bleu signifie désormais que l'utilisateur est abonné à Twitter Blue (pour 8 dollars par mois) et que son numéro de téléphone a été vérifié par la plateforme. Ces dernières semaines, Twitter avait appliqué sur les comptes de grands médias des mentions controversées, ""média affilié à l'Etat"" et ""média financé par des fonds gouvernementaux"", avant de les supprimer vendredi. La fusée géante de SpaceX a explosé en plein vol ce jeudi 20 avril après un décollage réussi. Il s'agit déjà d'une victoire pour Starship qui affiche des dimensions aussi énormes que ses ambitions commerciales. Mais le marché est-il suffisamment grand pour un lanceur de cette capacité? Revue de détail. Tesla a plusieurs fois baissé ses prix au cours des derniers mois pour stimuler la demande pour ses véhicules électriques, une décision qui permet à ses ventes de continuer à grimper mais pèse aussi sur ses profits. De 53.490 à... 41.990 euros en quelques mois à peine. C'est la première fois qu'un constructeur abaisse autant ses prix catalogue. En plus, Tesla octroie des remises sur des véhicules même pas en stock, puisqu'ils n'ont pas encore atteint le territoire français. Du jamais vu. De quoi inquiéter Renault et sa Mégane E-Tech, désormais plus chère! SpaceX devrait procéder cet après-midi au premier tir de sa fusée géante Starship/Super Heavy. Au-delà de sa taille record, ce lanceur est surtout un pari technologique inédit. Explosion, report ou succès retentissant? Le moment décisif approche pour SpaceX, qui doit tenter lundi le premier vol d'essai de Starship, la plus grande et la plus puissante fusée du monde, destinée à des voyages vers la Lune et Mars. Vous avez décroché de l’actualité ce week-end? Voici les informations que Challenges a sélectionnées pour ce week-end du samedi 1er et dimanche 2 avril. Au programme: les comptes certifiés sur Twitter deviennent payants ; le Crédit Suisse ciblé par une enquête ; ou encore une concertation à Paris sur les trottinettes électriques. A partir de ce samedi 1er avril, la plupart des comptes Twitter ""certifiés"" devront payer un abonnement. Elon Musk a défendu vendredi sa décision, controversée. Il estime que les réseaux sociaux qui ne suivront pas son exemple péricliteront à terme, submergés de faux comptes. EDITORIAL. Un millier de personnalités, dont le fondateur de Tesla et Space X Elon Musk, s'inquiètent du développement fulgurant dans la sphère publique de l'intelligence artificielle et demandent un moratoire. La lettre ouverte suffira-t-elle à la stopper, vu les intérêts en jeu ? Non, répond notre éditorialiste Dominique Leglu.  Facebook et Twitter veulent faire payer leurs utilisateurs pour prouver qu'ils sont bien ""eux-mêmes"". L'identité va-t-elle devenir un produit de luxe ? Une nouvelle salve de licenciements frapperait Twitter, rapporte Bloomberg. Les salariés qui restent en place espèrent peut-être que l'entreprise retrouvera un peu de sérénité une fois que Elon Musk aura passé la main à son successeur, dont l'arrivée est annoncée à la fin de l'année.  La nouvelle version payante de Twitter classe désormais ses utilisateurs: compte bleu pour les abonnés, compte gris ou jaune pour les gouvernements et étiquettes spécifiques pour les robots ou les ""médias affiliés à des États"". Ariane 6, Vulcan Centaur (ULA), et peut-être New Glenn (Blue Origin)… L’année 2023 pourrait voir un nombre record de vols inauguraux de nouveaux lanceurs, destinés à répondre à la domination de SpaceX. Problème: le groupe d’Elon Musk prépare déjà l’étape suivante, avec son lanceur géant Starship.  Après avoir dépassé les 1.000 milliards de dollars, la capitalisation de Tesla a perdu les deux-tiers de sa valeur en 2022. Les ventes de la firme californienne ont certes bondi de 40% l'an dernier. Mais le chouchou de Wall Street, Elon Musk, suscite la méfiance pour sa gestion erratique de Twitter et le ralentissement de la demande pour ses voitures électriques. Le réseau social racheté par Elon Musk semble de nouveau fonctionner  après une panne qui a affecté mercredi des milliers d'utilisateurs pendant plusieurs heures. Son accès était fortement perturbé. Twitter a supprimé une fonction qui mettait en avant les numéros de téléphone d'organisations spécialisées, entre autres, dans la prévention du suicide, une décision qui aurait été prise par Elon Musk, le nouveau propriétaire du réseau social. Elon Musk fait demi-tour. Celui qui a acquis Twitter pour 44 milliards de dollars cette année est revenu sur la suspension de comptes de plusieurs journalistes. Dans cette période trouble, les utilisateurs du réseau social s'inquiètent, et la fortune d'Elon Musk s'effrite. Déjà un compte ? Je me connecte

https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk,Elon Musk – Wikipedie,20231101,Elon Musk ... Elon Reeve Musk (* 28. června 1971 Pretorie) je americký podnikatel a inženýr. Založil kosmickou společnost SpaceX a stál u vzniku automobilky Tesla ...,"Elon Reeve Musk (* 28. června 1971 Pretorie) je americký podnikatel a inženýr[2]. Založil kosmickou společnost SpaceX a stál u vzniku automobilky Tesla, kterou nyní jako CEO řídí. V minulosti spoluvlastnil internetový platební systém PayPal. V lednu 2021 jej agentura Bloomberg poprvé označila za nejbohatšího člověka světa, s majetkem převyšujícím 200 miliard dolarů.[3][4] O toto prvenství přišel v prosinci 2022.[1] V květnu 2023 se stal znovu nejbohatším člověkem světa. 
Elon Musk se narodil 28. června 1971 ve městě Pretoria v kolonii Transvaal v Jihoafrické republice.[5] Byl prvorozeným synem manželů Maye a Errol Muskových. Má dva mladší sourozence – bratra Kimbala (narodil se v roce 1972) a sestru Toscu (narodila se v roce 1974).[6][7] Jeho rodiče se rozvedli v roce 1980. Musk povětšinou žil se svým otcem na předměstí Pretorie.[8] Takto se rozhodl dva roky po rozvodu svých rodičů, který neustále odmítal.[9] Musk se pak odcizil od svého otce, kterého označil jako „hroznou lidskou bytost“.[9] Má také nevlastního bratra a sestru.[10][11] 
V mládí byl vášnivý čtenář. V 10 letech se začal zajímat o počítače a používal počítač Commodore VIC-20.[12] Naučil se programovat pomocí manuálu, a ve 12 letech vyvinul hru jménem Blastar, v programovacím jazyce BASIC, kterou prodal za 500 dolarů.[13] Jeho mládí ovlivnila knižní série Nadace spisovatele Isaaca Asimova, ze které si vzal myšlenku „měli byste se pokusit podniknout řadu akcí, které pravděpodobně prodlouží civilizaci, minimalizují pravděpodobnost temného věku a zkrátí délku temného věku, pokud existuje“.[14][15] 
Musk navštěvoval Waterkloofskou domácí přípravnou školu a Bryanstonskou střední školu, poté vystudoval Pretorijskou chlapeckou střední školu.[16] Ve škole byl jako nejmladší šikanován.[9] Přestože se Muskův otec snažil, aby Elon vystudoval Pretorijskou vysokou školu, Musk se rozhodl přestěhovat do Ameriky, a řekl „vzpomínám si, myslel jsem si a viděl jsem, že Amerika je místo, kde jsou úžasné věci možnější, než v ostatních státech světa“.[17] Musk věděl, že bude jednodušší dostat se do Ameriky přes Kanadu,[18] kam se přestěhoval v červnu roku 1989, těsně před svými 18. narozeninami, i když s tím jeho otec nesouhlasil. Do Kanady se dostal díky kanadskému pasu, který získal prostřednictvím své matky, která se v Kanadě narodila.[19] 
Když čekal na dokumenty s kanadským občanstvím, studoval pět měsíců Pretorijskou vysokou školu. V Kanadě nastoupil na Královskou univerzitu, aby se vyhnul narukování do Jihoafrických obranných sil.[20] Kanadskou univerzitu opustil v roce 1992, aby studoval ekonomiku a fyziku na Pensylvánské univerzitě, kde promoval v roce 1997 s bakalářským titulem (Bachelor of Arts).[21][22][23] 
V létě roku 1994 se Musk zúčastnil dvou praxí v Silicon Valley. První byla se start-upem, zaměřeným na uskladňování energie, který se jmenoval Pinnacle Research Institute[24] a zkoumal superkondenzátory. Druhou firmou byl paloaltský start-up jménem Rocket Science Games.[24] Bruce Leak, který Muska najal, řekl: „Měl nekonečnou energii. Hoši v dnešní době nemají ponětí o hardwaru, nebo jak věci fungují, ale on měl minulost hackera a nebál se do toho ponořit.“[25] 
V roce 1995 začal doktorské studium aplikované fyziky na Stanfordově univerzitě v Kalifornii, ale už po dvou dnech studium ukončil, aby se mohl připojit k internetovému boomu a založit svoji první firmu Zip2.[26] 
Zip2 založil se svým bratrem Kimbalem, třetím zakladatelem byl investor Greg Kouri.[27] V roce 1999 firmu prodali za 307 mil. dolarů společnosti Compaq,[27] která službu začlenila do svého vyhledávače AltaVista.[28] Musk za svůj podíl obdržel 22 milionů dolarů.[29] 
V roce 1999 spoluzaložil platební společnost x.com. Ta se v roce 2000 spojila se společností Confinity a přejmenovala na PayPal.[30] Musk společnost vedl do září 2000. V březnu 2002 byla společnost zalistována na burze NASDAQ,[30] ještě v říjnu téhož roku ji koupila společnost eBay za 1,5 mld. dolarů.[31] Musk jako druhý největší akcionář obdržel 165 mil. dolarů.[29] 
V roce 2002 Musk založil kosmickou společnost SpaceX.[29] V roce 2004 poprvé zainvestoval do automobilky Tesla a začal se podílet na jejím vedení. Svůj podíl postupně zvyšoval, až se stal jejím největším akcionářem a od roku 2008 také CEO.[32] V roce 2010 byla společnost zalistována na burze NASDAQ.[32] 
V roce 2006 jako první investoval do společnosti SolarCity, která se ve Spojených státech zabývá instalací solárních panelů pro obytné domy.[33] Společnost založili jeho bratranci Peter a Lyndon Riveovi.[29] V roce 2012 byla společnost zalistována na burze NASDAQ,[34] v roce 2016 ji koupila společnost Tesla.[29] V roce 2016 také založil společnost The Boring Company, která se zaměřuje na vytváření tunelů a hyperloop tras, pro zefektivnění dopravy. 
V průběhu roku 2020 se jeho jmění zhodnotilo přibližně o 77 %, a to zejména díky prudkému růstu ceny akcií Tesly, která zvýšila svou tržní hodnotu o 743 %. Dne 7. ledna 2021 se Musk stal podle žebříčku agentury Bloomberg nejbohatším člověkem na světě s hodnotou majetku 185 miliard dolarů, a předběhl tak Jeffa Bezose. O dva dny později jeho majetek překročil hranici 200 miliard.[4] Kromě asi pětinového podílu v Tesle držel přibližně 48 % akcií podniku SpaceX.[35][36] 
Dne 13. dubna 2022 učinil dosavadním akcionářům nabídku na koupi 100 % akcií sociální sítě Twitter za 54,20 dolaru za akcii v celkové hodnotě 43 miliard dolarů. Dne 25. dubna bylo oznámeno, že Twitter je připraven Muskovu nabídku přijmout.[37][38][39][40] V říjnu 2022 Musk akvizici Twitteru za 44 miliard dolarů dokončil.[41] 
V prosinci 2022 jej v důsledku poklesu ceny akcií automobilky Tesla a akvizice Twitteru na prvním místě žebříčku nejbohatších lidí světa dle agentury Bloomberg vystřídal Bernard Arnault.[1] 
Poté, co v prosinci 2022 uživatelé Twitteru hlasovali v Muskem vytvořené anketě pro jeho odchod z pozice generálního ředitele společnosti, oznámil, že tak učiní, jakmile za sebe najde náhradu. V květnu 2023 uvedl, že jej ve funkci nahradí žena, z funkce má Musk odstoupit během léta 2023.[42] 
Musk má kanadské, americké a jihoafrické občanství.[43][44] 
V letech 2000 až 2008 byl ženatý s kanadskou spisovatelkou Justine Musk. Jejich první syn Nevada se narodil v roce 2002, ale zemřel v 10 měsících v důsledku syndromu náhlého úmrtí kojence. V roce 2004 měli dvojčata Griffina a Xaviera, v roce 2006 pak trojčata Damiana, Saxona a Kaie.[29] V letech 2010 až 2012 a znovu v letech 2013 až 2016 byl ženatý s anglickou herečkou Talulah Rileyovou.[9] 
Dne 7. května 2018 se objevil na americkém Met Gala po boku kanadské umělkyně Grimes,[45] se kterou začal žít. 5. května 2020 se Muskovi a Grimes narodil syn. Podle Muskova vyjádření na Twitteru dostal jméno X Æ A-12 Musk.[46] Kalifornské zákony toto jméno ale nedovolily, tudíž své dítě přejmenoval na X Æ A-Xii Musk.[47] V roce 2021 se rozešli.[48] 
Objevil se v seriálech Simpsonovi, Teorie velkého třesku, Městečko South Park, Rick a Morty a hrál ve filmech Iron Man 2, Proč právě on?, Machete zabíjí a Děkujeme, že kouříte. 
Až do konce roku 2020 bydlel v Los Angeles, ale od prosince téhož roku pobývá v Texasu.[49] 
V pořadu Saturday Night Live v živém vysílání 8. května 2021 řekl, že má Aspergerův syndrom.[50] 
V červenci 2022 zveřejnil deník Insider soudní dokumenty, z nichž vyplývá, že Musk měl v listopadu 2021 dvojčata se Shivon Zilisovou, ředitelkou operací a speciálních projektů společnosti Neuralink.[51][52][53] 
Musk se často označuje za libertariána, ale sám sebe označuje za „politicky umírněného“ a v době, kdy žil v Kalifornii, byl registrovaným nezávislým voličem. V roce 2018 se prohlásil za jediného pravého socialistu a o Karlu Marxovi, autorovi Komunistického manifestu, prohlásil, že to byl kapitalista.[54] Deník The New York Times napsal, že Musk „má názory, které nezapadají do (amerického) binárního politického rámce levice-pravice.“[55] Historicky Musk přispíval jak demokratickým, tak republikánským politikům, z nichž mnozí působí ve státech, v nichž podniká nebo má jiné zájmy.[55][56] Od konce roku 2010 se Muskovy politické příspěvky téměř výhradně přesunuly k podpoře Republikánů.[57] 
V prezidentských volbách v USA v roce 2016 Musk hlasoval pro Hillary Clintonovou[58], v prezidentských primárkách Demokratické strany v roce 2020 podpořil kandidáta Andrewa Yanga a vyjádřil podporu jeho návrhu základního nepodmíněného příjmu.[59] Opakovaně podpořil prezidentskou kampaň Kanye Westa v roce 2020[60], avšak následně podle svých slov volil v prezidentských volbách Joea Bidena.[58] V roce 2022 Musk prohlásil, že již nemůže podporovat demokraty, protože jsou údajně „stranou rozdělení a nenávisti“[61][62] a napsal tweet, ve kterém vyzval „nezávisle smýšlející voliče, “aby ve volbách v roce 2022 volili republikány, což bylo mezi vedoucími pracovníky sociálních médií, kteří se obvykle vyhýbají stranické politické propagaci, neobvyklé.[63][64] Podpořil republikána Rona DeSantise pro prezidentské volby v USA v roce 2024 a jeho sociální síť Twitter hostila oznámení DeSantisovy kampaně na službě Twitter Spaces.[65][66][67][68] V květnu 2023 Musk odmítl podpořit jakoukoli konkrétní kampaň.[66] 
Musk je proti „miliardářské dani“[69] a na Twitteru se přel s levicověji orientovanými demokratickými politiky, jako jsou Bernie Sanders[70], Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezová[71] a Elizabeth Warrenová[72]. Jeho argumenty však často obsahovaly arogantní urážky, Sandersovi napsal, že „nevěděl, že ještě žije,“ a Warrenovou označil za „Senátorku Karen.“ Vznesl otázky ohledně protestů Black Lives Matter, částečně na základě toho, že fráze „Ruce vzhůru, nestřílejte,“ kterou měl údajně říct George Floyd, byla vymyšlená.[73][74] Musk také propagoval nepodloženou teorii týkající se útoku na manžela předsedkyně parlamentu Nancy Pelosiové, později však svůj tweet smazal.[75] 
Musk chválil totalitní Čínskou lidovou republiku a byl popisován jako člověk, který má blízké vztahy s čínskou vládou a umožňuje společnosti Tesla přístup na její trhy.[76] Poté, co továrna Gigafactory Šanghaj vyrobila první várku vozidel, Musk poděkoval čínské vládě a čínskému lidu a zároveň kritizoval Spojené státy a jejich obyvatele.[77] V roce 2022 Musk napsal článek pro China Cyberspace, oficiální publikaci Čínské správy kyberprostoru, která v Číně prosazuje cenzuru internetu.[78][79] Napsání článku bylo označeno za rozporné s jeho obhajobou svobody projevu. Musk se později vyslovil také pro to, aby se Tchaj-wan stal „zvláštní správní zónou“ Čínské lidové republiky, což vyvolalo kritiku tchajwanských zákonodárců napříč stranami.[80][81][82] 
Od ruské invaze na Ukrajinu ze začátku roku 2022 je Ukrajina stále více závislá na Muskově satelitní internetové službě Starlink, kterou platí americká vláda. V roce 2023 podnikla Muskova společnost SpaceX kroky k omezení využívání Starlinku na Ukrajině, což přimělo poradce ukrajinského prezidenta k poznámce, že se společnosti musí rozhodnout, zda jsou „na straně práva na svobodu“, nebo „na straně Ruské federace a jejího 'práva' zabíjet a zabírat území.“ V červenci 2023 deník New York Times zdůraznil, že Muskovy kroky měly přímý dopad na pokusy Ukrajiny získat zpět své území: 
V říjnu 2022 Musk na Twitteru zveřejnil anketu a „mírový plán“, jak vyřešit ruskou invazi na Ukrajinu.[83][84] Objevily se zprávy, že Musk před návrhem údajně mluvil s ruským prezidentem Vladimirem Putinem, což Musk popřel.[85][86][87] V srpnu 2023 po hovoru s Putinem navrhl vypnout Ukrajině připojení k internetu.[88] 
Musk byl kritizován za své veřejné komentáře a chování v souvislosti s pandemií covidu-19.[89][90] Šířil o viru dezinformace, včetně propagace široce zdiskreditovaného článku o prospěšnosti chlorochinu a tvrzení, že statistiky úmrtí na covid-19 jsou nadsazené.[91] 
V březnu 2020 Musk prohlásil: „Panika kolem koronaviru je hloupá.“[92][93] V e-mailu zaměstnancům společnosti Tesla Musk označil covid-19 za „specifickou formu běžného nachlazení“ a předpověděl, že potvrzené případy covidu-19 nepřesáhnou 0,1 % americké populace. Dne 19. března 2020 Musk předpověděl, že do konce dubna bude v USA pravděpodobně téměř nula nových případů. Politico toto prohlášení označilo za jednu z „nejodvážnějších, nejsebevědomějších a nejokázaleji nesprávných prognóz roku 2020.“[94] Musk také nepravdivě tvrdil, že děti „jsou vůči covidu-19 v podstatě imunní.“[95][96] 
Musk odsoudil lockdowny a zpočátku odmítl v březnu 2020 uzavřít továrnu Tesla Fremont, čímž se vzepřel místnímu příkazu k setrvání v práci.[89][97][98] V květnu 2020 otevřel továrnu Tesla, čímž se vzepřel místnímu příkazu k setrvání doma a varoval zaměstnance, že pokud se nedostaví do práce, nedostanou zaplaceno a mohou být ohroženy jejich dávky v nezaměstnanosti.[99][100] V prosinci 2022 Musk vyzval k trestnímu stíhání bývalého ředitele Národního institutu pro alergie a infekční choroby Anthonyho Fauciho.[101][102] 
V březnu 2020 Musk slíbil, že v případě nedostatku vyrobí Tesla přístroje na podporu dýchání.[103] Poté, co na Muskovu nabídku reagovaly osobnosti jako starosta New Yorku Bill de Blasio[104], Musk nabídl, že věnuje ventilátory, které Tesla vyrobí nebo koupí od třetí strany. Nakonec však koupil a daroval přístroje BiPAP a CPAP, což jsou přístroje, které podporují dýchání člověka schopného dýchat samostatně, a nikoli mnohem dražší a vyhledávanější mechanické ventilátory, které jsou schopny dýchat za pacienta zcela.[105][106] 
V září 2020 Musk prohlásil, že se nenechá očkovat vakcínou proti covidu-19, protože on ani jeho děti „nejsou touto nemocí ohroženi.“[107][108] O dva měsíce později se Musk nakazil, ale naznačil, že výsledky jeho rychlého antigenního testu jsou pochybné, protože byl čtyřikrát testován na stejném zařízení se stejnou zdravotní sestrou, ale obdržel stejný počet pozitivních a negativních výsledků.[109] V návaznosti na to postdoktorandka z Centra pro léčbu rakoviny princezny Margaret v Torontu na Twitteru vysvětlila, proč tento výsledek nepodkopává hodnotu testu, a označila Muska za „vesmírnou Karen“ („Space Karen“), což se následně stalo memem na Twitteru.[110][109] 
V prosinci 2021 Musk prozradil, že on a jeho způsobilé děti vakcínu dostali, a uvedl, že vědecké poznatky o vakcínách proti covidu-19 jsou „jednoznačné“, ale vyjádřil svůj nesouhlas s povinným očkováním proti viru.[111] 
Tvrdí, že je „velká šance na existenci jednoduchého života na ostatních planetách“, avšak „otázkou je, zda existuje inteligentní život ve známém vesmíru“.[112] Později vysvětlil své naděje, že „inteligentní život ve známém vesmíru existuje“ tím, že je to „pravděpodobnější, než kdyby nebyl, ale je to jen odhad“.[113] 
Často hovoří o potenciálním nebezpečí umělé inteligence (AI), označuje ji za „nejvážnější hrozbu pro přežití lidské rasy“. Během interview na sympoziu MIT popsal umělou inteligenci jako největší existenční hrozbu a dále „čím dál víc si myslím, že by měla existovat nějaká regulační ochrana, možná na národní i mezinárodní úrovni, abychom si byli jisti, že neuděláme nějakou hloupost“. Vytvoření umělé inteligence hodnotí termínem „vyvolání démona“.[114] 
Navzdory tomu investoval do firmy, vyvíjející umělou inteligenci DeepMind, a Vicarious (další společnost pracující na zvýšení inteligence strojů) a v roce 2015 spoluzaložil výzkumnou organizaci OpenAI. Při těchto investicích upřesnil, že tyto investice „nebyly provedeny z hlediska jejich návratnosti, ale kvůli dohledu na současný stav vývoje v oboru“. 
Také říká: „Ve filmech na toto téma, jako například Terminátor, se události vyvíjejí děsivě. A my bychom se měli postarat, aby byly dobré, ne špatné.“[115] 
Snaží se prostřednictvím kosmické společnosti SpaceX snížit náklady na vesmírné cestování. Právě SpaceX se stala první firmou, která uvedla do provozu vesmírné rakety na více použití. Hlavním cílem společnosti SpaceX je zahájení kolonizace Marsu.[116] První let vesmírné lodi Starship k Marsu je naplánován na rok 2022. Půjde o let bez posádky. O dva roky později se má uskutečnit let s posádkou.[117]

ISBN 978-0062301239. ↑ Junod, Tom (15 Νοεμβρίου 2012). «Triumph of His ...","Ο Ίλον Μασκ (μεταγράφεται συχνά και ως Έλον Μασκ), πλήρες όνομα Ίλον Ριβ Μασκ (Elon Reeve Musk), (Πρετόρια, 28 Ιουνίου 1971) είναι επιχειρηματίας, μηχανικός και εφευρέτης νοτιοαφρικανικής καταγωγής.[28][29][30][31][32] 
Ο Μασκ είναι ο γενικός διευθυντής και επικεφαλής τεχνολογικής ανάπτυξης για την εταιρεία διαστημικής τεχνολογίας SpaceX, της οποίας είναι επίσης ο ιδρυτής, καθώς και ο γενικός Διευθυντής και επικεφαλής τεχνολογικού σχεδιασμού της εταιρείας κατασκευής αυτοκινήτων και ενεργειακών συστημάτων Tesla, Inc. (πρώην Tesla Motors), και πρόεδρος της εταιρείας φωτοβολταϊκών συστημάτων SolarCity. Είναι επίσης ιδρυτής της εταιρείας Neuralink, που διερευνά τη συμβίωση ανθρώπου-τεχνητής νοημοσύνης, καθώς και της εταιρείας συστημάτων διάνοιξης σηράγγων The Boring Company, ενώ ξεκίνησε την επιχειρηματική του καριέρα ως συνιδρυτής των εταιριών Zip2 και PayPal.[33][34][35] Ανάμεσα στις διάφορες δραστηριότητες του, έχει επίσης οραματιστεί ένα σύστημα μεταφοράς υψηλής ταχύτητας με την ονομασία Hyperloop, έχει προτείνει ένα υπερηχητικό αεροσκάφος με ηλεκτρική προώθηση, καθώς επίσης είναι και ένας από τους πιο θερμούς υποστηρικτές της εξερεύνησης και αποίκισης του πλανήτη Άρη.[36] 
Στα μέσα Ιανουαρίου του 2021, ο Μασκ έγινε ο πλουσιότερος άνθρωπος στον πλανήτη, εκθρονίζοντας τoν διευθύνοντα σύμβουλο της Amazon Τζεφ Μπέζος. Η περιουσία του εκτιμάται ότι αγγίζει πλέον τα 203 δισ. δολάρια σύμφωνα με στοιχεία του Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index.[37][38] Τον Μάρτιο του 2020, η περιουσία του Μασκ είχε εκτιμηθεί περίπου στα 24,6 δις δολ.[39] 
Γεννήθηκε στην Πρετόρια το 1971,[40] με τους γονείς του να είναι η Μάγιε Χάλντεμαν, μοντέλο από τον Καναδά και ο Ίλον Μασκ, Νοτιοαφρικανός ηλεκτρολόγος και μηχανολόγος μηχανικός. Μεγάλωσε μαζί με τον νεότερο αδελφό του τον Κίμπαλ και τη νεότερη αδελφή του, την Τόσκα.[41][42][43] Οι γονείς του χώρισαν το 1980 και έκτοτε ο Μασκ ζούσε περισσότερο με τον πατέρα του στη Νότια Αφρική.[44] Στην ηλικία των 10 ετών άρχισε να πειραματίζεται με ένα υπολογιστή Commodore VIC-20,[45] και κατόπιν στην ηλικία των 12 έμαθε μόνος του προγραμματισμό ηλεκτρονικών υπολογιστών και πούλησε τον κώδικα που έγραψε για ένα παιχνίδι που είχε φτιάξει σε γλώσσα BASIC σε ένα περιοδικό υπολογιστών για περίπου 500 δολάρια Αμερικής.[46][47][48] 
Με την αποφοίτησή του από το Λύκειο στη Νότια Αφρική, μετακόμισε στον Καναδά το 1989, όπου και απέκτησε την Καναδική υπηκοότητα μέσω της μητέρας του.[49][50] Εκεί γράφτηκε στο πανεπιστήμιο Κουίνς (Queen's University) στο Οντάριο και κατόπιν συνέχισε τις σπουδές του στη Φυσική στο Πανεπιστήμιο της Πενσυλβάνια στις ΗΠΑ και αργότερα απέκτησε πτυχίο Οικονομικών Επιστημών στη Σχολή Οικονομικών Ουάρτον (Wharton School of Economics) του ίδιου Πανεπιστημίου. Κατά τη διάρκεια των σπουδών του ο Μασκ μαζί με έναν άλλο συμφοιτητή του αγόρασαν ένα κτήριο 10 δωματίων, το οποίο προσάρμοσαν ως νυχτερινό κέντρο διασκέδασης για άλλους φοιτητές.[51] Το 1995 μετακόμισε στην Καλιφόρνια για να ξεκινήσει το διδακτορικό του στην Εφαρμοσμένη Φυσική στο Πανεπιστήμιο του Στάνφορντ, ωστόσο πολύ σύντομα εγκατέλειψε τις σπουδές του ώστε να επικεντρωθεί στις επιχειρηματικές του δραστηριότητες στο διαδίκτυο, τις ανανεώσιμες πηγές ενέργειας και το διάστημα.[47] Το 2002 απέκτησε την Αμερικανική υπηκοότητα.[52][53] 
Το 1995 ο Μασκ μαζί με τον αδελφό του, χρησιμοποιώντας 28.000 δολάρια που τους παρείχε ο πατέρας τους, ίδρυσαν την εταιρεία Zip2, μια διαδικτυακή εταιρεία, η οποία παρείχε υπηρεσίες καταλογογράφησης και εύρεσης εμπορικών επιχειρήσεων.[51] Ο Μασκ κατάφερε να εξασφαλίσει συμβόλαια παροχής υπηρεσιών με τους Τάιμς της Νέας Υόρκης καθώς και τη Chicago Tribune,[54] μεγαλώνοντας έτσι τον κύκλο εργασιών της εταιρείας.[55] Η Compaq εξαγόρασε τη Zip2 για 307 εκατομμύρια δολάρια σε μετρητά και 34 εκατομμύρια σε μετοχές το 1999,[56] με τον Μασκ να λαμβάνει το 70% του ποσού (22 εκατομμύρια).[54] 
Το 1999 ο Μασκ χρησιμοποίησε 10 εκατομμύρια δολάρια από το ποσό που κέρδισε με την πώληση του Zip2 για να ιδρύσει τον διαδικτυακό τόπο X.com ο οποίος ειδικευόταν σε οικονομικές συναλλαγές και πληρωμές μέσω ηλεκτρονικού ταχυδρομείου.[55][57][58] Ένα χρόνο αργότερα η εταιρεία αυτή συγχωνεύτηκε με μια άλλη, η οποία διέθετε μια υπηρεσία μεταφοράς χρημάτων με την ονομασία PayPal.[54][59] Η νέα εταιρεία που προέκυψε από τη συγχώνευση των δύο επικεντρώθηκε στην υπηρεσία του PayPal και ονομάστηκε και η ίδια έτσι. Η ανάπτυξη της εταιρείας γνώρισε άνθηση με το Paypal να εγγράφει στο σύστημα του όχι μόνο αυτούς που έκαναν πληρωμές αλλά και αυτούς που τις λάμβαναν. Μετά από κάποιο καιρό το διοικητικό συμβούλιο έπαυσε τον Μασκ από γενικό διευθυντή βάσει διαφωνίας που ο ίδιος είχε ως προς την ενσωμάτωση των υπηρεσιών του Paypal στο λειτουργικό σύστημα Microsoft Windows.[60] Το 2002 το PayPal εξαγοράστηκε από το eBay για το ποσό των 1.5 δισεκατομμυρίων δολαρίων σε μετοχές, εκ των οποίων ο Μασκ απέκτησε 165 εκατομμύρια.[61] Πριν την πώληση ο Μασκ κατείχε το 11.7% των μετοχών της εταιρείας.[62] 
Το 2001 ο Μασκ ξεκίνησε να ασχολείται όλο και πιο ενεργά με την εξερεύνηση του διαστήματος και συγκεκριμένα με την εξερεύνηση του Άρη.[63][64] Το ίδιο έτος ταξίδεψε στη Ρωσία με σκοπό την αγορά παροπλισμένων και ανακαινισμένων διηπειρωτικών πυραύλων (Dnepr-1), ώστε να τους μετατρέψει σε οχήματα μεταφοράς εξοπλισμού στο διάστημα και προσπάθησε να συνάψει συμφωνίες συνεργασίας με Ρωσικές εταιρείες, που ασχολούνται με το διάστημα (NPO Lavochkin, Kosmotras)· ωστόσο δεν κατάφερε να κερδίσει την εμπιστοσύνη τους και επέστρεψε χωρίς ουσιαστικά αποτελέσματα στις ΗΠΑ. Επέστρεψε στη Ρωσία ένα έτος αργότερα, το 2002, έχοντας αυτή τη φορά μαζί του έμπειρους με το θέμα και καλά διασυνδεδεμένους επενδυτές (In-Q-Tel της CIA και Jet Propulsion Laboratory της NASA), ωστόσο υπήρξαν σημαντικές δυσκολίες και εντάσεις ως προς το κόστος της προμήθειας των πυραύλων, κάτι που έκανε τον Μασκ να θεωρήσει, πως θα του ήταν πιο σύμφορο να ιδρύσει μια δική του εταιρεία, η οποία θα κατασκεύαζε τους πυραύλους, που χρειαζόταν.[65] Σύμφωνα με τους υπολογισμούς του Μασκ, το κόστος των πρώτων υλών για την κατασκευή ενός πυραύλου θα ήταν μόλις το 3% του κέρδους από την πώληση του, κάτι που θα απέφερε μεγάλα περιθώρια κέρδους.[66] 
Χρησιμοποιώντας 100 εκατομμύρια δολάρια από την προσωπική περιουσία, που είχε έως τότε σχηματίσει, ο Μασκ ίδρυσε τη SpaceX τον Ιούνιο του 2002,[67][68] με τον μακροπρόθεσμο στόχο του -όπως δήλωσε- να είναι η δημιουργία ενός πραγματικού διαστημικού πολιτισμού. Κατά τα 7 πρώτα χρόνια της λειτουργίας της, η SpaceX σχεδίασε και κατασκεύασε τα διαστημικά οχήματα Falcon (απογείωσης) και Dragon (πολλαπλών χρήσεων), ενώ το 2009 το Falcon 1 έγινε το πρώτο ιδιωτικό διαστημικό όχημα, το οποίο τοποθέτησε δορυφόρο γύρω από την τροχιά της Γης.[51] Το 2012 ένα από τα οχήματα Dragon προσδέθηκε στον Διεθνή Διαστημικό Σταθμό μεταφέροντας προμήθειες και εξοπλισμό[69] και μετουσιώνοντας έτσι τις αντίστοιχες συμφωνίες, που είχε συνάψει με τη ΝΑΣΑ λίγα έτη νωρίτερα ως προμηθευτής διαστημικών οχημάτων και εξοπλισμού.[70][71][72]Ο Μασκ έχει δηλώσει πως επηρεάστηκε από το έργο του Ισαάκ Ασίμοφ[73] και πως θεωρεί την εξερεύνηση του διαστήματος ένα σημαντικό βήμα για την επέκταση και διατήρηση του ανθρώπινου είδους, με την παρουσία του ανθρώπου σε πολλούς πλανήτες να φέρνει μια σχετική ασφάλεια σε ότι αφορά την επιβίωση του ανθρώπου έναντι διάφορων εξωτερικών απειλών, όπως επιδημίες, αστεροειδείς, φαινόμενο του θερμοκηπίου και άλλων.[74] 
Το 2011 δήλωσε πως στόχος του είναι να μειώσει το κόστος των επανδρωμένων διαστημικών πτήσεων έως και 10 φορές το τρέχον κόστος,[75] ενώ σε άλλη συνέντευξη του ίδιου έτους δήλωσε πως ελπίζει να στείλει ανθρώπους στον Άρη στα επόμενα 10 με 20 έτη.[76] Στη βιογραφία του επίσης αναφέρεται, πως επιθυμεί να καθιερώσει μια αποικία στον Άρη έως το 2040, με ένα πληθυσμό που θα φτάνει τις 80.000.[45] 
Στις 25 Μαΐου του 2012, η SpaceX έγινε η πρώτη εμπορική εταιρεία που εκτόξευσε και προσύνδεσε διαστημικό όχημα στον Διεθνή Διαστημικό Σταθμό.[77] 
Στις 22 Δεκεμβρίου του 2015, εκτέλεσε την πρώτη προσγείωση πυραύλου εκτόξευσης, εγκαινιάζοντας έτσι τη νέα πρακτική όπου το πυραυλικό σώμα μπορεί να επαναχρησιμοποιηθεί και για άλλες εκτοξεύσεις οχημάτων.[78] 
Στις 30 Μαΐου του 2020, η SpaceX εκτέλεσε επιτυχώς την πρώτη επανδρωμένη αποστολή της στον Διεθνή Διαστημικό Σταθμό για λογαριασμό της NASA.[79][80] 
Παράλληλα με την κύρια δραστηριότητα της SpaceX, ο Μασκ δημιούργησε το 2015 την εταιρεία Starlink ως θυγατρική η οποία δραστηριοποιείται στην κατασκευή δορυφόρων χαμηλής τροχιάς για τους σκοπούς της παροχής δορυφορικού διαδικτύου. Οι πρώτες δοκιμές έγιναν τον Φεβρουάριο του 2018 με 2 δορυφόρους, και ακολούθησε δεύτερο στάδιο στις 25 Μαίου του 2019 με εκτόξευση 60 δορυφόρων.[81][82][83] 
Η εταιρεία κατασκευής ηλεκτρικών αυτοκινήτων Tesla, Inc. (αρχικά Tesla Motors) υπήρχε ήδη από το 2003, πριν ο Ίλον Μασκ επενδύσει σε αυτήν το 2004 και γίνει ο πρόεδρος της.[84] 
Μετά την οικονομική κρίση του 2008, άρχισε να ασχολείται όλο και πιο ενεργά και να συμμετέχει στις λεπτομέρειες του τεχνικού σχεδιασμού.[85] Το πρώτο όχημα της εταιρείας ήταν το Tesla Roadster, το οποίο είχε πωλήσεις περίπου 2.500 οχημάτων σε 31 χώρες. Το 2012 ακολούθησε το Tesla Model S, ενώ το 2015 έγινε διαθέσιμο στη αγορά το Tesla Model X.[86][87][88] Πέρα από την κατασκευή των αυτοκινήτων, η εταιρεία είναι και προμηθευτής ηλεκτρονικών συστημάτων αυτοκινήτων σε άλλες εταιρείες, όπως η Daimler, Mercedes και Toyota, ενώ οι εταιρείες αυτές είναι με τη σειρά τους και επενδυτές στην ίδια την Tesla.[89] Για να αυξήσει την απόσταση, που μπορούν να διανύσουν τα οχήματα, χωρίς να αντιμετωπίσουν πρόβλημα φόρτισης, προέβη σε συμφωνίες κατασκευής σταθμών φόρτισης ηλεκτρικών αυτοκινήτων σε πολλές περιοχές των ΗΠΑ.[90] 
Το 2014, ο Μασκ ανακοίνωσε πως η Tesla επιτρέπει την ελεύθερη χρήση της τεχνολογίας, που είχε πριν νομικά κατοχυρωμένη και κλειδωμένη, βάσει καλής πίστης και με το σκοπό να διευρύνει και να επιταχύνει την υιοθέτηση των ηλεκτρικών αυτοκινήτων στην αγορά, λέγοντας, πως ο πραγματικός ανταγωνιστής δεν είναι οι άλλες εταιρείες, που θα κατασκευάσουν ηλεκτρικά αυτοκίνητα, αλλά η αγορά των πετρελαιοκίνητων αυτοκινήτων.[91] 
Στις 29 Ιουλίου του 2016 ξεκίνησε τη λειτουργία του στο Ρίνο της Νεβάδα, το πρώτο Gigafactory της εταιρείας, προσδιορισμός τον οποίο η εταιρεία περιέγραψε ως εργοστάσιο το οποίο παράγει τουλάχιστον μια γιγαβατώρα (GWh) ανά έτος σε μπαταρίες. Έως τον Μάιο του 2020, το εργοστάσιο παρήγαγε 35 GWh/έτος, και βρισκόταν σε κατασκευή άλλα τέσσερα στο Φρίμοντ της Καλιφόρνια, Ώστιν του Τέξας, Σαγκάη στην Κίνα και Βερολίνο στη Γερμανία με παρόμοιες δυνατότητες. 
Τον Σεπτέμβριο του 2018 ο Μασκ και η Tesla υποχρεώθηκαν να πληρώσουν πρόστιμο 20 εκατομμυρίων δολαρίων που τους επιβλήθηκε από την αμερικανική επιτροπή κεφαλαιαγοράς, καθώς ο Μασκ ανακοίνωσε στην πλατφόρμα του Twitter πως είχε εξασφαλίσει κεφάλαια για τη μετατροπή της εταιρείας σε ιδιωτική και πιθανώς θα είχε τη δυνατότητα να κάνει κάτι τέτοιο, κάτι το οποίο κρίθηκε από την επιτροπή ως μη αληθές και επικίνδυνο για τους κατόχους μετοχών της εταιρείας. Ο Μασκ απάντησε πως οι κατηγορίες ήταν ανυπόστατες και πως δεν έκρυψε κάτι ή είπε κάτι που δεν ίσχυε. Εκτός από το πρόστιμο, ο Μασκ αναγκάστηκε να αποχωρήσει προσωρινά από πρόεδρος του διευθυντικού συμβουλίου της εταιρείας ενώ παρέμεινε γενικός διευθυντής. Έως τις 31 Δεκεμβρίου του 2019, ο Μασκ κατείχε 38.658.670 μετοχές που αντιστοιχούσαν στο 20,8% του συνόλου των μετοχών της εταιρείας. 
Έως τον Σεπτέμβριο του 2020, η Tesla είχε εξελιχθεί στην εταιρεία αυτοκινήτων με τη μεγαλύτερη χρηματιστηριακή αξία παγκοσμίως.[92] 
Ο Μασκ συνέλαβε την αρχική ιδέα και παρείχε την οικονομική υποστήριξη για τη δημιουργία της εταιρείας παραγωγής φωτοβολταϊκών συστημάτων SolarCity, την οποία ίδρυσαν τα ξαδέρφια του.[93][94] Παραμένει ο κύριος μέτοχος της εταιρείας, η οποία κατέστη ο δεύτερος μεγαλύτερος προμηθευτής φωτοβολταϊκών στις ΗΠΑ.[95][96] 
Τον Αύγουστο του 2013 ο Μασκ παρουσίασε μια πρόταση για μια νέα μορφή συγκοινωνιακού μέσου μεταξύ της ευρύτερης περιοχής του Λος Άντζελες και του Σαν Φραντσίσκο, την οποία ονόμασε Hyperloop.[97] Οργάνωσε μια ομάδα με μηχανικούς από την Tesla Motors και τη SpaceX, οι οποίοι μετά από έρευνα 9 μηνών ολοκλήρωσαν τον αρχικό σχεδιασμό για τη λειτουργία του συστήματος.[98][99][100] 
Η νέα αυτή μορφή συγκοινωνίας σκοπεύει να επιτρέψει την κάλυψη της απόστασης των 560 χλμ από το Σίλμαρ (Sylmar) στα βόρεια του Λος Άντζελες προς το Χεϊουάρντ (Hayward) στα ανατολικά του Σαν Φρανσίσκο μέσα σε 35 λεπτά ή λιγότερο, χρόνος ο οποίος είναι συντομότερος ακόμα και από αυτόν των εμπορικών αεροπορικών πτήσεων μεταξύ των δύο περιοχών.[101] Το στάδιο της κατασκευής αναμένεται να ξεκινήσει το 2016, ωστόσο υπάρχουν δυσκολίες σε πολιτικό επίπεδο.[102] 
Τον Δεκέμβριο του 2015 ανακοίνωσε τη δημιουργία του OpenAI. Πρόκειται για μη κερδοσκοπικό οργανισμό που ασχολείται με τη διεξαγωγή ερευνών στις τεχνολογίες τεχνητής νοημοσύνης. Σκοπός του οργανισμού είναι εν τέλει η ανάπτυξη γενικής τεχνικής νοημοσύνης με τρόπο ο οποίος θα είναι ασφαλής και ωφέλιμος για την ανθρωπότητα.[103] 
Καθιστώντας προσβάσιμες τις δυνατότητες της τεχνητής νοημοσύνης σε όλους, το OpenAI επιδιώκει να σταθεί ως εναλλακτική έναντι των μεγάλων εταιρειών οι οποίες αποκτούν δυσανάλογα μεγάλη επιρροή μέσω των συστημάτων τεχνητής νοημοσύνης που διαθέτουν και χρησιμοποιούν με αποκλειστικό σκοπό το κέρδος, καθώς και κυβερνήσεις κρατών οι οποίες ενδέχεται να χρησιμοποιήσουν τις τεχνολογίες τεχνητής νοημοσύνης για την εξάσκηση υπέρμετρου ελέγχου ή και καταστολή των πολιτών τους,[104] και εν γένει το OpenAI σκοπεύει να είναι αντίμετρο έναντι της υπερβολικής συγκέντρωσης εξουσίας μέσω της τεχνητής νοημοσύνης.[105] Το 2018 ο Μασκ αποχώρησε από το διευθυντικό συμβούλιο του οργανισμού για να αποφύγει ενδεχόμενη σύγκρουση συμφερόντων με τη θέση του ως γενικός διευθυντής της Tesla καθώς η Tesla ασχολείται σε σημαντικό βαθμό με την τεχνητή νοημοσύνη όλο και περισσότερο ειδικά στην αυτόματη οδήγηση.[106] 
Το 2016, ο Μασκ υπήρξε συνιδρυτής της Neuralink, η οποία πρόκειται για εταιρεία νευροτεχνολογίας με αντικείμενο τη σύνδεση του ανθρώπινου εγκεφάλου με την τεχνητή νοημοσύνη. Η εταιρεία επικεντρώνεται στην κατασκευή συσκευών οι οποίες μπορούν να εμφυτευτούν στον εγκέφαλο, με τον απώτερο σκοπό να είναι η σύνδεση των ανθρώπινων νοητικών λειτουργιών με το λογισμικό υπολογιστών και η συμπόρευση των νοητικών ικανοτήτων των ανθρώπων με την ανάπτυξη των δυνατοτήτων της τεχνητής νοημοσύνης. Οι επεμβάσεις αυτές ενδέχεται να μπορούν να επιφέρουν βελτίωση της ανθρώπινης μνήμης καθώς και απευθείας σύνδεση με υπολογιστικές συσκευές.[107] 
Ο Μασκ θεωρεί πως η Neuralink και η OpenAI έχουν παρόμοιο αντικείμενο, καθώς η OpenAI είναι μη κερδοσκοπικός οργανισμός ο οποίος ασχολείται με την ελαχιστοποίηση των κινδύνων της τεχνητής νοημοσύνης, ενώ η Neuralink ασχολείται με τη διασύνδεση της τεχνητής νοημοσύνης με τους ανθρώπους.[105] 
Στην ετήσια παρουσίαση που έκανε τον Αύγουστο του 2020, ο Μασκ περιέγραψε πως οι συσκευές αυτές θα έχουν τη δυνατότητα να θεραπεύσουν σοβαρά προβλήματα όπως παράλυση, κώφωση, τύφλωση, και άλλες σοβαρές αναπηρίες, δηλώσεις για τις οποίες του ασκήθηκαν επικρίσεις από μερίδα νευροεπιστημόνων.[108][109][110] 
Τον Ιανουάριο του 2017 ίδρυσε τη The Boring Company (μτφ. Η Εταιρεία Γεωτρήσεων, στα αγγλικά διαβάζεται αμφίσημα και ως Η Βαρετή Εταιρεία).[111][112][113] 
Τον Φεβρουάριο του ίδιου έτους, ξεκίνησε να κάνει την πρώτη διάτρηση σκάβοντας μια σήραγγα με διαστάσεις 9,1 μέτρα διάμετρο, 15 μέτρα μήκος, και 4,6 μέτρα βάθος, στις εγκαταστάσεις της SpaceX στο Λος Άντζελες.[114][115] Ο Μασκ περιέγραψε πως για την οικονομική βιωσιμότητα του συνολικού εγχειρήματος της εταιρείας είναι απαραίτητη μια δεκαπλάσια μείωση του κόστους ανά μίλι γεώτρησης.[116] Οι σήραγγες θα είναι βελτιστοποιημένες για χρήση μόνο από ηλεκτρικά οχήματα, κάτι που αποφεύγει προβλήματα όπως την ύπαρξη συστημάτων εξαερισμού για την απορρόφηση των ρύπων από τα οχήματα που βασίζονται σε μηχανές εσωτερικής καύσης.[117] 
Έως το 2018 η εταιρεία διεξήγαγε έργα ή ήταν σε θέση να ξεκινήσει στη Βαλτιμόρη,[118] Σικάγο,[119] και Λος Άντζελες.[119] Η δοκιμαστική σήραγγα στο Λος Άντζελες μήκους ενός μιλίου έγινε επισκέψιμη από το κοινό στις 18 Δεκεμβρίου του 2018.[120][121] Το 2019 η εταιρεία ξεκίνησε να εργάζεται στην κατασκευή νέου τύπου μηχανήματος διάτρησης με την ονομασία Prufrock.[120]:15:18–15:45  Στις 5 Απριλίου ανακοινώνεται η αγορά 73.486.938 μετοχών της εταιρείας (9,2%) καθιστώντας τον μεγαλομέτοχο της εταιρείας.[122] Στις 25 Απριλίου 2022 ανακοινώθηκε η εξαγορά του Twitter από τον Ίλον Μασκ έναντι 44δις δολλαρίων.[123] Με βάση τους όρους της συμφωνίας, οι μέτοχοι θα λάβουν 54,20 δολάρια ανά μετοχή. Ο Μασκ έχει δηλώσει ότι σκοπεύει να αποσύρει την εταιρεία από το χρηματιστήριο, στο οποίο εισήχθη το 2013.[124][125] Αρκετές ώρες πριν επισημοποιηθεί από διάφορα μέσα του χώρου ο Μασκ έκανε ένα tweet που ουσιαστικά πολλοί ερμήνευσαν ως την πρώτη εξαγγελία πως πλέον το Twitter του ανήκει: Ελπίζω ότι ακόμη και οι χειρότεροι επικριτές μου θα παραμείνουν στο Twitter, γιατί αυτό σημαίνει ελευθερία του λόγου.[126] Ο συνιδρυτής του Twitter, Τζακ Ντόρσι, σχολίασε δημόσια από τους πρώτους την αγορά καθώς δήλωσε για τον Μασκ γράφοντας ως tweet: ο Ίλον είναι η μόνη λύση που εμπιστεύομαι[127] Ο Μασκ δημοσίευσε στους ακόλουθους του τα μελλοντικά του σχέδια που έχει για την πλατφόρμα και σε ποιες θεμελιώσεις αρχές θα βασίζεται: Η ελευθερία του λόγου είναι το θεμέλιο μιας δημοκρατίας που λειτουργεί και το Twitter είναι η ψηφιακή πλατεία της πόλης, όπου συζητούνται θέματα ζωτικής σημασίας για το μέλλον της ανθρωπότητας. Το Twitter έχει τεράστιες δυνατότητες - ανυπομονώ να συνεργαστώ με την εταιρεία και την κοινότητα των χρηστών για να το ""ξεκλειδώσουμε""[128] Κορυφαία προτεραιότητα για τον Μασκ, όπως έχει δηλώσει, είναι να δώσει τέλος στο φαινόμενο των «στρατών bot», δηλαδή σε λογαριασμούς spam, που είτε θέλουν να προωθήσουν προπαγάνδα είτε να εξαπατήσουν χρήστες. Στο παρελθόν, ο 'Ιλον Μασκ είχε πραγματοποιήσει δημοσκόπηση για τη δυνατότητα να ενσωματωθεί μία λειτουργία επεξεργασίας (edit button), ώστε οι χρήστες να μπορούν να διορθώνουν, να προστέθουν ή να αφαιρούν κάτι από τις αναρτήσεις τους. Περισσότεροι από 4 εκατομμύρια λογαριασμοί συμμετείχαν και πάνω από το 70% απάντησε «ναι». Σε συνέντευξή του ο Μασκ είχε αφήσει να εννοηθεί ότι θέλει αλγόριθμο ανοιχτού κώδικα για το Twitter. Αυτό θα έδινε τη δυνατότητα και σε άλλους εκτός της εταιρείας να προτείνουν αλλαγές και διορθώσεις.[129]
Λίγες μέρες πριν ο Ίλον Μασκ ολοκληρώσει την τελική αγορά του Twitter, ανάρτησε ένα αινιγματικό τουίτ στην ελληνική γλώσσα γράφοντας απλώς: διαλεκτική[130] Τη συγκεκριμένη ανάρτηση σχολίασε ο Γεώργιος Μπαμπινιώτης στο Πρώτο Πρόγραμμα της ΕΡΤ αναφέροντας: «Μέσα από τα ελληνικά ο Ίλον Μάσκ δίνει την αρχική προέλευση της λέξης. Αυτό για μένα ως ανάγνωση σημαίνει ότι επιλέγει μία λέξη που έχει αίγλη, δύναμη, δηλωτικότητα και πολυσημία στην ερμηνεία της...Η λέξη διαλεκτική είναι από το διαλέγομαι. Δηλαδή ανταλλάσσω ερωτήσεις και απαντήσεις. Κάνω μία συν-ζήτηση, μία συζήτηση από κοινού με κάποιον άλλον. Μία συζήτηση που είναι της αλήθειας, με επιχειρήματα και αντεπιχειρήματα. Και από την πρόθεση διά, η οποία δηλώνει αμοιβαιότητα δηλαδή δίνω και παίρνω. Δεν είμαι μόνος μου, δεν ακούω τον εαυτό μου και τη φωνή μου, αλλά ακούω και τον άλλον. Αυτό άλλωστε είναι η διαλεκτική τέχνη που ξεκινάει όπως έχει γίνει κυρίως γνωστό από τον Σωκράτη στους πλατωνικούς διαλόγους».[131] 
Ο Ίλον Μασκ εν τέλει είχε προθεσμία να ολοκληρώσει την αγορά του Twitter, αξίας 44 δισεκατομμυρίων δολαρίων, μέχρι την 28η Οκτωβρίου, όπου είχε λάβει δάνειο 13 δισεκατομμυρίων για να χρηματοδοτήσει την εξαγορά.[132] Στις 26 Οκτωβρίου, επισκέφτηκε τα κεντρικά γραφεία της εταιρείας με ένα νεροχύτη στα χέρια του λέγοντας «let that sink in» που σημαίνει στα ελληνικά «χωνέψτε το».[133] 
Ο Μασκ περιγράφει τον εαυτό του σε σχέση με τα πολιτικά κόμματα στις ΗΠΑ ως μισό Δημοκράτη και μισό Ρεπουμπλικανό, κοινωνικά φιλελεύθερο και οικονομικά αυστηρό.[134] Έχει επίσης εκφράσει τον θαυμασμό του για τη Μάργκαρετ Θάτσερ, αναφέροντας πως ήταν σκληρή, αλλά δίκαιη.[135] 
Θεωρεί τον εαυτό του φανατικό Αμερικανό και πατριώτη και πιστεύει, πως η Αμερική είναι η καλύτερη χώρα στον κόσμο και ότι χωρίς αυτή δεν θα υπήρχε Δημοκρατία στον κόσμο μετά τους δύο Παγκόσμιους Πολέμους και τον Ψυχρό πόλεμο που ακολούθησε.[136] 
Έχει υπάρξει χορηγός τόσο των Δημοκρατικών όσο και των Ρεμπουμπλικανών, αναφέροντας, πως αν κάποιος θέλει να ακουστεί στην Ουάσινγκτον πρέπει να κάνει κάποιες συνεισφορές.[137][138] Συγκεκριμένα η SpaceX φέρεται να έχει κάνει υψηλές χορηγίες σε μέλη του Αμερικανικού Κογκρέσου, καθώς και στις προεκλογικές εκστρατείες του Τζωρτζ Μπους[139] και Μπάρακ Ομπάμα, καθώς και άλλων.[137][140][141] 
Ο ίδιος θεωρεί πως η κλιματική αλλαγή είναι σημαντική απειλή για την ανθρωπότητα, ωστόσο έχει δεχτεί κριτική για το πόσο ειλικρινής είναι στην τοποθέτησή του αυτή, τη στιγμή που κάνει χορηγίες σε πολιτικούς με αντίθετες θέσεις.[140][142][143] 
Επιπλέον έχει δηλώσει, πως δεν θεωρεί, πως η κυβέρνηση των ΗΠΑ θα πρέπει να συνεχίσει να δίνει επιδοτήσεις σε περιβαλλοντικά φιλικές εταιρείες, όπως έκανε και με την Tesla Motors και τη SolarCity στο παρελθόν, επιβραβεύοντας την καλή συμπεριφορά, αλλά πως αντ' αυτού θα πρέπει να εισάγει φόρους ρύπων, ώστε να αποθαρρύνει την κακή συμπεριφορά εταιρειών, που μολύνουν το περιβάλλον. Για τις δηλώσεις του αυτές υπέστη ευρεία κριτική από όλες τις πλευρές.[144][145][146] 
Ο ίδιος δεν είναι θρήσκος, ενώ θεωρεί πως η θρησκεία και η επιστήμη μάλλον δεν μπορούν να συνυπάρξουν, ενώ οι απαντήσεις στα πιο σύνθετα και φιλοσοφικά ερωτήματα όπως το από πού προέρχονται τα πάντα, μπορούν να εξηγηθούν με τους νόμους της φυσικής, λύνοντας το σύνθετο πρόβλημα με συνδυασμό απλών στοιχείων.[147][148] 
Θεωρεί, πως υπάρχουν πολλές πιθανότητες να υπάρχουν πρωτόγονες μορφές ζωής σε άλλους πλανήτες, ωστόσο δεν είναι βέβαιος για το αν υπάρχουν άλλες νοήμονες μορφές ζωής, χωρίς να το αποκλείει.[148][149] Σε περίπτωση όπου δεν σταθεί δυνατό να βρεθούν άλλες μορφές ζωής μακροπρόθεσμα, τότε θεωρεί πως μπορεί να ισχύει η υπόθεση της προσομοιωμένης πραγματικότητας, όπου κάποιος εξωγήινος πολιτισμός εντελώς απρόσιτος προς τους ανθρώπους, έχει δημιουργήσει μια προσομοίωση σε ελεγχόμενο περιβάλλον, παρακολουθώντας το πως εξελίσσεται και αναπτύσσεται η ζωή στη Γη.[150] 
Ο Μασκ έχει αναφερθεί αρκετές φορές στους κινδύνους της τεχνητής νοημοσύνης αναφέροντας πως πρόκειται για την πιο σοβαρή υπαρξιακή απειλή του ανθρώπινου είδους και θεωρώντας πως θα πρέπει κάποια στιγμή να υπάρξει μια ρυθμιστική αρχή η οποία θα θέσει κανόνες και διαδικασίες που θα αποτρέψουν το ανθρώπινο είδος από το να κάνει κάτι που θα είναι απρόσεκτο, ανόητο και επικίνδυνο, κάτι που παρομοίασε ως την επίκληση του δαίμονα.[151] Ο ίδιος έχει υπάρξει επενδυτής σε εταιρείες τεχνητής νοημοσύνης, αναφέροντας πως θέλει να παρακολουθεί από κοντά τις εξελίξεις.[152] 
Ο Μασκ κατείχε ένα αγωνιστικό αυτοκίνητο McLaren F1,[153] καθώς και ένα αεροσκάφος τζετ Aero L-39.[154] Διαθέτει επίσης πολλά άλλα πολυτελή αεροσκάφη και οχήματα, όπως ένα αεροπλάνο Dassault Falcon 900,[155] και ένα Lotus Esprit, το οποίο σκοπεύει να μετατρέψει σε αμφίβιο.[156] 
Έχει ιδρύσει φιλανθρωπικό ίδρυμα με την ονομασία Musk Foundation, το οποίο επικεντρώνεται στην παροχή συστημάτων ανανεώσιμων και ελεύθερων πηγών ενέργειας σε περιοχές, όπου έχουν πληγεί από καταστροφές.[157][158] Άλλες φιλανθρωπικές δραστηριότητές του περιλαμβάνουν την παροχή χρηματικών ποσών σε τεχνολογικά μουσεία,[159][160] οργανισμούς έρευνας για τον έλεγχο της τεχνητής νοημοσύνης[161][162][163] καθώς και τη γενική υποστήριξή του στην τεχνολογική έρευνα για ανανεώσιμες πηγές ενέργειας και διαστημικές τεχνολογίες.[164][165] 
Ο Μασκ παντρεύτηκε την πρώτη του σύζυγο το 2000 και χώρισε το 2008, έχοντας αποκτήσει 6 γιους.[166][167][168] 
Το 2008 γνώρισε τη δεύτερη του σύζυγο, με την οποία παντρεύτηκαν το 2010, χωρίζοντας 2 χρόνια αργότερα,[43][169][170] ωστόσο ξαναπαντρεύτηκαν το 2013, έκαναν αίτηση διαζυγίου το 2014, την οποία τελικώς απέσυραν το 2015. 
Στις 8 Μαΐου 2021, στην τηλεοπτική εκπομπή Saturday Night Live (SNL) αποκάλυψε πως έχει σύνδρομο Άσπεργκερ.[171][172][173] 
Ο Μασκ έχει λάβει μεγάλο πλήθος επιχειρηματικών και τεχνολογικών βραβείων και διακρίσεων για τις επιχειρηματικές του δραστηριότητες[74][174][175][176][177][178][179] και για την ενασχόληση του με τις διαστημικές τεχνολογίες[180][181][182][183][184][185][186][187][188][189][190][191][192][193], καθώς και επίτιμα διδακτορικά.[194][195][196]

Mudou-se para a Califórnia e fundou a empresa Zip2, uma ...","Elon Reeve Musk FRS (Pretória, 28 de junho de 1971) é um empreendedor,[3] empresário e filantropo sul-africano-canadense, naturalizado estadunidense. Ele é o fundador, diretor executivo e diretor técnico da SpaceX; CEO da Tesla, Inc.; vice-presidente da OpenAI, fundador e CEO da Neuralink; cofundador, presidente da SolarCity e proprietário do Twitter. Em dezembro de 2022, tinha uma fortuna avaliada em US$ 139 bilhões de dólares e tornou-se a segunda pessoa mais rica do mundo, de acordo com a Bloomberg, atrás apenas do empresário Jeff Bezos.[4][5][6] Em 2023, é o mais rico do mundo. [1]   Musk demonstrou publicamente preocupações com a extinção humana[7] e também propôs soluções, das quais algumas são o objetivo principal de suas empresas e já estão sendo feitas na prática. Entre elas, a redução do aquecimento global, através do uso de energias renováveis, um projeto multiplanetário, mais especificamente a colonização de Marte,[8] e o desenvolvimento seguro da inteligência artificial. 
Em janeiro de 2011, uma de suas empresas, a SpaceX, tornou-se a primeira empresa no mundo a vender um voo comercial à Lua. A missão, marcada para 2013, foi contratada pela empresa Astrobotic Technology, tendo como objectivo colocar um pequeno jipe na superfície lunar, o que não aconteceu. Em 2012, encerrou o projeto do Tesla Roadster, o primeiro modelo da sua autoria, um carro totalmente elétrico que custava cerca de 92 mil dólares. A Tesla já lançou quatro modelos: S, Y, X e o Modelo 3, este último com a responsabilidade de trazer os carros elétricos para as massas, partindo de um custo inicial de 35 mil dólares.[9] Em 25 de abril de 2022, ele também concordou em comprar o Twitter por 44 bilhões de dólares.[10] 
Musk tem sido alvo de críticas devido a posturas incomuns ou não científicas e controvérsias altamente divulgadas. Em 2018, ele foi processado por difamação por um britânico que ajudou no resgate da caverna de Tham Luang; um júri da Califórnia decidiu a favor de Musk. No mesmo ano, ele foi processado pela Comissão de Valores Mobiliários dos Estados Unidos (SEC) por tweetar falsamente que havia garantido o financiamento para uma aquisição da Tesla. Ele fez um acordo com a SEC, deixando temporariamente sua presidência e aceitando limitações ao uso do Twitter. Musk também foi criticado por espalhar desinformação sobre a pandemia de COVID-19. 
Elon Musk nasceu em 28 de junho de 1971, em Pretória, Transvaal, África do Sul,[11] filho de Maye Musk (née Haldeman), modelo e nutricionista de Regina, Saskatchewan, Canadá,[12] e Errol Musk, um engenheiro eletromecânico, piloto, marinheiro sul-africano, consultor e promotor imobiliário que já foi proprietário de metade de uma mina de esmeraldas na Zâmbia, perto do Lago Tanganica, o que ajudou a financiar o estilo de vida luxuoso de sua família adquirindo iates, férias em resorts de ski e computadores caros.[13][14][15] 
Musk tem um irmão mais novo, Kimbal (nascido em 1972) e uma irmã mais nova, Tosca (1974).[12][16][17][18] Sua avó paterna era britânica e ele também possui ascendência holandesa.[19][20] Seu avô materno era estadunidense, de Minnesota.[21] Depois que seus pais se divorciaram em 1980, Musk viveu principalmente com seu pai nos subúrbios de Pretória,[19] mas que depois disse que ""não foi uma boa ideia"".[22] Depois de adulto, Musk cortou as relações com seu pai.[22] Também, ele tem uma meia-irmã.[23] 
Durante a infância ele foi um ávido leitor.[24] Aos 10 anos, desenvolveu interesse em computação com o Commodore VIC-20.[25] Ele aprendeu de maneira autodidata programação de computadores aos 12 anos e vendeu o código de um jogo de vídeo baseado em BASIC que ele criou chamado Blastar para uma revista chamada PC and Office Technology por cerca de 500 dólares.[26][27] Uma versão web do jogo está disponível on-line.[26][28] Sua leitura da infância incluiu a Série da Fundação de Isaac Asimov, da qual ele tirou a lição de que ""você deve tentar tomar o conjunto de ações que provavelmente prolongarão a civilização, minimizarão a probabilidade de uma idade das trevas e reduzirão o tamanho de uma era das trevas se houver uma.""[22] 
Musk sofreu severamente com bullying ao longo de sua infância,[22] e foi hospitalizado quando um grupo de meninos o jogou por um lance de escadas e depois o espancaram até perder a consciência.[24][29] Ele se mudou para o Canadá em junho de 1989, pouco antes do seu 18.º aniversário,[30] depois de obter a cidadania canadense através de sua mãe nascida no país.[31][32] 
Com 17 anos de idade, Musk foi aceito na Queen's University em Kingston, Ontário, para estudo de graduação. Em 1992, depois de passar dois anos na instituição, Musk transferiu para a Universidade da Pensilvânia, onde em maio de 1997 ele obteve um diploma de bacharelado em física em sua faculdade de artes e ciências e um bacharelado em economia na Wharton School of Business. Musk estendeu seus estudos por um ano para terminar o segundo grau de bacharel.[24][33] Enquanto esteve na Universidade da Pensilvânia, Musk e seu amigo Penn Adeo Ressi alugaram uma república estudantil de 10 quartos, usando-a como uma boate não oficial.[24] 
Em 1995, aos 24 anos, Musk mudou-se para a Califórnia para começar um doutorado em física aplicada e ciência dos materiais na Universidade Stanford, mas deixou o programa após dois dias para perseguir suas aspirações empresariais nas áreas da internet, energia renovável e espaço sideral.[27][34] Em 2002, tornou-se cidadão dos Estados Unidos.[35][36] 
Em 1982, com apenas 11 anos, criou seu próprio jogo de video game, que mais tarde foi vendido para uma empresa sul-africana por 500 dólares. Formou-se em economia pela Universidade da Pensilvânia e um ano depois obteve um diploma de física. Mudou-se para a Califórnia e fundou a empresa Zip2, uma companhia que desenvolvia conteúdo para portais de notícias. Em 1999, a empresa foi comprada pela Compaq por 307 milhões de dólares e 34 milhões em ações.[37] 
Em março de 1999, Musk cofundou a X.com, uma empresa de pagamento de serviços financeiros on-line e de e-mail, com 10 milhões da venda da Zip2.[30][38] Um ano depois, a empresa se fundiu com a Confinity,[39][40] que tinha um serviço de transferência de dinheiro chamado PayPal. A empresa foi fundida e focada no serviço do PayPal, além de ter sido renomeada para a marca ""PayPal"" em 2001. O crescimento precoce do PayPal foi impulsionado principalmente por uma campanha de marketing viral onde novos clientes foram recrutados quando receberam dinheiro através do serviço.[41] Musk foi expulso em outubro de 2000 de seu papel como CEO (embora ele permaneça no conselho) devido a desentendimentos com a liderança de outras empresas, principalmente pelo desejo de mover a infraestrutura baseada em Unix do PayPal para o Microsoft Windows.[42] Em outubro de 2002, a eBay adquiriu a PayPal por 1,5 bilhão de dólares em ações, dos quais Musk recebeu 165 milhões de dólares.[43] Antes de sua venda, Musk, que era o maior acionista da empresa, detinha 11,7% das ações do PayPal.[44] 
Em julho de 2017, Musk comprou o domínio x.com do PayPal por um montante não revelado, afirmando que ele tem ""um grande valor sentimental"" para ele.[45] 
Com 100 milhões de dólares de sua fortuna inicial,[46] Musk fundou a Space Exploration Technologies, ou SpaceX, em maio de 2002.[47] Ele é diretor executivo e diretor de tecnologia (CTO) da empresa sediada em Hawthorne, Califórnia. A SpaceX desenvolve e fabrica veículos de lançamento espacial com foco no avanço do estado da tecnologia de foguetes. Os dois primeiros veículos de lançamento da empresa são os foguetes Falcon 1 e Falcon 9 (uma homenagem para a Millennium Falcon de Star Wars) e sua primeira nave espacial é a Dragon (uma homenagem para o filme Puff the Magic Dragon).[48] Em sete anos, a SpaceX projetou a família de veículos de lançamento Falcon e a nave espacial multiuso Dragon. Em setembro de 2008, o foguete Falcon 1 tornou-se o primeiro veículo de financiamento privado a colocar um satélite na órbita terrestre.[24] Em 25 de maio de 2012, a Dragon ancorou com a Estação Espacial Internacional, fazendo história como a primeira empresa comercial a lançar e embarcar um veículo para a EEI.[49] 
Ao trabalhar em conjunto com a NASA, Elon passou a acreditar que a humanidade deve ter outra opção para a eventualidade de uma catástrofe global, investindo na colonização de Marte. Em setembro de 2015, declarou que bombardear o planeta vermelho com armas nucleares seria a forma mais rápida de torná-lo habitável e mais parecido com a Terra, derretendo as calotas polares e libertando o dióxido de carbono acumulado sob a superfície, o que estimularia o efeito estufa e tornaria o planeta mais quente. Mais tarde, disse que não faria realmente isso.[50] Em setembro de 2016, ele anunciou um plano para levar humanos e estabelecer uma colônia em Marte.[51][52][53][54] 
Uma empresa que desenvolve e produz carros elétricos e baterias, a Tesla Motors é mais um projeto de Musk que pretende dar fim a supremacia do motor a combustão interna e, consequentemente, diminuir os efeitos do aquecimento global.[55] 
Com foco nos sedans e nos utilitários esportivos, em 2017, se tornou a montadora mais valiosa dos Estados Unidos, ultrapassando gigantes como a General Motors e a Ford, ainda que possua menor número de vendas e presença internacional.[56] 
A Tesla lançou, em 2018, o primeiro carro elétrico considerado relativamente acessível, o Model 3, por US$ 35 000. Entretanto, a empresa tem mostrado dificuldade em cumprir as metas de produção e, portando, suprir a demanda dos clientes. Elon Musk classificou esse cenário como ""production hell"". O CEO assumiu a culpa, mas disse que se trata apenas de um contratempo, causado principalmente por uma tentativa falha de automação quase total das indústrias em que o Model 3 é fabricado.[57] 
Nesse cenário, a The Economist chegou a noticiar que a Tesla precisaria de um financiamento de US$ 2,5 bilhões para manter suas operações. Musk, porém, afirmou que a empresa se tornará lucrativa ainda em 2018, portanto a análise da revista estaria equivocada.[58] 
Musk forneceu o conceito inicial e o capital financeiro da SolarCity, que foi então cofundado em 2006 pelos primos Lyndon e Peter Rive.[59][60] 
Até 2013, a SolarCity era o segundo maior fornecedor de sistemas de energia solar nos Estados Unidos.[61] A SolarCity foi adquirida pela Tesla, Inc. em 2016 e atualmente é uma subsidiária integral da Tesla.[62][63][64] 
A motivação subjacente ao financiamento do SolarCity e da Tesla foi ajudar a combater o aquecimento global.[65] Em 2012, Musk anunciou que a SolarCity e a Tesla estão colaborando para usar baterias de veículos elétricos para suavizar o impacto do telhado solar na rede elétrica.[66] 
Em 2016, a Musk cofundou a Neuralink, uma empresa de inicialização de neurotecnologia, para integrar o cérebro humano com a inteligência artificial. A empresa, que ainda está nos primeiros estágios da existência, está centrada na criação de dispositivos que podem ser implantados no cérebro humano, com o objetivo final de ajudar os seres humanos a se fundir com o software e acompanhar os avanços na inteligência artificial. Esses aprimoramentos podem melhorar a memória ou permitir uma interface mais direta com dispositivos de computação.[67] 
Musk vê a Neuralink e a OpenAI como relacionadas: ""O OpenAI é uma organização sem fins lucrativos dedicada a minimizar os perigos da inteligência artificial, enquanto a Neuralink está trabalhando em formas de implantar tecnologia em nossos cérebros para criar interfaces mente-computador ... a Neuralink permite que nossos cérebros mantenham na máquina de inteligência. As máquinas não podem nos surpreender se tivermos tudo o que as máquinas têm mais tudo o que temos. Pelo menos, isso é, se você admitir que o que temos é realmente uma vantagem"".[22] 
Em 17 de dezembro de 2016, enquanto estava preso no trânsito, Musk disse: ""Vou construir uma máquina de túnel e apenas começar a cavar ..."" A empresa recebeu o nome de ""The Boring Company"".[68] Em 21 de janeiro de 2017, Musk tweetou: ""Avançado progresso na frente do túnel. Planejo começar a cavar em um mês ou mais"".[69] O primeiro túnel começará no campus da SpaceX[70] e provavelmente irá para um local próximo de um estacionamento. Em 26 de janeiro de 2017, as discussões com os órgãos reguladores começaram,[71] mas nenhum pedido de autorização para cavar na área de Los Angeles foi arquivado no Departamento de Transportes da Califórnia no final de janeiro de 2017.[72] 
Em fevereiro de 2017, a empresa começou a cavar uma trincheira de teste de 30 pés de largura, 50 pés de comprimento e 15 pés de profundidade nas instalações dos escritórios da SpaceX em Los Angeles, uma vez que a construção não requer permissões governamentais.[73][74] 
Em dezembro de 2017, Musk prometeu que iria vender um lança-chamas. De fato, ele está disponível por US$ 500. São 20 mil unidades no total, e já foram vendidas mais de 7 mil.[75] 
Em 25 de abril de 2022, foi anunciado um acordo para Musk adquirir o Twitter pelo valor de 44 bilhões de dólares. Segundo o comunicado do Twitter, o conselho da empresa aprovou por unanimidade a compra, que foi concluída ao longo de 2022. Ao final, a empresa tem o seu capital fechado, tornando-se uma empresa privada. O negócio foi o maior da história envolvendo redes sociais.[10][76] 
Em 2013 Elon Musk apresentou o Hyperloop, um novo conceito de transporte de alta velocidade. O Hyperloop consiste em um tubo de baixa pressão com cápsulas, transportadas a grande velocidade ao longo do tubo. Permitirá viajar a alta velocidade, aproximando-se dos 1 200 km/h. A construção da ligação entre Los Angeles e San Francisco custaria 6 bilhões de dólares, muito menos do que os 75 bilhões de dólares previstos para o trem de alta velocidade. Esse meio de transporte será menos vulnerável aos sismos e menos exposto aos acidentes do que o comboio e o avião, “porque não se pode despenhar ou descarrilar”. O projeto do Hyperloop é apresentado como economicamente viável para ligações inferiores a 1 500 km. O preço de uma viagem entre Los Angeles e San Francisco seria de 20 dólares para os 35 minutos de viagem.[77][78] 
Em 2015, a Hyperloop Transportation Technologies anunciou que chegou a acordo com a Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum (uma empresa especializada em sistemas de vácuo) e com a Aecom (uma companhia de engenharia de design) para trabalharem em parceria na construção do Hyperloop. Engenheiros da Boeing e da SpaceX já estão envolvidos no projeto. No total, já há 400 profissionais a trabalhar no Hyperloop. Essas empresas preveem começar a construir uma ligação em tamanho real e já pronta para receber passageiros em 2016. A “pista” de testes, localizada em Quay Valley (na Califórnia), vai ter cerca de 8 quilómetros.[79] 
Em dezembro de 2015, Musk anunciou a criação da OpenAI, uma empresa de pesquisa de inteligência artificial sem fins lucrativos (AI). OpenAI visa desenvolver inteligência artificial de forma segura e benéfica para a humanidade.[80] 
Ao disponibilizar a AI a todos, a OpenAI quer ""contrariar grandes corporações que podem ganhar muito poder ao possuir sistemas de superinteligência dedicados aos lucros, bem como aos governos que podem usar a AI para ganhar poder e até oprimir seus cidadãos"".[81] Musk declarou que quer neutralizar a concentração do poder.[22] 
Depois que uma enchente de imprensa negativa mirando a Tesla deixou Musk ""frustrado"",[82] especificamente, artigos publicados pelo Reveal News criticando a Tesla por seus procedimentos de segurança,[83] Musk anunciou no Twitter que estava planejando criar um website onde usuários poderiam avaliar a veracidade de artigos em especifico, junto da confiabilidade dos jornalistas e publicações.[84] Ele sugeriu chamar esse site de ""Pravda"", por causa do jornal do Partido Comunista da URSS com o mesmo nome. Isso causou reações de muitos jornalistas, alegando que uma plataforma onde qualquer usuário pudesse votar na credibilidade de um artigo ou jornalista poderia sofrer abuso.[85][86] Depois de perceber que o site ""pravda.com"" era usado pelo jornal online Ucraniano Ukrayinska Pravda, Musk comprou o site pravduh.com em 25 de Maio de 2018.[87] 
Musk mencionou Teslaquila pela primeira vez num tweet de Dia da Mentira em 2018.[88] A tequila proposta com a marca da Tesla ficou perto de se tornar uma realidade em outubro de 2018, quando a Tesla requereu uma aplicação de ""com o objetivo de usar"" no U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.[89] A marca é para licor de agave destilado. Musk reafirmou sua intenção de lançar o produto por um tweet, apresentando uma maquete de garrafa, em 12 de outubro de 2018.[90] 
O Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council (CRT) já denunciou o produto publicamente, argumentando, ""Se ele quer tornar a Teslaquila viável como uma tequila, ele teria de se associar com um produtor de tequila autorizado, atingir certos padrões e pedir autorização do Mexico's Industrial Property Institute"".[91] 
Em julho de 2018, Musk tentou prover assistência à equipe de resgate durante o Resgate da caverna de Tham Luang ao mandar seus empregados construírem uma pequena cápsula de resgate. Musk, respondendo a pedidos de ajuda dos usuários do Twitter,[92] ordenou que engenheiros de suas duas empresas projetassem um submarino ""do tamanho de uma criança"" para ajudar na tentativa de resgate e publicou o processo no Twitter.[93][94] Os engenheiros de suas empresas SpaceX e The Boring Company construíram um minissubmarino com um tubo de transferência de oxigênio líquido do Falcon 9[95] e pessoalmente o levou à Tailândia. 
Chamado ""Wind Boar"" em homenagem ao time de futebol,[96] seu projeto, um tubo selado de 1,5 m longo e 5 cm de largura pesando cerca de 50 kg propulsionado manualmente por mergulhadores na frente e atrás,[97] tinha o objetivo de resolver o problema de transportar as crianças em segurança, que poderiam ter tido dificuldade em aprender as habilidades de mergulho necessárias para sair da caverna sozinhas e sem entrar em pânico.[98] Caso o minissubmarino não coubesse no sistema da caverna, Elon Musk também pediu à Wind Inflatables, uma produtora de botes infláveis baseada na Califórnia, que construíssem cápsulas de fuga infláveis. As cápsulas foram projetadas, fabricadas e testadas um dia antes de serem enviadas à Tailândia.[99][100] 
Nessa hora, oito das doze crianças já haviam sido resgatadas e as autoridades tailandesas decidiram não usar o submarino, descrevendo-o como tecnologicamente impressionante, mas não prático.[101][102][103] 
O supervisor da operação de resgate, Narongsak Osatanakorn, recusou o submarino como sendo ""não prático para essa missão"". O mergulhador britânico, Vern Unsworth, que havia explorado a caverna pelos últimos seis anos e havia originalmente localizado a equipe de futebol, disse que a ideia do Musk ""não tinha absolutamente nenhuma chance de funcionar....o submarino, acredito, tinha cerca de 1,7 m de comprimento, rígido, então não poderia ter feito as curvas ou circulado por nenhum obstáculo. Não teria passado dos primeiros 50 metros desde o ponto inicial"".[104][105] Musk tuitou que Richard Stanton, líder da equipe de mergulho internacional, havia anteriormente pedido a ele que continuasse a construção do minissubmarino como um backup, caso a enchente piorasse.[106] Apesar do dispositivo poder segurar um ocupante em segurança, o submarino não podia ser usado nessa operação, já que seu corpo rígido era um pouco menor que as passagens mais estreitas da caverna.[96] 
Quando a cobertura da mídia sobre o evento cresceu, alguns ficaram céticos quanto as intenções do Musk, alegando que o submarino foi principalmente construído como publicidade para Tesla e Musk, citando a aparente inutilidade do dispositivo.[107][108][109] Um dos mergulhadores dito ter feito um ""papel principal"" no resgate, criticou o submarino como sendo nada mais que um ""golpe de publicidade"" que ""não tinha absolutamente chance alguma de funcionar"" e ""ele não tinha ideia de como a passagem da caverna era"";[110] e disse que Musk ""pode enfiar o submarino onde machuca"". Musk reafirmou no Twitter que o dispositivo poderia ter funcionado e referiu-se ao mergulhador como sendo um ""pedófilo"" (""pedo guy"") sem oferecer nenhuma evidência que suportasse a alegação, causando repercussão contra Musk.[111][112] Ele subsequentemente deletou os tuítes, junto de outro anterior que ele falou para outro crítico do dispositivo: ""Fique atento imbecil"".[112] Em 16 de julho, o mergulhador declarou que ele estava considerando uma ação legal contra os comentários do Musk.[113][114] 
Depois dos tuítes do Musk, as ações da Tesla caíram 4% quando alguns investidores preocuparam-se com seu comportamento errático.[115] Investidores da Tesla subsequentemente ordenaram que Musk pedisse desculpa.[116] Dois dias depois, Musk emitiu um pedido de desculpa por suas declarações:[117][118] ""A culpa é somente minha e de ninguém mais""[119] e ""...minhas palavras foram ditas num estado de raiva...""[120] 
No dia 28 de agosto de 2018, em resposta a uma crítica de um escritor no Twitter sobre como Musk havia lidado com a crítica do mergulhador, ele retornou a acusação de pedofilia tuitando: ""Você não acha estranho que ele não tenha me processado? Ofereceram a ele serviços legais gratuitos. [...]"".[121] No dia seguinte, uma carta de L. Lin Wood, o advogado do mergulhador, datado de 6 de agosto, emergiu, mostrando que ele estava preparando-se para um processo por difamação.[122][123] 
Em 5 de setembro de 2018, um repórter do Buzzfeed News publicou um email escrito por Musk em 30 de Agosto marcado ""extraoficial"", dizendo ""Sugiro que você chame as pessoas que conheça na Tailândia, descubra o que está havendo de verdade e pare de defender estupradores de crianças, seu idiota do cacete. E quanto a essa ameaça alegada de processo, que magicamente apareceu quanto levantei a questão ... Eu espero pra caralho que ele me processe."" Musk confirmou que ele havia enviado o e-mail.[124] O mergulhador subsequentemente apresentou um processo por difamação na corte federal de Los Angeles no meio de setembro de 2018, com planos de também apresentar um caso similar no Reino Unido. O processo diz que ""Musk embarcou numa campanha de relações públicas para destruir a reputação [dos mergulhadores] ao publicar falsas e hediondas acusações de criminalidade contra ele ao público"", e procura US$ 75 000 em reparação.[125][126] 
Musk autodescreveu-se politicamente como ""meio democrata, meio republicano"". Em suas próprias palavras: ""Estou em algum lugar no meio entre o socialmente liberal e o fiscalmente conservador"".[127] Solicitado pelo surgimento de carros autônomos e inteligência artificial, Musk tem apoiado a renda básica de cidadania;[128] e adicionalmente apoia a democracia direta.[129] Ele descreveu-se como sendo um socialista, mas ""não do tipo que transfere recursos dos mais produtivos para os menos produtivos, pretendendo ser algo bom, enquanto na verdade causa danos"" - argumentando em vez disso, ""o verdadeiro socialismo procura o maior bem para todos"".[130] Ele apoia visando uma taxa de imposto inclusiva de 40%, prefere imposto de consumo a imposto de renda e apoia o imposto estadual, como a ""probabilidade de progênie ser igualmente excelente em alocação de capital não é alta.""[131] 
Musk tem descrito os Estados Unidos como ""[indiscutivelmente] o maior país que já existiu na Terra,"" descrevendo-o como sendo ""a maior força do bem que qualquer país já foi."" Musk acredita completamente que ""não haveria democracia no mundo se não fosse pelos Estados Unidos,"" argumentando que houve ""três ocasiões separadas no século XX onde a democracia teria caído - Primeira Guerra Mundial, Segunda Guerra Mundial, e Guerra Fria - se não fossem os Estados Unidos"". Musk também declarou que acha ""que seria um erro dizer que os Estados Unidos são perfeitos, certamente não são. Tem havido muitas coisas estúpidas e ruins que os Estados Unidos fizeram"".[132] 
Antes da eleição de Donald Trump como Presidente, Musk criticou o candidato ao dizer: ""Estou um pouco certo de que ele provavelmente não seja o indivíduo certo. Ele não parece ter o tipo de caráter que reflete bem os Estados Unidos.""[133] Seguindo a inauguração do Donald Trump, Musk expressou aprovação pela escolha de Rex Tillerson por Trump como sendo Secretário de Estado e aceitou o convite de aparecer num painel consultivo do Presidente Trump. Sobre sua cooperação com Trump, Musk subsequentemente comentou: ""Quanto mais vozes da razão o Presidente ouvir, melhor"".[134] Subsequentemente Musk demitiu-se de sua posição em Junho de 2017, como protesto à decisão de Trump de remover os Estados Unidos do Acordo de Paris sobre mudança climática.[135][136] 
Numa entrevista no The Washington Post, Musk declarou ser um ""significante (embora não de primeira linha) doador dos Democratas,"" mas também doa em grande quantidade aos Republicanos. Musk ainda declarou ""para ter sua voz ouvida em Washington, é preciso fazer uma pequena contribuição.""[137][138] 
Um relatório de 2012 da Sunlight Foundation, um grupo não partidário que rastreia os gastos do governo, descobriu que ""a SpaceX investiu mais de 4 milhões de dólares em lobbying no Congresso desde que foi fundada em 2002 e distribuiu mais de 800 000 dólares em contribuições políticas"" a Democratas e Republicanos. O mesmo relatório notou que ""a campanha da SpaceX para ganhar apoio político tem sido sistemática e sofisticada,"" e que ""ao contrário de muitas startups tecnológicas, a SpaceX tem mantido uma presença lobista significante em Washington desde o primeiro dia"". O relatório ainda notou que ""o próprio Musk doou cerca de 725 000 dólares para várias campanhas desde 2002. Em 2004, ele contribuiu 2 000 dólares à campanha de reeleição do Presidente George W. Bush, aumentando-a (para mais de 100 000 dólares)[139] para a campanha de reeleição do Barack Obama e doou 5 000 dólares para o senador Marco Rubio, que representa a Flórida, um Estado crítico para a indústria aeroespacial. (...) Somado, Musk e SpaceX investiram cerca de 250 000 dólares no ciclo eleitoral de 2012"".[137][140] Adicionalmente, SpaceX contratou o ex-líder partidário Trent Lott para representar a empresa, via o grupo lobista de Washington Patton Moggs LLP. Junto da Patton Boggs LLP, SpaceX usa várias outras firmas lobistas externas, que trabalham com os lobistas da SpaceX.[141] 
Musk tem sido um apoiante do Political action committee dos EUA, FWD.us, que foi iniciado pelo empreendedor Mark Zuckerberg e advogados para a reforma da imigração. Entretanto, em Maio de 2013, Musk publicamente retirou seu apoio em protesto contra as propagandas que o PAC estava fazendo que apoiavas causas como o óleoduto de Keystone. Musk e outros membros, incluindo David O. Sacks, também saíram, criticando a estratégia como ""cínica"".[142] Musk ainda declarou que, ""não devemos dar isso à política. Se fizermos isso, teremos o sistema político que merecemos"".[143] 
Em dezembro de 2013, Sean Becker, do website midiático/político Mic, chamou Musk de um ""completo hipócrita,"" declarando que ""[para] a época eleitoral de 2014, Musk contribuiu para o Longhorn PAC e o National Republican Congressional Committee - ambos que já financiaram campanhas de candidatos anticientíficos e antiambientalistas como a Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn)"".[143] Musk já contribuiu diretamente com o Senador Republicano Marco Rubio, que já foi acusado de ter posições parecidas sobre a mudança climática.[140] 
Musk já declarou não acreditar que o governo americano deva subsidiar empresas, mas em vez disso, deveria usar o imposto de carbono para cobrar a externalidade da poluição atmosférica e desencorajar ""mal comportamento. Musk argumenta que o livre mercado conseguiria a ""melhor solução"" e que produzir veículos danosos ao meio ambiente viria com suas consequências.[144] no entanto, suas empresas recebem bilhões de dólares de subsídios governamentais.[145] 
As declarações do Musk tem sido grandemente criticadas, com o professor Fred Turner, da Universidade Stanford, notou que ""se você é um empreendedor como Elon Musk, você vai pegar o dinheiro onde conseguir, mas acreditar ao mesmo tempo, como uma matéria de fé, que empreendedorismo e tecnologia são fontes de mudança social, não o estado. Não é tanto autoilusão, mas há o hábito de pensar que um indivíduo como sozinho, independente e não reconhecendo os subsídios que recebeu. Isso ocorre direto no Vale do Silício"".[146] O autor Michael Shellenberger argumentou que ""no caso do Musk, é difícil não ler isso como algo na defensiva. E acho que há um motivo financeiro para isso. Eles estão lidando com um monte de investidores quais subsídios não são bases para um negócio viável de longo prazo, e eles muito exageram a velocidade onde serão capazes de se tornarem independentes."" Shellenberger continua, ""todos iriamos ficar melhores se esses empreendedores fossem um pouco mais agradecidos, um pouco mais humildes."" Enquanto o jornalista e autor Jim Motavalli, que entrevistou Musk para High Voltage, seu livro de 2011 sobre a indústria dos veículos elétricos, especulou que ""Elon agora está olhando a partir do ponto de vista de um vencedor, e não quer ver outras pessoas vencerem porque elas receberam dinheiro do governo – E eu acho que as pessoas tem uma tendência, uma vez que foram bem sucedidas, de querer tirar a escada depois que subiram"".[147] 
Em 2015, as declarações de Musk passaram por ainda mais escrutínio quando um artigo do LA Times alegou que SpaceX. Tesla, SolarCity e os que compraram seus produtos haviam ou estavam projetados para receber em conjunto um total estimado de 4,9 bilhões de dólares em subsídios do governo no decorrer de vinte anos. Um exemplo é o estado de Nova Iorque, que está gastando 750 milhões de dólares para construir uma fábrica de painéis solares que serão arrendados à SolarCity por 1 dólar por ano. O acordo ainda inclui nenhum imposto de propriedade por uma década, numa avaliação de 260 milhões de dólares. Musk emprega um ex oficial do Departamento de Estado Americano como negociador chefe para a Tesla.[148] 
A Tesla Motors Inc., SolarCity Corp. e Space Exploration Technologies Corp., conhecidas como SpaceX, juntas se beneficiaram de um apoio governamental estimado em 4,9 bilhões de dólares, de acordo com dados compilados pelo The Times, uma variedade de incentivos governamentais que incluiu subsídios, incentivos fiscais, construção de fábricas, empréstimos com desconto e créditos ambientais que a Tesla pode vender, também inclui créditos fiscais e descontos para compradores de painéis solares e carros elétricos.[149] 
Em julho de 2020, após ser questionado no Twitter por um usuário que disse que ""não estava no melhor interesse do povo"" o ""governo dos EUA organizar um golpe contra Evo Morales"" para Musk ""obter o lítio"" da Bolívia, o empresário respondeu: ""Nós daremos golpe em quem quisermos. Lide com isso"". A mensagem foi apagada em seguida.[150][151] Em outubro de 2020, Luis Arce, do mesmo partido de Evo Morales, foi o vencedor das eleições presidenciais da Bolívia, o que marcou o retorno do Movimento ao Socialismo (MAS) ao poder depois da deposição de Morales em 2019.[152] 
Quando perguntado se ele acreditava se ""há algum tipo de destino envolvido"" na transição da humanidade para uma espécie multiplanetária, em vez de ""só física,"" Musk respondeu: 
Bem, acredito. Eu acho que há algum tipo de inteligência mestre arquitetando todas essas coisas? Acho que provavelmente não, pois você teria de dizer: ""De onde a inteligência mestre veio?"" Então isso meio que levanta a questão. Então eu acho que você realmente pode explicar isso com as leis fundamentais da física. Você conhece este fenômeno complexo a partir de elementos simples.[153] Musk já declarou que não reza ou adora qualquer ser, apesar de anteriormente já ter admitido que havia rezado antes de um lançamento importante do Falcon 1, perguntando a ""quaisquer entidades que [estejam] ouvindo"" para ""abençoar [o] lançamento"". Quando perguntado se ele acreditava que ""religião e ciência podem coexistir,"" Musk respondeu, ""provavelmente não"".[154] 
Apesar de Musk acreditar de que ""há uma boa chance de ter formas de vida simples em outros planetas,"" ele ""questiona se há vida inteligente no universo conhecido"".[154] Musk esclareceu que sua ""esperança é de que haja vida inteligente no universo conhecido,"" e declarou que é ""mais provável do que não, mas é uma adivinhação completa"".[155] 
Musk também já considerou a hipótese da simulação como uma solução em potencial ao paradoxo de Fermi: 
A falta de qualquer vida notável pode ser um argumento em favor de estarmos numa simulação.... Tipo quando você está jogando um game de aventura e você pode ver as estrelas no fundo, mas nunca poderá chegar nelas. Se não é uma simulação, então talvez estejamos num laboratório onde alguma civilização alienígena avançada que esta apenas vendo como nos desenvolvemos, por curiosidade, como mofo em uma placa de Petri.... Se você olhar ao nosso nível de tecnologia atual, alguma coisa estranha deve ocorrer com as civilizações, e eu quero dizer: estranha num mal sentido. ... E pode haver muitas civilizações uni planetárias, mortas.[156] Musk tem frequentemente falado sobre os riscos em potencial da inteligência artificial, declarando isso como ""a ameaça mais séria à existência da raça humana."" Durante uma entrevista de 2014 no AeroAstro Centennial Symposium do MIT, Musk descreveu a IA como ""a maior ameaça existência [da Humanidade],"" ainda declarando, ""Eu estou cada vez mais inclinado a pensar que deveria ter alguma supervisão regulatória, talvez num nível nacional ou internacional, só para ter certeza que não venhamos a realizar algo muito idiota."" Musk descreveu a criação da inteligência artificial como ""convocar o demônio"".[157][158] 
Apesar disso, Musk previamente investiu no DeepMind, uma empresa de IA, e Vicarious, uma empresa que trabalha para melhorar a inteligência artificial. Em janeiro de 2015, ele doou 10 milhões de dólares para o Future of Life Institute, uma organização focada nos desafios criados por tecnologias avançadas.[159] Ele é copresidente do OpenAI, uma empresa não lucrativa para pesquisar a inteligência artificial.[160] 
Musk tem dito que seus investimentos são, ""não do ponto de vista de tentar ter algum retorno financeiro... Eu gosto de só ficar em dia com o que rola com a inteligência artificial."" Musk continuou, ""Tem sido feitos muitos filmes sobre isso, sabe, como Terminator – onde ocorrem resultados assustadores. E nós devemos tentar fazer com que os resultados sejam bons, não maus"".[161] 
Em junho de 2016, foi perguntado à Musk o que ele pensa sobre a ideia de Humanos viverem numa simulação computacional, o qual ele respondeu: 
Eu acho que o argumento mais forte em favor de nós estarmos numa simulação seja o seguinte: 40 anos atrás nós tínhamos Pong – dois retângulos e um ponto. É onde estávamos. Agora, 40 anos depois, nós temos simulações em 3D foto realísticas com milhões de pessoas jogando simultaneamente e isso está ficando melhor todo ano. E logo teremos a realidade virtual, teremos a realidade aumentada. Se você assumir qualquer taxa de melhoramento, então os jogos vão se tornar indistinguíveis da realidade, apenas indistinguíveis.[162] Os avisos sombrios do Elon Musk sobre Inteligência Artificial o levaram a até algumas controvérsias. Ele e o fundador do Facebook Mark Zuckerberg já discutiram, com Mark chamando seus avisos de ""irresponsáveis"". Musk respondeu à censura do Zuckerberg dizendo que ele havia discutido sobre IA com Mark e descobriu que ele tem apenas um ""entendimento limitado"" sobre o assunto. Em 2014, Adam Elkus da Slate argumentou que ""nossa IA 'mais inteligente' é tão inteligente quanto um bebê – e somente quando se refere à tarefas instrumentais como recolhimento de informações. Muitos roboticistas ainda estão tentando fazer um robô pegar uma bola ou correr sem cair."" Elkus ainda disse que a analogia do Musk sobre ""convocar o demônio"" pode ser danosa, pois poderia levar à ""cortes duros"" no financiamento de pesquisa sobre IA.[163] 
O Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), um think-tank de Washington, premiou seu Annual Luddite Award para ""alarmistas divulgando o apocalipse da inteligência artificial""; seu presidente, Robert D. Atkinson, reclamou que Musk e outros dizem que IA é a maior ameaça existencial à Humanidade. Atkinson declarou que ""Não é uma mensagem muito boa se você quiser conseguir financiamento para a IA do Congresso para o National Science Foundation.""[164][165][166] Nature discordou em grande parte com o ITIF num editorial em abril de 2016, ficando no lado do Musk, e concluindo: ""É crucial que o progresso tecnológico seja feito com pesquisa sólida e com boas bases para antecipar os cenários que ela poderia causar... Se esta é uma perspectiva Ludita, que seja.""[167] Num editorial do The Washington Post em 2015, o pesquisador Murray Shanahan declarou que é improvável que uma IA de nível humano apareça ""em breve,"" mas que mesmo assim ""a hora de começar a pensar sobre as consequências é agora"".[168]  Num evento da Tesla, à margem do Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, em dezembro de 2017, Musk declarou que: Acho que o transporte público é doloroso. É uma droga. Por que você quer entrar em algo junto de um monte de gente, que não saem quando você quer que saiam, não começa quando você quer que comece, não termina quando você quer que termine? E não funciona direto. [...] É uma grande porcaria. Esse é o porquê de todos não gostarem disso. E tem um monte de estranhos aleatórios, um dos quais podem ser um serial killer, OK, ótimo. E esse é o motivo das pessoas gostarem de transporte individualizado, que vai aonde você quer, quando quiser.[169] Depois, ele rejeitou uma resposta dum membro da audiência de que o transporte público funciona de forma efetiva no Japão.[170][171] 
Seu comentário disparou um criticismo generalizado tanto do público quanto de experts em transporte. Brent Toderian, expert em planejamento urbano, começou a hashtag #GreatThingsThatHappenedonTransit que foi largamente utilizada por usuários do Twitter com o objetivo de desfazer a noção de Musk de que todo mundo odeia o transporte público.[170][172][173] Yonah Freemark, um urbanista e jornalista especializado em planejamento e transporte, resumiu as visões de Musk sobre transporte público como sendo ""É terrível. Você pode ser morto. Trens japoneses são terríveis. Transporte individualizado para todo mundo! Trânsito? Demanda induzida? Impactos da mudança climática? Ruas onde não se pode andar? Quem liga!"".[169] 
Jarrett Walker, um expert em transporte público conhecido e consultor de Portland, disse que ""o ódio de Musk sobre dividir espaço com estranhos é uma luxo (ou patologia) que apenas os ricos podem lidar,"" referindo-se à teoria de que fazer o planejamento das cidades levando em conta apenas as preferências de uma minoria geralmente não funciona para a maioria.[174][175][176] Musk respondeu com ""Você é um idiota,"" depois dizendo ""Desculpe-me [...] Quis dizer, 'idiota hipócrita'"".[177][178][179] A conversa recebeu uma quantidade significante de atenção da mídia e levou ao ganhador do Prêmio Nobel, Paul Krugman a comentar sobre a controvérsia, dizendo que, aparentemente, ""Você é um idiota"" é a ideia do Musk de um argumento convincente.[174][180] 
Musk tem recebido críticas sobre suas visões e ações sobre a pandemia de COVID-19.[181][182] No dia 31 de janeiro de 2020, ele conectou alguns aspectos da COVID-19 com a gripe comum e declarou que ""o pânico do coronavírus é besteira"",[183][184] e que ""o perigo do pânico é maior que o perigo do corona. Se passarmos a maior parte dos recursos médicos para essa doença, isso será ao custo do tratamento de outras doenças"".[185][186] Musk também tem sido criticado por tweetar alegações contestadas sobre a doença, incluindo a de que as ""Crianças são essencialmente imunes, mas idosos com condições pré-existentes são vulneráveis"", o que foi acompanhado por um gráfico mostrando que nenhuma criança havia morrido na Itália até 15 de março[187][188][189] e por dizer que ""Baseado no que está ocorrendo, provavelmente não terá nenhum caso novo ao final de abril.""[182][190][181][191] Em adição, ele promoveu artigos sugerindo que empresas de saúdes estariam inflando os números de casos do COVID-19 por motivos financeiros, promoveu um artigo sobre os benefícios da cloroquina que foi desacreditado e retirado do Google e retweetou um vídeo chamando pelo fim das medidas de distanciamento social, adicionando que ""os médicos tem bons argumentos"".[192][193] 
Quando o Escritório do Xerife do Condado de Alameda ordenou que todos os serviços não essenciais fossem fechados, Musk e a Tesla inicialmente refutaram a ordem, argumentando que a produção de veículos e a infraestrutura elétrica são setores críticos, citando o Departamento de Segurança Nacional dos Estados Unidos.[194][195][196] 
Musk chamou o lockdown de 'fascismo' numa chamada de rendimentos da Tesla, declarando: 
 [197] (em inglês) Posteriormente Musk lançou vários tweets opondo aos lockdowns mandatórios, tais como ""FREE AMERICA NOW"".[198] 
No dia 11 de maio Musk reabriu a linha de produção da Tesla em Fremont num ato de desafio contra as ordens do Condado de Alameda, mas respeitando as regras sanitárias do Estado da Califórnia. No mesmo dia ele tweetou: a ""Tesla está reiniciando a produção contra as regras do Condado de Alameda. Estarei na linha como todo mundo. Se alguém for preso, só peço que seja eu"".[199] Além disso, Musk anunciou que a Tesla estaria movendo seu quartel general para o Texas ou Nevada e que a empresa havia iniciado um processo contra o Condado de Alameda, desafiando o ""desligamento"" da fábrica de Fremont, processo este que foi posteriormente abandonado.[200][201] O Departamento de Saúde Pública do Condado de Alameda explicou que estava esperando pelo plano prometido pela empresa que entregaria no dia 11 de maio onde explicaria como protegeria a saúde dos trabalhadores durante a pandemia.[202] Na abertura de segunda-feira, 18 de maio, havia sido colocado para aprovação da Testa—a mesma data qual a Fiat Chrysler, Ford Motor Company e a General Motors também recomeçariam a produção.[202] No dia 2 de junho de 2020, um trabalhador da Tesla foi testado positivo para COVID-19 depois da abertura da fábrica em Buffalo, Nova Iorque, o primeiro caso desde que a empresa reabriu suas fábricas nos EUA.[203] 
A aeronave de 1994 do modelo Dassault Falcon 900 usada no filme Obrigado por Fumar foi registrada como Musk (N900SX),[204] e Musk fez um cameo como piloto de seu avião, abrindo a porta para Robert Duvall e acompanhando Aaron Eckhart abordo. Musk é dono do Wet Nellie, o Lotus Esprit do filme The Spy Who Loved Me do James Bond. Ele planeja convertê-lo em um carro submarino funcional, igual no filme.[205] 
Elon Musk pratica Jiu-Jitsu brasileiro, inclusive em junho de 2023 desafiou o magnata, Mark Zuckerberg para uma luta de MMA.[206] Zuckerberg aceitou o desafio de Musk, porém até o momento ambos ainda estão em negociações sobre a possibilidade de como será realizada a luta, além dos demais tramites, como escolha a de local, data, organização, entre outros.[207] 
Musk é presidente da Musk Foundation, que se foca em esforços filantrópicos para prover sistemas de energia solar em áreas atingidas por desastres. Em 2010, a Musk Foundation colaborou com a SolarCity para doar um sistema de energia solar de 25 kW para o centro de resposta à furacão da South Bay Community Alliance em Coden (Alabama).[208] Em julho de 2011, a Musk Foundation doou US$ 250 000 para um projeto de energia solar em Soma, Japão, uma cidade que recentemente havia sido devastada por um tsunami.[209] 
Em julho de 2014, os cartunistas Matthew Inman e William Terbo, sobrinhos netos de Nikola Tesla, pediram para Musk doar US$ 8 milhões para a construção do Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe.[210] No fim, Musk concordou em doar US$ 1 milhão para o projeto e também prometeu construir um Tesla Supercharger no estacionamento do museu.[211] 
Musk doou US$ 10 milhões para o Future of Life Institute em janeiro de 2015, para operar um programa global de pesquisa com o objetivo de manter a inteligência artificial benéfica para a Humanidade.[159][212][213] 
Desde 2015, Musk é um fiduciário do X Prize Foundation[214] e um signatário do The Giving Pledge.[215] 
Em outubro de 2018, num esforço de resolver a Crise aquífera de Flint, Musk e a Musk Foundation doaram mais de US$ 480 000 para instalar novas fontes de água com sistemas de filtração para permitir o acesso de água potável para todas as escolas de Flint (Michigan).[216] 
A irmã do Elon, Tosca Musk, é uma diretora cinematográfica. Ela é fundadora do Musk Entertainment e já produziu vários filmes.[217] 
Musk conheceu sua primeira esposa, a autora canadense Justine Wilson, enquanto os dois estudavam na Queen's University em Ontário. Eles casaram-se em 2000 e separaram-se em 2008.[218] Seu primeiro filho, Nevada Alexander Musk, morreu de Síndrome de morte súbita infantil (SMSI) com 10 semanas de idade.[219] Depois, eles tiveram cinco filhos através da Fertilização in vitro[220] – gêmeos em 2004, seguido por tripletos em 2006. Eles tem custódia compartilhada de todos os cinco filhos.[221] 
Em 2008, Musk começou a se encontrar com a atriz inglesa Talulah Riley, onde se casaram em 2010. Em janeiro de 2012, Musk anunciou que ele havia acabado com seu relacionamento de quatro anos com Riley,[18][222] tweetando para Riley, ""Foram quatro incríveis anos. Te amarei para sempre. Algum dia, você vai deixar alguém bem feliz"".[223] Em julho de 2013, Musk e Riley casaram-se de novo. Em dezembro de 2014, Musk pediu um segundo divórcio; entretanto, a ação foi derrubada.[224] A mídia anunciou em março de 2016 que os procedimentos do divórcio estavam de novo em andamento, dessa vez com Riley pedindo a separação.[225] O divórcio foi finalizado no fim de 2016.[226] 
Musk começou a namorar a atriz americana Amber Heard em 2016, mas separaram-se depois de um ano devido a agendas conflituosas.[227] No dia 7 de maio de 2018, Musk e a artista canadense Grimes revelaram que haviam começado a namorar.[228] Em 8 de janeiro de 2020, Grimes anunciou que estava grávida de seu primeiro filho.[229] A criança nasceu em 4 de maio de 2020.[230] De acordo com Musk e Grimes, o nome da criança seria ""X Æ A-12"", no entanto, o nome foi considerado ilegal sob a lei da Califórnia devido a caracteres que não consistem no alfabeto inglês.[231] A criança acabou sendo registrada como ""X AE A-XII"", sendo ""X"" o primeiro nome e ""AE A-XII"" o nome do meio.[232] Musk anunciou que havia se ""semi-separado"" amigavelmente de Grimes em setembro de 2021.[233][234] 
Numa aparente admissão de misturar zolpidem (Ambien) e álcool, Musk tweetou em junho de 2017: ""Um pouco de vinho tinto, vintage record, algum Albien ... e mágica!"".[240] Musk ganhou a atenção da mídia por mencionar publicamente uma combinação perigosa em sua rede social.[241][242] 
Na metade de setembro de 2018, Musk apareceu no podcast The Joe Rogan Experience onde discutiu sobre vários tópicos por 02h30min.[243] Em cinco dias, a aparição havia registrado 10 milhões de visualizações no Youtube.[244] Um dos maiores e mais controversos aspectos do programa foi Musk soprando de um cigarro feito de cannabis oferecido por Rogan. The Washington Post observou, ""Nas mãos da mídia, isso se torna a história da crescente instabilidade do Musk ..."".[245] As ações da Tesla caíram depois do incidente, o que coincidiu com a saída do Vice Presidente do Worldwide Finance da Tesla no começo do dia.[246] Fortune perguntou-se se o uso de cannabis poderia ter ramificações para os contratos da SpaceX com a Força Aérea dos Estados Unidos, embora um porta-voz da FAEU disse ao The Verge que ""Não é acurado que exista uma investigação"" e que a Força Aérea ainda está processando a situação.[247][248] 
Em 2021, em uma participação no programa Saturday Night Live, Musk afirmou ter sido diagnosticado com autismo.[249] 
Em Homem de Ferro 2 (2010), Musk conheceu Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) num restaurante e teve uma fala breve sobre uma ""ideia para um jato elétrico.""[278] 
Em janeiro de 2015, Musk foi um convidado especial, interpretando si mesmo nos Os Simpsons num episódio chamado The Musk Who Fell to Earth""; o episódio fez piada com muitas das ideias do Musk.[279] 
Em novembro de 2015, Musk apareceu num episódio de The Big Bang Theory interpretando a si mesmo, voluntariando-se numa cozinha pública com Howard.[280] 
Musk foi apresentado no documentário ambiental de 2015 Racing Extinction onde um Tesla Model S customizado foi projetado para ajudar a projetar imagens de espécies ameaçadas de extinção em edifícios públicos, tais como o Empire State Building e o Vaticano.[281] 
Em 2016, Musk apareceu como si mesmo no filme de comédia romântica Why Him? onde ele rapidamente conheceu um dos personagens principais, Ned Flaming, interpretado por Bryan Cranston, num bar durante uma festa.[282] 
Também em 2016, Musk foi referenciado por Dr. Martin Stein no show televisivo de viagem no tempo da The CW DC's Legends of Tomorrow. Durante uma viagem no tempo ao passado, Stein conhece sua versão mais jovem e se apresenta como Elon Musk, para esconder sua identidade.[283] 
Em outubro de 2017, Musk foi prematuramente imortalizado como um pioneiro histórico na série Star Trek: Discovery da CBS All Access. Passada no ano de 2256, o Capitão Gabriel Lorca tenta motivar um cientista em sua nave perguntando-o ""Como você gostaria de ser lembrado pela história? Junto dos Irmãos Wright, Elon Musk, Zefram Cochrane? Ou como um especialista de fungos fracassado. Um homenzinho egoísta que colocou a sobrevivência de seu próprio ego antes das vidas dos outros?""[284][285] De acordo com um artigo no techcrunch.com publicado um dia após a exibição do episódio, essa menção é ""também interessante por causa da omissão notável do fundador da Amazon e Blue Origin Jeff Bezos: Esse outro empreendedor espacial é também um grade fã de Star Trek e ele propôs e conseguiu um cameo em Star Trek Beyond como um ser alienígena, mas ele não mereceu menção de Lorca entre o pantheon do voo espacial.""[286] 
Musk é significantemente referenciado inúmeras vezes no álbum de 2017 da Hat Films, Neon Musk.[287] 
Em novembro de 2017, Musk apareceu como si mesmo no sexto episódio da primeira temporada do spin-off do The Big Bang Theory Young Sheldon. O primeiro pouso bem sucedido do primeiro estágio do Falcon 9 da SpaceX num drone ship em 8 de abril de 2016, é mostrado sendo coberto pela CNN. Isso é seguido por uma cena onde é mostrado Musk sozinho no escritório lendo o caderno que o jovem Sheldon mandou para a NASA em 1989 (uma cena mostrada antes no episódio) contendo cálculos detalhando como esse feito poderia ser realizado.[288]
